	abstract = {There has been an increasing interest in diverting food waste from landfills to enhance renewable resource production due to high greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable processing of food waste to generate renewable energy represents a significant, though underutilized, opportunity for producing energy. This study proposes an integrated model to simultaneously boost food waste valorization and reduce GHG emissions using geospatial analyses, a clustering algorithm, and a mixed-integer linear optimization program. We maximized net present value by optimizing network and configuration designs in the Illinois food waste system, using stand-alone anaerobic digestion and co-digestion at wastewater treatment plants. We identified the influences of techno-economic factors like prices and logistics parameters on the model objective, electricity production, digestate sales, and system configuration. Results show that installing anaerobic co-digesters at wastewater treatment plants with a total annual capacity of 9.3 million metric tons (Mg) could generate an 8.3% return on investment while reducing CO2 equivalent by approximately one million Mg annually. Tipping price, capital investment, operational cost, and food waste availability were the most significant factors to the net present value of the system. Anaerobic co-digesters were more economically competitive than stand-alone digesters which were only recommended when the tipping price of sludge was lower than food waste. Expanding digestate marketability is crucial to food waste valorization profitability using both stand-alone anaerobic and co-digestion. The minimum tipping prices to operate the anaerobic digestion system were 40 USD/Mg for food waste and 20 USD/Mg for sludge. Depending on the system size and tipping prices, anaerobic digestion and co-digestion could reduce CO2 equivalent between 29 kMg/y and one MMg/y. Expanding the current framework with advanced regional food waste prediction and other bioprocessing techniques will be essential for improving the profitability of food waste valorization and the circular bioeconomy in agriculture. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Despite the commitment of the United Nations (UN) to provide everyone with equal access to basic services, the construction sector still fails to reach the production capacity and quality standards which are needed to meet the fast-growing demand for affordable homes. Whilst innovation measures are urgently needed to address the existing inefficiencies, the identification and development of the most appropriate solutions require a comprehensive understanding of the barriers obstructing the design and construction phase of affordable housing. To identify such barriers, an exploratory data mining analysis was conducted in which agglomerative hierarchical clustering made it possible to gather latent knowledge from 3566 text-based research outputs sourced from the Web of Science and Scopus. The analysis captured 83 supply-side barriers which impact the efficiency of the value chain for affordable housing provision. Of these barriers, 18 affected the design and construction phase, and after grouping them by thematic area, seven key matters of concern were identified: (1) design (not) for all, (2) homogeneity of provision, (3) unhealthy living environment, (4) inadequate construction project management, (5) environmental unsustainability, (6) placemaking, and (7) inadequate technical knowledge and skillsets. The insights which resulted from the analysis were seen to support evidence-informed decision making across the affordable housing sector. The findings suggest that fixing the inefficiencies of the affordable housing provision system will require UN Member States to accelerate the transition towards a fully sustainable design and construction process. This transition should prioritize a more inclusive and socially sensitive approach to the design and construction of affordable homes, capitalizing on the benefits of greater user involvement. In addition, transformative actions which seek to deliver more resource-efficient and environmentally friendly homes should be promoted, as well as new investments in the training and upskilling of construction professionals. © 2023 by the author.},

Based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, this article analyzed the semantics of ship trajectory by using data mining methods such as the sliding window algorithm, explored ship berthing and berth-waiting operation events, and established models for calculating the congestion index at ports, as well as the time cost, capacity resource cost, and economic cost caused by ship delays to monitor and evaluate the ship operation congestion status at ports. The results showed that the monitoring and evaluation system for container ports based on AIS ship data can effectively monitor and evaluate the port congestion status and support the decision-making efforts of all parties on the supply chain, such as ports, ship enterprises, cargo owners, and shipping agents. © 2023},

	abstract = {Rapid advancement of industrial internet of things (IoT) technology has changed the supply chain network to an open system to meet the high demand for individualized products and provide better customer experiences. However the open-system supply chain has forced many small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) to adopt vertical integration by being divided into smaller companies with a distinctive business for each SME but a central alliance to produce a range of products and gain competencies. Therefore, existing models do not guarantee the protection of data privacy of individual SMEs. Moreover, especially for the IoT environment, collecting data in a secure way and revealing valuable knowledge in an IoT network is difficult. How to share data in a secure framework is of paramount importance in the internet of behavior field. In this article, a privacy-preserving data-mining framework is proposed for joint-venture industrial collaborative activities by combining federated learning and a "pre-large concept"of data-mining techniques. The novelty of the proposed approach is that, while mining high-utility itemsets (HUIs) from multiple datasets, it does not require direct data sharing. In the proposed method, the federated-learning framework can learn from aggregated learning parameters without scanning all data from different sets. The pre-large concept in this approach reduces the amount of scanning into different datasets. Thus, the approach makes it possible to train federated learning more quickly while protecting the privacy of individual data owners. The approach has been tested on real industrial datasets in a collaborative environment. Extensive experimental results show that the approach achieves high accuracy compared with conventional data-mining techniques while preserving the privacy of datasets.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {In recent years, consumers have shown considerable attention to functional foods that can provide various benefits. At the same time, the awareness of the problem of waste generation from the agri-food supply chains has increased; thus, scholars and practitioners are devoting great attention to sustainable food waste management. Within the wine processing, the production phase generates by-products such as marc, grape seeds, stems, and wine lees. In most cases, these by-products are treated as waste rather than as a resource, creating environmental, economic, and social impacts related to their disposal. By contrast, the reuse of oenological by-products in food production can have several health benefits, since they are rich in functional molecules such as fibres, polyphenols, and vitamin E, and can also trigger a circular economy model. The aim of this research is to investigate the acceptance of consumers towards bread enriched with oenological by-products through the application of k-means clustering, providing insights on the characterisation of groups of consumers based on their specific features and declared attitudes. The results showed three different consumers’ clusters, highlighting that the acceptance of this enriched bread is not influenced by the consumers’ socio-economic features, but it is related to consumers’ sensitivity. Therefore, target strategies should be put in place to inform consumers about the benefits associated with the consumption of bread enriched with oenological by-products. © 2023 by the authors.},

In this article, a systematic intelligent technique for procurement supply chain (PSC) optimization is proposed. In this technique, an integrated approach based on variational mode decomposition and long short-term memory network is used to predict the market price. Considering the factors, such as production plan and market fluctuation, a multiperiod dynamic purchasing model is built. A stacked autoencoder under bootstrap aggregation is then trained to evaluate suppliers automatically end-to-end based on various data. Finally, a multiobjective order allocation model is established considering the procurement costs and supplier scores, and solved by particle swarm optimization. The extensive experiments are performed using a realistic industrial application in a zinc smelter company. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique greatly reduces labor costs, improves the efficiency of PSC, and reduces the procurement costs of the company.  © 2014 IEEE.},

As a result, aiming to present a particular viewpoint of this topic, the paper utilizes three analyses—bibliometric analysis through Bibliomatrix R and VOSviewer, thematic analysis through Biblioshiny and text mining technique—topic modelling to give a summary of ESCM scientific investigation accomplished from 1975 to 2021. This study analyzes trends in publication, authorship patterns, and keyword usage. The study utilizes a probabilistic procreative model through structural topic modeling to decipher and extricate esoteric themes from ESCM-related research papers. According to this research, the most popular topics in the ESCM area are carbon emission, energy saving, risk and uncertainties, price regulations, smart grid, IoT, and game theory analysis. Other significant components include life cycle assessment, ICT system, static and dynamic transportation network equilibrium, and network modelling for evaluation and selection of suppliers.

This assumption, while ideologically sound, is questionable in practise because the authenticity and accessibility of data cannot be guaranteed in many circumstances. Inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent, and inaccessible data are common in supply chains and prevent the QMS from achieving its goal: assuring product and process quality to meet customer requirements. This study is one of the first to examine the impact of data quality and data latency on process control and quality analysis which are elemental parts of daily QMS activities, from a supply chain visibility (SCV) perspective. In this study, five propositions are made to show the relationships between technology, SCV, and data issues. More importantly, the study proposes a platform that integrates Blockchain (BC) technology, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and Big Data to solve data problems in SCV and QMS. We further perform fuzzy association rule mining (FARM) to show how the platform can solve quality analysis problems and complete a closed-loop process control cycle in manufacturing. We also explain the contributions of the integrated platform to QMS from four theoretical perspectives. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the platform and provide recommendations for future research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, green entrepreneurship has been at the center of attention as an effective strategy to maintain sustainability and create a competitive advantage for organizations in a circular economy. However, the successful implementation of this strategy requires organizations to have internal enablers. This study endeavored to identify and evaluate organizational enablers for green entrepreneurship in manufacturing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Iran. Identifying organizational enablers can help SMEs in facilitating the conditions for adopting green entrepreneurship. To these ends, organizational enablers were extracted by reviewing the literature and then, using the viewpoints of 17 active experts in different industries in SMEs, they were classified. In the next step, the “Best Worst Method” was employed to prioritize the identified enablers (5 factors) and sub-enablers (20 factors). The contextual hierarchical relationships between these factors were identified through the “Interpretive Structural Modeling” method. Using the Matrix of Cross-Impact Multiplications Applied to Classification (MICMAC) analysis, the driving and dependence powers of organizational enablers were computed and the enablers were clustered. Based on the results, among the five enablers, three including total quality management, circular supply chain management, and corporate social responsibility were the most important from the point of view of the experts.

The results of ISM analysis provided a seven-level hierarchical model and the relationships between them. The results of the MICMAC analysis led to the clustering of 20 organizational enablers in three main clusters: driving (nine factors), linkage (four factors), and dependent (seven factors).

Design/methodology/approach: The present study has opted for the grey clustering method to identify and analyse the drivers of resilient HCSC preparedness during health outbreaks into high, moderate and low important grey classes based on Grey-Delphi, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Shannon's information entropy (IE) theory. Findings: The drivers of the resilient HCSC are scrutinised using the Grey-Delphi technique. By implementing AHP and Shannon's IE theory and depending upon structure, process and outcome measures of HCSC, eleven drivers of a resilient HCSC preparedness are clustered as highly important, three drivers into moderately important, and two drivers into a low important group. Originality/value: The analysis and insights developed in the present study would help to plan and execute a viable, resilient emergency HCSC preparedness during the emergence of any health outbreak along with the stakeholders' coordination. The results of the study offer information, rationality, constructiveness, and universality that enable the wider application of AHP-IE/Grey clustering analysis to HCSC resilience in the wake of pandemics. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Possessing an efficient production line relies heavily on the availability of the production equipment. Thus, to ensure that the required function for critical equipment is in compliance, and unplanned downtime is minimized, succeeding with the field of maintenance is essential for industrialists. With the emergence of advanced manufacturing processes, incorporating predictive maintenance capabilities is seen as a necessity. Another field of interest is how modern value chains can support the maintenance function in a company. Accessibility to data from processes, equipment and products have increased significantly with the introduction of sensors and Industry 4.0 technologies. However, how to gather and utilize these data for enabling improved decision making within maintenance and value chain is still a challenge. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate on how maintenance and value chain data can collectively be used to improve value chain performance through prediction. The research approach includes both theoretical testing and industrial testing. The paper presents a novel concept for a predictive maintenance platform, and an artificial neural network (ANN) model with sensor data input. Further, a case of a company that has chosen to apply the platform, with the implications and determinants of this decision, is also provided. Results show that the platform can be used as an entry-level solution to enable Industry 4.0 and sensor data based predictive maintenance. © 2023, The Author(s).},

The construction and innovation of the new program of supply the chain faces huge challenges. This study aims to propose a smart resilient supply chain framework with a decision-making schema through the plan-do-check-act management cycle. It can enhance supply chain resilience and strengthen industrial competitiveness. Moreover, an empirical study of demand forecast and risk inference for semiconductor distribution is conducted as a validation. Through demand pattern clustering and forecasting for historic customer order behaviors, the demand status of each customer is classified, and an optimal planning solution is released to support decision-making. The result has shown the practical viability of the proposed approach to drive collaborative efforts in enhancing demand risk management to improve supply chain resilience. The proposed forecast model performs better than all four benchmark models, and the revised recall of the proposed risk reference model shows high accuracy in all demand risk levels. As supply chain resilience is about to be reconstructed due to the industrial revolution, a government and industry alliance should follow the resilient supply chain blueprint to gradually make the manufacturing strategy a technology platform in the Industry 4.0 era. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Knowledge graph technology plays an important role in knowledge supporting for efficient supply chain management (SCM) of manufacturing enterprises, a SCM knowledge graph can be constructed based on the relevant case corpus. In order to solve the problems of coarse concept granularity of event ontology knowledge in SCM cases, potential words of characters in the existing entity recognition models may not be matched or matched incorrectly, key features of entities with different lengths may interfere with each other in the expression of attention mechanism, and lack of a large number of annotation training samples, a top-down construction method of SCM event logic knowledge graph (ELKG) is proposed. Firstly, SCM event argument classes and class relations are defined, an event logic ontology model is built, and the event argument entities according to event logic ontology are labeled. Then, an active learning event argument entity recognition (EAER) model based on two-stage generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed. In GAN generator, an EAER model based on binocular attention-based stacked BiLSTM with CNN (BACSBN) is proposed, which combines word-level character feature attention mechanism and n-gram pooling feature attention mechanism to improve the attention to character features of constituent words and highlight entity key information with different lengths, respectively. Two-stage GAN adversarial training and label space attention mechanism are introduced to select the correct predicted label samples for active learning training. The experimental results show that BACSBN can improve the entity recognition accuracy, and the two-stage GAN's active learning can further improve the recognition effect on the basis of full annotation sample training, and can still maintain a high accuracy in the absence of a large number of manual annotation data. Further, according to the sentence pattern and keyword matching, the matching relations of argument entities are completed, and the SCM ELKG is constructed to provide knowledge support for autonomous SCM. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Delivering goods is crucial to the supply chain industry because it directly affects package delivery, a crucial aspect of real-time vehicle movement on which most e-commerce businesses rely. By improving the vehicle routing process, package delivery speed could be increased, and especially for medical emergency-related items, this will drastically impact the nature of delivery, cost, and time spent on it. This is being done to prepare an efficient routing model for the vehicle route, which will ultimately result in an improved path. As they have a variety of restrictions, the goal of this article is to identify the various parameters that, when used with a multi-objective optimization-based routing model, will satisfy the limit. The routing route may be made more efficient using ant colony optimization (ACO) in conjunction with an upgraded recurrent model of the genetic algorithm (GA). To achieve this, the ACO-GA optimization method known as metaheuristic link prediction (MLP) was used for parameter prediction. This method offers an evaluation of the relationship between the emission of CO2 (carbon dioxide), the trip region, and the other associated parameters. The authors of this study compare the findings of their prior work, which combined ACO and K-means clustering to get better results. Once the results are established, they will become the primary objective function of the optimization algorithm, which will be responsible for choosing the path that is connected to the parameter values. The complete procedure of the suggested method was simulated and evaluated using the publicly accessible data set of Solomon’s benchmark data set with the property pairs, and then it was compared with the ACO-K-means method. In addition to this, the current algorithm is compared with other vehicle routing algorithms to improve the process. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.},

Echoing the same global plastic production trend, our study reveals that the plastic debris that ends up in the ocean is growing exponentially, and global plastic production is expected to fluctuate between 500 and 600 million metric tons by 2025. From a research perspective, there is a remarkable shortage of publications empowering Blockchain technology (BCT) to address the plastic crisis. Little research is related to scaling up the plastic waste collection and re-thinking or re-designing products. There is no significant connection between ‘re-purpose’ and ‘innovation’.

The goal of this study is to create an intelligent supply chain (SC) management system that provides decision support to SC managers in order to achieve effective Internet of Things (IOT)-based logistics. Current research on predicting risks in shipping operations in the logistics sector during natural disasters has produced a variety of unexpected findings utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms and traditional feature-encoding approaches. This has prompted a variety of concerns regarding the research’s validity. These previous attempts, like many others before them, used deep neural models to gain features without requiring the user to maintain track of all of the sequence information. This paper offers a hybrid deep learning (DL) approach, convolutional neural network (CNN) + bidirectional gating recurrent unit (BiGRU), to lessen the impact of natural disasters on shipping operations by addressing the question, “Can goods be shipped from a source location to a destination?”. The suggested DL methodology is divided into four stages: data collection, de-noising or pre-processing, feature extraction, and prediction. When compared to the baseline work, the proposed CNN + BiGRU achieved an accuracy of up to 94%. © 2023 by the authors.},

Based on the monthly pork price fluctuations in China from January 2011 to August 2022, this study uses ARCH family models to assess the characteristics and laws of these fluctuations in China. The pork price fluctuations show obvious clustering, with external shock information from the previous month affecting the pork price in the following period; the pork market price is characterized by risk compensation, with the high risk of pork supply driving the pork price up. In addition, the pork price fluctuations are characterized by asymmetry, with a greater impact of good than of bad news on the pork price. Due to the pork industry’ low entry threshold and the existence of sunk costs, positive information on the pork market has a stronger impact on price fluctuations than negative information. To guide pork supply, we recommend improving monitoring and early-warning mechanisms in the pork market to identify the pork price volatility threshold and measure the price volatility. In addition, price index insurance products should be constantly strengthened, with different types of insurance products being offered to meeting the insurance demand of various sectors in the pig meat supply chain. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

	abstract = {In times of global crises, the resilience of production chains is becoming increasingly important. If a supply chain is interrupted, a cost-effective solution must be established quickly. In the context of Industry 4.0, the concept of smart manufacturing offers a solution for fast and automated decision-making in production planning. The core idea of smart manufacturing is the digitalization of the product life cycle and the linking of individual phases of this cycle. Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) plays an important role as the connecting element between design and manufacturing. An important prerequisite for CAPP is the automated analysis of 3D models of components. The aim of this work is the development of an automatic feature recognition (AFR) -method to recognize geometric manufacturing features and their properties from 3D-models and then store them in a knowledge base. In that way, the result of the design can be automatically analysed and compared with manufacturing information afterwards in order to achieve an automated process planning. Geometric and topological information of a 3D model (STEP-AP242 format) generated by CAD systems is extracted by a Python-script developed and stored in an ontology-based knowledge base. The extracted product data is analysed using a Python-script to identify manufacturing features. To provide a comprehensive extensibility of the model, geometric features are defined according to a layered and hierarchical structure. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Cities play a crucial role in regional sustainable development through trade linkages with surrounding economies. This study extends the inclusive wealth (IW) conceptual framework for footprint analysis, offering a comprehensive production–consumption perspective to measure regional sustainability. We empirically analyse the IW footprint for 1880 municipal-level economies in Japan by using their territorial IW accounting. We measure sustainability in the hierarchical value chains across cities and prefectures. Our findings suggest the unsustainability of production and consumption across cities in Japan, as the biased wealth clustering in cross-prefecture value chains led to wealth inequality. Additionally, we observe the distorted natural and human capital utilization characterized as the general depreciation of natural capital and shortage of human capital, which arise by the value chain participation. Our results underscore the importance of capital management and regulation in value chains. Sustainable development policy interventions must focus on optimizing inclusive capital asset management to maintain a non-declining level of wealth. This research unveils the intricate relationship between cities and their surroundings, providing valuable insights for policymakers aiming to enhance regional sustainability. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Product changeovers are especially critical for multiproduct environments where key production system requirements are flexibility, time, and quality. Massive waste of production time and environmental pollution increase with changeovers significantly. It is noted that the green supply chain is gradually emerging, and the environmental policies in countries are also increasing pressure on manufacturers globally. However, how to improve the changeovers’ environmental performance in manufacturing enterprise are not entirely focused. The present study aims to raise the changeovers’ time efficiency and reduce environmental pollution in the multiproduct production system. This paper first analyzes the characteristics of multiproduct production systems and the causes of inefficient work and pollution and then extracts the problems that need to be optimized. They are the frequent changeover work, complex operation programs, and load imbalance. Multiproduct Production Fast Changeover (MPFC) is developed based on these problems, which integrates the Analytic Hierarchy Process, Entropy Weight method, Divisive Analysis, and Firefly algorithm. In addition, Divisive Analysis’s distance calculation is improved for flexible clustering targets. Firefly algorithm’s exploration, exploitation, and population coordination mechanisms have also been enhanced. The effectiveness of MPFC is proved in a real multiple flow-lines production case: time efficiency was increased, while the multiple industrial pollutions and key resource consumption were also reduced. © The Author(s) 2023.},

It has become a hot research focus to use district metering area (DMA) for more efficient management and control of WDNs. This article proposes a multistage DMA planning method based on improved weighted spectral clustering and genetic algorithm, aiming to address issues such as high investment cost and large differences in the water network demand distribution. First, the actual case pipe network is transformed into an undirected weighted graph based on graph theory, and a similarity matrix is formed by combining the physical properties and hydraulic characteristics of the water network. Then, based on the similarity matrix, the weighted spectral clustering algorithm is used to preliminarily divide the WDN, and the performance of the water supply pipe network formed with different division quantities and different weighting schemes is discussed. Finally, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the arrangement of valves and flow meters on boundary pipes to generate the final configuration of DMA. The results show that the proposed method has a significant improvement in pipe network topology, hydraulic performance index, and economy compared with the traditional DMA method.  © 2023 The Authors.},

In this paper, we develop a hybrid deep learning-based fruit image classification framework, named attention-based densely connected convolutional networks with convolution autoencoder (CAE-ADN), which uses a convolution autoencoder to pre-train the images and uses an attention-based DenseNet to extract the features of image. In the first part of the framework, an unsupervised method with a set of images is applied to pre-train the greedy layer-wised CAE. We use CAE structure to initialize a set of weights and bias of ADN. In the second part of the framework, the supervised ADN with the ground truth is implemented. The final part of the framework makes a prediction of the category of fruits. We use two fruit datasets to test the effectiveness of the model, experimental results show the effectiveness of the framework, and the framework can improve the efficiency of fruit sorting, which can reduce costs of fresh supply chain, factories, supermarkets, etc. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Making strategic decisions and improving corporate performance have been transformed by the use of artificial intelligence (AI) into business operations. AI-driven methodologies provide sophisticated tools for analyzing enormous and complicated datasets, enabling companies to get insightful information and make decisions that were previously beyond the capability of humans. This abstract examines how AI is used to make strategic decisions and improve corporate performance. Organizations may use AI tools like machine learning, predictive analytics, and data mining to find patterns, trends, and correlations in data that indicate undiscovered possibilities and dangers. Businesses may proactively change their plans by using predictive modeling to foresee consumer behavior, market developments, and operational issues. Additionally, AI's capacity to handle real-time data enables swift decision-making, giving companies a competitive edge in industries that are changing quickly. AI helps with resource allocation, supply chain management, and inventory optimization in the context of business performance optimization. Modern algorithms streamline logistics, cutting costs and increasing effectiveness. Systems for personalized recommendations enabled by AI also increase revenue and customer satisfaction. Businesses may improve operational efficiency overall by streamlining operations, cutting waste, and utilizing AI-driven insights. This integration does not, however, come without difficulties. When using AI for decision-making, ethical issues, bias reduction, and data protection must come first. Additionally, even while AI supports human judgment, it still requires human interpretation to connect AI-generated insights to broader corporate objectives. In conclusion, the use of AI in corporate performance optimization and strategic decision-making heralds a fundamental change in the way companies function. Businesses get the adaptability and intelligence necessary to succeed in today's dynamic and competitive market by utilizing AI to analyze data, forecast trends, and improve operations. AI technologies have the ability to uncover previously unattainable value and encourage long-term success when used responsibly. © 2023, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Due to the ever-growing demands for electronic chips in different sectors, semiconductor companies have been mandated to offshore their manufacturing processes. This unwanted matter has made security and trustworthiness of their fabricated chips concerning and has caused the creation of hardware attacks. In this condition, different entities in the semiconductor supply chain can act maliciously and execute an attack on the design computing layers, from devices to systems. Our attack is a hardware Trojan that is inserted during mask generation/fabrication in an untrusted foundry. The Trojan leaves a footprint in the fabrication through addition, deletion, or change of design cells. To tackle this problem, we propose EVHA (Explainable Vision System for Hardware Testing and Assurance) in this work, which can detect the smallest possible change to a design in a low-cost, accurate, and fast manner. The inputs to this system are scanning electron microscopy images acquired from the integrated circuits under examination. The system output is the determination of integrated circuit status in terms of having any defect and/or hardware Trojan through addition, deletion, or change in the design cells at the cell level.

	abstract = {The latest surge of global uncertainty and disruptions in global supply networks put policymakers under pressure to emprise green innovations as a vital tool to address environmental concerns. However, producing green innovations doesn't always help in achieving environment-related sustainable development goals. Therefore, in this study, we endeavour to investigate to what extent green innovations are efficient in improving environmental efficiency. To this end, a network bias-corrected data envelopment analysis and clustering analysis is applied. The data used in this study covers 42 countries from different regions, spanning from 2000 to 2020. The results reveal that most countries have not made major advancements in environmental efficiency signifying the low level of green innovations utilization to achieve environment-related sustainable development goals (SDGs). Additionally, the results demonstrate a U efficiency curve for inputs-oriented green innovations efficiency over time, indicating that the initial stages of green innovations production are associated with a decreased return. However, over time, the efficiency exhibits an upward trend. The benchmarking analysis reveals that South American and European Union nations set the bar for other countries in terms of efficiently leveraging green innovations to achieve SDGs. Our findings also suggest that environmental efficiency is more dependent on green-supporting policies such as green energy production and green taxes. As a result, we conclude that achieving environmental SDGs while utilizing green innovations does not always result in the development of other SDGs. Therefore, policymakers need to prioritize pursuing a green developmental approach and supporting policies to achieve environment-related SDGs and other SDGs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The ubiquity of pathogenic E. coli isolate possessing antimicrobial resistance was investigated in seafood samples procured from major seafood supply chain markets established for export and domestic consumption along Tuticorin coast. Out of 63 seafood samples examined, 29 (46%) were found to be contaminated by pathogenic E. coli harbouring one or more genes of virulent potential. Based on virulome profiling, 9.55% of isolates belonged to enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), 8.08% to enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), 7.35% to enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), 2.20% to enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and 2.20% to uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC). All the 34 virulome positive and haemolytic pathogenic E. coli have been serogrouped as O119, O76, O18, O134, O149, O120, O114, O25, O55, O127, O6, O78, O83, O17 and clinically significant O111, O121, O84, O26, O103, and O104 (non-O157 STEC) serotypes in this study. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) (≥ 3 antibiotic classes/sub-classes) was exhibited in 38.23% of the pathogenic E. coli, and 17.64% were extensive drug resistant (XDR). Extended spectrum of β-lactamase (ESBL) genotypes were confirmed in 32.35% isolates and 20.63% isolates harboured ampC gene. One sample (Penaeus semisulcatus) collected from landing centre (L1) harboured all ESBL genotypes blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaTEM, and ampC genes. Hierarchical clustering of isolates revealed the separation of ESBL isolates into three clusters and non-ESBL isolates into three clusters based on phenotypic and genotypic variations. Based on dendrogram analysis on antibiotic efficacy pattern, carbapenems and β-lactam inhibitor drugs are the best available treatment for ESBL and non-ESBL infections. This study emphasizes the significance of comprehensive surveillance of pathogenic E. coli serogroups that pose serious threat to public health and compliance of AMR antimicrobial resistant genes in seafood that hinder seafood supply chain.

	abstract = {Instead of being merely an important embodiment of regional productivity, the manufacturing industry also serves as a significant sector of economic operation and the supply chain system that is highly dependent on resources and the environment. Studying the spatial pattern of the manufacturing industry and its environmental effect is extremely significant for optimizing the spatial layout of urban industry, allocating production factors in a rational manner, and promoting the green transformation of industry. In this regard, this study aimed to further reveal the spatial pattern characteristics of the regional manufacturing industry and its impact on PM2.5. Using data from micro-enterprises in the manufacturing industry in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, its spatial pattern characteristics are explored and an econometric model is constructed to analyze the impact of the manufacturing industry on PM2.5 by comprehensively applying approaches including kernel density estimation, nearest proximity index, and Dagum Gini coefficient decomposition. Three research conclusions were drawn: (1) an obvious “core-edge” feature is present in the spatial distribution of the manufacturing industry in the studied area showing an apparent pattern of “high in the east and low in the west”. The core density of the manufacturing industry in the central cities is significantly higher than that in the surrounding cities. (2) In the manufacturing industry and its subdivisions, the characteristics of spatial agglomeration are unveiled, while the agglomeration and spatial differences are diminished during the study period for the spatial equilibrium of the manufacturing industry. (3) A significantly positive impact is exerted on PM2.5 pollution that is not limited to local cities by the manufacturing industry, which, due to the development differences within the study region, is also heterogeneous. In view of this, policy proposals for aspects such as forging a green manufacturing cluster area, establishing an industrial integration development platform, giving play to regional advantages and technological potential, etc., are put forward in this study, so as to provide a useful reference for optimizing the industrial pattern and promoting the green transformation of industries. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {International seed trade networks (iSTNs) are complex networks formed by the trade of seeds between economies. We investigate the statistical properties of the international trade networks for maize seeds and rice seeds from the viewpoint of temporal directed and weighted networks. We find that most properties, including node and edge numbers, average in- and out-degrees, total and average trade values, network density and clustering coefficient, showed an increasing trend, which indicates that the increasing globalization of seed trade has led to more and more complete and dense trade networks. We also find that links with larger trade values have greater stability. In addition, we observe positive correlations between in-degree and out-degree, link reciprocity and in- and out-degrees, link reciprocity and in- and out-strengths and clustering coefficient and in- and out-degrees. In contrast, there are negative correlations between clustering coefficient and in- and out-strengths. Furthermore, we find that both networks are assortatively mixed in most years, which indicates that large exporters and importers are more likely to trade with other large exporters and importers. The structural properties of the two iSTNs of maize and rice share many qualitative similarities, but exhibit quantitative differences.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

With this purpose, the environmental information of BIST 100 firms was collected manually from sustainability reports; the raw data were processed; and the following seven themes identified the representing firms’ disclosure items: environmental management, climate change, energy management, emissions management, water management, waste management, and biodiversity management. The results indicate various hidden relations between the sector and disclosures, allowing us to generate sector-based rules between environmental disclosure themes. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nigeria, as the heartbeat of Africa and the largest resource-rich nation in the continent has been economically bedridden in recent times. This is mainly due to the lack of diversification of its economy and resources. This paper deals with the analysis of the Nigerian economy with a view of determining the constituents of its economic growth using cluster analysis-(an unsupervised machine learning) approach. Results from the two cluster analysis approaches used-(K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering) indicates that crude oil contributes mainly to the Nigerian economy in terms of revenue and it is clearly distinct from other resources/sectors which makes up the components of revenue generation in Nigeria. Spearman's correlation analysis shows that all the economic indicators considered are highly correlated with each other except with Petroleum and Solid Minerals. This is not unconnected with the fact that the Nigerian economy has been largely dependent on oil revenue over the years, besides the fact that sectorial linkages are limited. Policies aimed at the diversification of the Nigerian economy and promoting value chain across sectors is sine qua non to economic progress. The need to ensure that other sectors contribute meaningfully and tangibly to the Nigerian economy in the post-pandemic era should be revisited. © 2023},

	abstract = {The management of the supply chain for enterprise-wide operations generally consists of strategic, tactical, and operational decision stages dependent on one another and affecting various time scales. Their integration usually leads to multiscale models that are computationally intractable. The design and operation of energy hubs faces similar challenges. Renewable energies are challenging to model due to the high level of intermittency and uncertainty. The multiscale (i.e., planning and scheduling) energy hub systems that incorporate renewable energy resources become more challenging to model due to an integration of the multiscale and high level of intermittency associated with renewable energy. In this work, a mixed-integer programming (MILP) superstructure is proposed for clustering shape-based time series data featuring multiple attributes using a multi-objective optimization approach. Additionally, a data-driven statistical method is used to represent the intermittent behavior of uncertain renewable energy data. According to these methods, the design and operation of an energy hub with hydrogen storage was reformulated following a two-stage stochastic modeling technique. The main outcomes of this study are formulating a stochastic energy hub optimization model which comprehensively considers the design and operation planning, energy storage system, and uncertainties of DRERs, and proposing an efficient size reduction approach for large-sized multiple attributes demand data. The case study results show that normal clustering is closer to the optimal case (full scale model) compared with sequence clustering. In addition, there is an improvement in the objective function value using the stochastic approach instead of the deterministic. The present clustering algorithm features many unique characteristics that gives it advantages over other clustering approach and the straightforward statistical approach used to represent intermittent energy, and it can be easily incorporated into various distributed energy systems. © 2023 by the authors.},

The next trend that is emerging is the vision of creating shared value (CSV), which wants to move the supply chain toward solving social problems in a completely strategic way. This research intends to develop a step-by-step framework for evaluating and segmenting suppliers based on CSV criteria in the supply chain. In the first stage, the criteria for creating sustainable shared value (CSSV) are obtained through existing activities in the field of CSR. The obtained criteria are then divided into two categories, strategic and critical, and then the weight of each criterion is obtained using the best–worst method (BWM). In the next step, based on the Kraljic model, the suppliers are divided into four clusters using the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) technique. This framework helps the buyer to conclude and select purchasing decisions and relationships with suppliers through the lenses of CSV and sustainability. © 2023 by the authors.},

However, many of these studies analyze a limited number of documents, which does not always guarantee representativeness of results. This paper presents a smart bibliometric literature review of supply chain research. The objectives are: (i) to identify supply chain research interest and research impact across subject areas; (ii) to capture trends of supply chain research in the last four decades; (iii) to identify research domains related to supply chain and development of these research domains over time; (iv) to explore the impact of COVID-19 on areas of supply chain research. Authors process 116,759 documents related to supply chain research, published between 1969 and 2021, retrieved from the Scopus database. After providing statistics regarding research interest and research impact, they use a corpus of abstracts to perform topic modeling. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with Gibbs sampling, 13 research domains related to supply chain research are identified: Ecology; Food supply chain; IT support of supply chain; Retail-oriented supply chain; Risk and disruptive aspects of supply chain; Performance management; Value management and social aspect; Production; Sustainability & development; Models & optimization; Effective inventory management; Supply chain management systems; Supplier and logistic analytics.

	abstract = {Stakeholders have been pressuring companies to develop more environmentally friendly strategic and operational solutions. In this sense, companies are seeking alternatives that reduce the negative impacts of organizational activities, Circular Economy (CE) is one of the solutions with the greatest potential for success. Thus, the goal of this paper is to provide drivers for organizations’ transition from a linear to a CE. For this reason, content analysis was used as the scientific method, for being appropriate for the interpretation of qualitative data and the identification, clustering, and systematization of themes in a given field of knowledge. In the case of this work, a set of 30 articles with information related to the implementation and development of CE were analyzed, allowing the identification of 19 key elements of CE. These key elements were then grouped and systematized into four drivers: decision-making; capacity and training; sustainable practices; and green supply chain. Scientifically, this work contributes to the improvement and increase of the block of knowledge about the CE, because the drivers can be used to advance the state of the art and as a starting point for the development of new research. In an applied way, the drivers proposed in this article provide a range of actions for managers to make their companies greener and improve their organizational performance, thus contributing environmentally and socially to the planet. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {One of the blood components that can be extracted from whole blood is the platelet, which has a wide range of uses in medical fields. Due to the perishable nature of platelets, it is recommended that the separation occurs within six hours after the donation. Moreover, platelets constitute less than one percent of the whole blood volume, yet they are highly demanded. Given the importance of platelets in healthcare, their perishability, and their limited supply, an effective platelet supply chain leans on well-managed whole blood collection operations. In this study, we consider a blood collection problem (BCP) focusing on the collection of whole blood donations from the blood donation sites (BDSs). Different from the basic form of BCP, we consider the processing time limit (PTL) of blood and arbitrary donation patterns of donors as well as relaxing the assumption of assigning each blood collection vehicle (BCV) to a set of BDSs. Therefore, we define the non-clustered maximum blood collection problem (NCMBCP) as a variant of BCP. In this study, we examine routing decisions for platelet collections while relaxing the clustering requirement from the BDSs, which results in a significant increase in the complexity of the problem. In order to solve the problem, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) and an invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm that provide considerable improvements over the best solution in the literature for the clustered variant of the problem and outperform it (on average) by 8.68% and 8.16%, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Different phases of the chain are affected by developed technologies such as robotics, drones, and smart machines. Different capabilities are provided for different phases by the interaction of artificial intelligence with other technologies such as big data mining, machine learning, the Internet of services, agribots, industrial robots, sensors and drones, digital platforms, driverless vehicles and machinery, and nanotechnology, as revealed by a systematic literature analysis. However, the application of artificial intelligence is hindered by social, technological, and economic barriers.

In the first phase of the study, the resiliency factors of HSCs were identified through an extensive literature review and expert interviews. In the second phase, a machine learning approach, i.e., K-means clustering, was used to develop the futuristic blocks of OHSCR. Lastly, in the third phase, implications and future research propositions were discussed. The findings of this study suggest that the healthcare sector evaluating OHSCR should focus on six key building blocks: data-driven management and transformative technological adoption, flexible and transparent organisational management system, robust and diversified supply chain system, responsible and customer-centric supply chain, information sharing and knowledge management, and strategic alignment and network ecosystem.

	abstract = {Background: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the well-established tools for food metabolomic analysis, as it proved to be very effective in authenticity and quality control of dairy products, as well as to follow product evolution during processing and storage. The analytical assessment of the EU mountain denomination label, specifically for Parmigiano Reggiano “Prodotto di Montagna - Progetto Territorio” (Mountain-CQ) cheese, has received limited attention. Although it was established in 2012 the EU mountain denomination label has not been much studied from an analytical point of view. Nonetheless, tracing a specific profile for the mountain products is essential to support the value chain of this specialty. Results: The aim of the study was to produce an identity profile for Parmigiano Reggiano “Prodotto di Montagna - Progetto Territorio” (Mountain-CQ) cheese, and to differentiate it from Parmigiano Reggiano PDO samples (conventional-PDO) using 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate data analysis. Three different approaches were applied and compared. First, the spectra-as-such were analysed after proper preprocessing. For the other two approaches, Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) was used for signals resolution and features extraction, either individually on manually-defined spectral intervals or by reapplying MCR-ALS on the whole spectra with selectivity constraints using the reconstructed “pure profiles” as initial estimates and targets. All approaches provided comparable information regarding the samples’ distribution, as in all three cases the separation between the two product categories conventional-PDO and Mountain-CQ could be highlighted. Moreover, a novel MATLAB toolbox for features extraction via MCR-ALS was developed and used in synergy with the Chenomx library, allowing for a putative identification of the selected features. Significance: A first identity profile for Parmigiano Reggiano “Prodotto di Montagna - Progetto Territorio” obtained by interpreting the metabolites signals in NMR spectroscopy was obtained. Our workflow and toolbox for generating the features dataset allows a more straightforward interpretation of the results, to overcome the limitations due to dimensionality and to peaks overlapping, but also to include the signals assignment and matching since the early stages of the data processing and analysis. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major supply chain disruptions and unveiled the pressing need to improve supply chain resilience (SCRES). Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is a promising lever; however, its future in supply chain risk management (SCRM) is highly uncertain and largely unexplored. This paper aims to evaluate I4.0′s potential to improve SCRES in a post-COVID-19 world. Based on current literature and multiple workshops, 13 future projections on potential I4.0 application areas in SCRM were developed. A two-round Delphi study among 64 SCRM experts with digital expertise was conducted to evaluate and discuss the projections regarding their probability of occurrence until 2030, their impact on SCRES, and their desirability. A fuzzy c-means algorithm was applied to cluster the projections based on the expert assessments. The expert evaluations led to three clusters on I4.0 application in SCRM: Four projections on generating data, increasing visibility, and building digital capabilities received considerable approval and are reliable to improve SCRES in 2030. Four projections enabling data sharing and processing were predominantly supported and demonstrated realization potential for 2030. Finally, five projections that require major supply network adaptations were deemed unlikely to improve SCRES in 2030. This paper answers several research calls by presenting empirical evidence on the pathway of I4.0 implementation in SCRM following the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, it evaluates a holistic set of technologies and indicates prioritization potentials to achieve SCRES improvements. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the last few decades, there has been an increase in food safety and traceability issues. To prevent accidents and misconduct, it became essential to establish Food Safety Traceability System (FSTS) to trace the food from producer to consumer. The traceability systems can help track food in supply chains from farms to retail. Numerous technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), sensor networks, and data mining have been integrated into traditional food supply chain systems to remove unsafe food products from the chain. But, these are not adequate for the current supply chain market. The emerging technology of blockchain can overcome safety and tracking issues. This can be possible with the help of blockchain features like transparent, decentralized, distributed, and immutable. Most of the previous works missed the discussion of the systematic process and technology involved in implementing the FSTS using blockchain. In this paper, we have discussed an organized state of research of the existing FSTS using blockchain. This survey paper aims to outline a detailed analysis of blockchain technology, FSTS using blockchain, consensus algorithms, security attacks, and solutions. Several survey papers and solutions based on blockchain are included in this research paper.

We conduct a principal components analysis and a clustering analysis along six dimensions (GVC participation, GVC value capture, investment, socioeconomic development, domestic environmental impact and international environmental balance) for 133 countries between 1995 and 2015. We find three social, ecological, productive development and GVC insertion patterns: “curse of GVC marginalization”, “ecologically perverse upgrading” and “reproduction of the core”. While our results confirm the asymmetry in ecological degradation between high-income and low-income economies shown by EUE, it refines and nuances these findings. We argue that environmental asymmetries are driven in large part by differences in how countries articulate within GVCs. Countries with a higher capacity to capture value from GVC participation (“reproduction of the core”) are able to displace environmental impacts to countries facing a trade-off between upgrading in GVCs and ecological degradation (“ecologically perverse upgrading”). Marginalization from GVCs, mitigates the impact of ecologically unequal exchange but constitutes a barrier to socio-economic benefits. Moreover, the lack of diffusion of more ecologically-efficient processes through GVCs has a negative impact on domestic ecological degradation for countries of the “curse of GVC marginalization” group. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The purpose of this research is to identify the areas of interest, research topics, and application areas that reflect the research nature of digital transformation (DT), as well as the strategies, practices, and trends of DT. To accomplish this, the Latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm, a probabilistic topic modeling technique, was applied to 5350 peer-reviewed journal articles on DT published in the last ten years, from 2013 to 2022. The analysis resulted in the discovery of 34 topics. These topics were classified, and a systematic taxonomy for DT was presented, including four sub-categories: implementation, technology, process, and human. As a result of time-based trend analysis, “Sustainable Energy”, “DT in Health”, “E-Government”, “DT in Education”, and “Supply Chain” emerged as top topics with an increasing trend. Our findings indicate that research interests are focused on specific applications of digital transformation in industrial and public settings. Based on our findings, we anticipate that the next phase of DT research and practice will concentrate on specific DT applications in government, health, education, and economics. “Sustainable Energy” and “Supply Chain” have been identified as the most prominent topics in current DT processes and applications. This study can help researchers and practitioners in the field by providing insights and implications about the evolution and applications of DT. Our findings are intended to serve as a guide for DT in understanding current research gaps and potential future research topics. © 2023 by the authors.},

The goal of the proposed AFC-ETSAFDL technique is to recognize different types of fruits from the captured images. In the presented technique, a fusion-based feature extraction method is applied using three DL models namely, DenseNet, ResNet, and Inception v3 with ETSA as a hyperparameter optimizer. For fruit classification, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model is used in this study.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the knowledge trajectory and structure of the SCI field. Design/methodology/approach: Based on 3,533 papers extracted from the Web of Science (WoS), this paper adopts the main path analysis (MPA) method to detect three distinct knowledge development trajectories. Coupling-based clustering is combined with MPA to reveal three critical subfields. Findings: The findings show that the definition, content and dimensions of SCI lack unified conclusions. The influencing factors and performance consequences of SCI are long-standing research elements. Building theoretical models and integrated systems and applying blockchain technology to improve SCI are the key research contents. The intertwining of collaboration and SCI cannot be ignored, and the green SCI may be a hot topic in the future. Research limitations/implications: This study explores knowledge in the SCI field based on the limited literature collected by WoS rather than all published papers. The omissions of some relevant papers and books may exist. Practical implications: The study methodology provides a framework for similar studies in the future, and the results help researchers to get a comprehensive picture of the knowledge trajectory and structure of the SCI field. Originality/value: Compared to existing reviews, MPA combines cluster analysis to develop a synthetic framework of the knowledge trajectory and structure in the SCI domain. It contributes to a systematic review of the development of SCI. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Owing to the development of the technologies of Industry 4.0, recent years have witnessed the emergence of a new concept of supply chain management, namely Supply Chain 4.0 (SC 4.0). Huge investments in information technology have enabled manufacturers to trace the intangible flow of information, but instruments are required to take advantage of the available data sources: big data analytics (BDA) and machine learning (ML) represent important tools for this task. Use of advanced technologies can improve supply chain performances and support reaching strategic goals, but their implementation is challenging in supply chain management. The aim of this study was to understand the main benefits, challenges, and areas of application of BDA and ML in SC 4.0 as well as to understand the BDA and ML techniques most commonly used in the field, with a particular focus on nonparametric techniques. To this end, we carried out a literature review. From our analysis, we identified three main gaps, namely, the need for appropriate analytical tools to manage challenging data configurations; the need for a more reliable link with practice; the need for instruments to select the most suitable BDA or ML techniques. As a solution, we suggest and comment on two viable solutions: nonparametric statistics, and sentiment analysis and clustering. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Live streaming commerce (LSC) effectively combines the traditional real economy and e-commerce. Based on more than half a million unique GIS data values on LSC activities sourced via Taobao (Alibaba), we traced the spatial distribution of different players along the supply chain and further highlighted the intermediary role of streamers in developing the inter-regional industry. This study guides industrial planning in a diversified regional context, especially in economically peripheral regions. Our results show the following outcomes: (1) in contrast to dispersed suppliers, streamers and consumers are highly clustered. This trend proves that streamers are rooted in a specific urban context while playing the role of an intermediary in inter-regional supply chains, effectively extending geographic interactivity between suppliers and (potential) customers. (2) LSC primarily promotes regional light industry, especially in economically peripheral and rural areas, and provides opportunities for rapid development in cities with skilled handicraft providers. (3) China’s LSC streams have a pyramid structure, and the top group is highly clustered in metropolitan regions, such as the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD). This clustering makes it easier for streamers to work with large, well-known brands. The bottom group is mainly in charge of expanding the supply chain within the region and relies more on the local industrial base. It is diversified due to the different types of businesses or products. Ultimately, we draw attention to adaptive spatial planning and resource allocation in the context of the economic and geographic reforms brought by this growing industry, and discuss the policy implications based on the relationships between the supply of and demand for live streamers from a broader regional perspective. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, pure economic supply chain management is not commonly contemplated among companies (especially buyers), as recently novel dimensions of supply chains, e.g., environmental, sustainability, and risk, play significant roles. In addition, since companies prefer buying their needs from a group of suppliers, the problem of supplier selection is not solely choosing or qualifying a supplier from among others. Buyers, hence, commonly assemble a portfolio of suppliers by looking at the multi-dimensional pre-determined selection criteria. Since sustainable supplier selection criteria are often assessed by linguistic terms, an appropriate clustering approach is required. This paper presents an innovative way to implement fuzzy equivalence relation to clustering sustainable suppliers through developing a comprehensive taxonomy of sustainable supplier selection criteria, including supply chain risk. Fifteen experts participated in this study to evaluate 20 suppliers and cluster them in the plastics industry. Findings reveal that the best partitioning occurs when the suppliers are divided into two clusters, with 4 (20%) and 16 (80%) suppliers, respectively. The four suppliers in cluster one are performing better in terms of the capability of supplier/delivery, service, risk, and sustainability criteria such as environment protection/management, and green innovation. These factors are critical in clustering and selecting sustainable suppliers. The originality of this study lies in developing an all-inclusive set of criteria for clustering sustainable suppliers and adding risk factors to the conventional supplier selection criteria. In addition to partitioning the suppliers and determining the best-performing ones, this study also highlights the most influential factors by analysing the suppliers in the best cluster. © 2023 The Authors},

Yet, how to promote better supply lead time estimations that account for multivariate effects of historical supplier dynamics remains poorly understood. This paper proposes a decision support system that uses a supervised regression strategy with multivariate information for estimating supply lead times. We combine ideas from big data analytics and data mining to explore the effects of different supply-related variables on the dynamics of supply lead time. We design a robust rolling window evaluation scheme to compare both the statistical and inventory performance of different well-known data mining models. Numerical tests with empirical data from a large automotive manufacturer demonstrate that the Random Forest model consistently outperforms other competing models, leading to median decreases of 18%–24% in the mean absolute errors of supply lead time estimations. As a consequence of our results, we also provide insights on how these estimations contribute to the proactive management of safety stocks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Natural disasters are a part of human history worldwide. To mitigate after-disaster damages, it is imperative to create an effective disaster supply chain. This research proposes a stochastic multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model for an agile, flexible disaster supply chain network. Selecting domestic first-level suppliers and foreign second-level suppliers is a complicated process. We propose a novel group decision-making (GDM) framework that utilizes k-means clustering, the Borda count method, a consensus-reaching process, and the best-worst method. This framework results in the selection of qualified suppliers at the first and second levels. The GDM process utilizes agility indicators to reduce the delivery time of commodities. A robust probabilistic programming approach is used because of the uncertainty in some critical parameters in the crisis. To solve the large-scale problems, three well-known metaheuristic algorithms are employed. Metaheuristics parameters are then set to their optimum levels using the Taguchi method. Validations of the model and the solution methodologies used are based on a case study with twelve datasets. The obtained results indicate the applicability of both our group decision-making framework and the solution methodologies employed to solve the robust optimization model. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Here, we introduce the Malicious Source code Detection using a Translation model (MSDT) algorithm. MSDT is a novel deep-learning-based analysis method that detects real-world code injections into source code packages. We have tested MSDT by embedding examples from a dataset of over 600,000 different functions and then applying a clustering algorithm to the resulting embedding vectors to identify malicious functions by detecting outliers. We evaluated MSDT's performance with extensive experiments and demonstrated that MSDT could detect malicious code injections with precision@k values of up to 0.909. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Defect prevention and detection are very crucial for the quality improvement of additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Timely identification of imperfections and flaws in the manufactured products will allow effective and early implementation of corrective actions and thus impede the spread of defects to the whole industrial value chain. In laser metal deposition (LMD) AM processes, defects are imperfections which typically include “porosity” and “cracks formation”. This study presents novel data-driven anomaly detection techniques that use both transfer learning and online learning to assess the quality of melt pool images taken during the LMD process of a part. The proposed methods incorporate the characteristics and dynamics of the manufactured part during the printing process along with previous knowledge acquired from historical data. Continual online learning models (K-means and self-organizing maps) are developed whose parameters are adapted to the incoming data collected in real-time as a new part is being manufactured. The proposed models significantly outperformed the performance of their batch-learning counterparts in detecting anomalous melt pool images in an additively manufactured Ti–6Al–4V thin-walled part. Both models required an average of ∼0.07 s to process each incoming melt pool image, update their parameters and give a prediction on the image's health. This shows the potential of continual online learning for real-time anomaly detection. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

To maximize the benefits of this technology, investors and logistics managers need information on target commodities, service location establishment, and the distribution of origin–destination pairs within EAA’s range limitations. This research introduces a three-phase data-mining and geographic information system (GIS) algorithm to support data-driven decision-making under uncertainty. Analysts can modify and expand this workflow to scrutinize origin–destination commodity flow datasets representing various locations. The algorithm identifies four commodity categories contributing to more than one-third of the value transported by aircraft across the contiguous United States, yet only 5% of the weight. The workflow highlights 8 out of 129 regional locations that moved more than 20% of the weight of those four commodity categories. A distance band of 400 miles among these eight locations accounts for more than 80% of the transported weight. This study addresses a literature gap, identifying opportunities for supply chain redesign using EAA. The presented methodology can guide planners and investors in identifying prime target markets for emerging EAA technologies using regional datasets. © 2023 by the author.},

	abstract = {Blockchain is a significant advancement in technology recently, transforming the traditional centralized system into a decentralized one. Smart contracts, as one of the best applications of blockchain, show great potential in various fields, such as finance, supply chain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). As the world's first blockchain platform to support turing complete smart contracts, Ethereum has become the most critical infrastructure for the digital world. However, with the vigorous development of smart contracts, malicious attacks against smart contracts have frequently occurred in recent years. The issue of smart contract security has attracted widespread attention due to the huge financial losses caused by smart contract vulnerabilities. Although researchers have made some progress in detecting smart contract vulnerabilities through symbolic execution and fuzzing-based methods, existing methods mainly rely on expert knowledge and hand-crafted features, leading to many detection errors. Even worse, existing methods take tens of seconds or even minutes to detect each smart contract on average, which is extremely time-consuming. In this work, we present SVScanner, the new method combining two features of heterogeneous patterns to detect smart contract vulnerabilities in the blockchain. Specifically, we first extract global semantic features from the sequence of contract code tokens. Then we further use the attention mechanism to capture deep structural semantics from the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of smart contracts. Finally, we combine these two features from different patterns and use a text convolutional neural network (TextCNN) to detect contract bugs. Experimental results show that SVScanner has the ability to detect vulnerabilities effectively in real-world smart contract datasets. SVScanner achieves a 7.33% improvement in accuracy compared with other traditional methods. Moreover, our method requires significantly less detection time. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As the fusion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology advances, it is increasingly shaping diverse fields. The potential of this convergence to fortify security, enhance privacy, and streamline operations has ignited considerable academic interest, resulting in an impressive body of literature. However, there is a noticeable scarcity of studies employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to dissect and categorize this field. This review paper endeavours to bridge this gap by meticulously analysing a dataset of 4455 journal articles drawn solely from the Scopus database, cantered around IoT and blockchain applications. Utilizing LDA, we have extracted 14 distinct topics from the collection, offering a broad view of the research themes in this interdisciplinary domain. Our exploration underscores an upswing in research pertaining to IoT and blockchain, emphasizing the rising prominence of this technological amalgamation. Among the most recurrent themes are IoT and blockchain integration in supply chain management and blockchain in healthcare data management and security, indicating the significant potential of this convergence to transform supply chains and secure healthcare data. Meanwhile, the less frequently discussed topics include access control and management in blockchain-based IoT systems and energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks using blockchain and IoT. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to apply LDA in the context of IoT and blockchain research, providing unique perspectives on the existing literature. Moreover, our findings pave the way for proposed future research directions, stimulating further investigation into the less explored aspects and sustaining the growth of this dynamic field. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Ports are both the start and end points of shipping, they are connected by shipping routes, thereby forming a port shipping network that connects global industries and supply chains. Each port node has specific functions within the network, while its capacity to resist interference differs from that of other ports; consequently, when encountering external shocks, ports are not affected equally. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of port node resilience from the perspective of the shipping network. This is achieved by analyzing the literature on regional, urban, and network resilience. Thereafter, by fully considering the complexity of port nodes' linkages, as well as their attributes vis-à-vis the shipping network, a three-dimensional (structure, function, and location) econometric model of port-node resilience is constructed. By examining data from China's container ports for the years 2008 and 2018, this study analyzes port nodes' resilience characteristics and the differences in space. The results indicate that the studied port nodes' resilience index presents the characteristic of clustering. Further, the average resilience index increased from 0.25 (low) to 0.43 (medium). The differences in port nodes' regional resilience narrowed, while their absorption and transformation capacity improved when facing external interference. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: Lean practices are identified from the literature. Then, two hierarchical models were are developed using two distinct modeling approaches – ISM and IRP with expert opinions from an Indian automotive component manufacturing organization to analyze the contextual relationships among the various lean practices and to prioritize and rank them with respect to performance dimensions. Findings: In the study, the hierarchical structural models are developed using ISM and IRP approaches for an Indian automotive component manufacturing organization. In ISM-based modeling, lean practices can be categorized into five levels. Top priority should be given to the motivators followed by value chain, system/technology and organization centric practices. IRP model shows the dominance relationship among the various lean practices with respect to performance dimensions. Practical implications: The models are constructed from the organizational standpoint to evaluate their impact to the implementation of lean manufacturing. The study leverages the organizations to prioritize limited resources as per the hierarchy. Managers get the inter-linkages and ranking of various lean practices, which leads to a better perspective for the effective implementation of lean. The structural models also assist management to assign proper roles to employees/departments for effective lean implementation. Originality/value: There is hardly any structural model of lean practices in the literature for clustering, prioritizing and ranking of lean practices. The study fills this gap and develops the hierarchical models of lean practices through IRP and ISM approaches for an Indian automotive component manufacturing organization.

This study aims to map the intellectual structure and evolution of the conceptual structure of overall AI research published in Technological Forecasting and Social Change (TF&SC). This study uses machine learning-based structural topic modeling (STM) to extract, report, and visualize the latent topics from the AI research literature. Further, the disciplinary patterns in the intellectual structure of AI research are examined with the additional objective of assessing the disciplinary impact of AI. The results of the topic modeling reveal eight key topics, out of which the topics concerning healthcare, circular economy and sustainable supply chain, adoption of AI by consumers, and AI for decision-making are showing a rising trend over the years. AI research has a significant influence on disciplines such as business, management, and accounting, social science, engineering, computer science, and mathematics. The study provides an insightful agenda for the future based on evidence-based research directions that would benefit future AI scholars to identify contemporary research issues and develop impactful research to solve complex societal problems. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Meanwhile, using different techniques and software and completing the experiences of past researches have increased the speed, accuracy, and practicality of the relevant reports. In this study, the tire industry has been investigated with regard to its prominent role in the future automobile and transportation industry. All tire-related patent certificates in the last 20 years were extracted from the Derwent Innovation Index database using a search string and IPC codes, and with the help of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which is an unsupervised machine learning method, the relevant technology areas were extracted. The analysis of technologies and forecasting future technology areas were conducted regarding the share and growth rate of each technology in two 10-year periods (2000–2009 and 2010–2019) and the study of trends and technical indicators related to the industry and value chain. The analysis of nine technology areas considered by tire industry innovators during the last 20 years, as well as the analysis of trends and effective factors on these technologies indicated that the fields of airless tires and intelligent tires technology areas would be highly welcomed in the future and become the dominant and extensively-used technologies of the tire industry in the future. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The importance of civil engineering infrastructure in modern societies has increased lately due to the growth of the global economy. It forges global supply chains facilitating enormous economic activity. The bridges usually form critical links in complex supply chain networks. Structural health monitoring (SHM) of these infrastructures is essential to reduce life-cycle costs, and determine their remaining life using advanced sensing techniques and data fusion methods. However, the data obtained from the SHM systems describing the health condition of the infrastructure systems may contain anomalies (i.e., distortion, drift, bias, outlier, noise etc.). An automated framework is required to accurately classify these anomalies and evaluate the current condition of these systems in a timely and cost-effective manner. In this paper, a recursive and interpretable decision tree framework is proposed to perform multiclass classification of acceleration data collected from a real-life bridge. The decision nodes of the decision tree are random forest classifiers that are invoked recursively after synthetically augmenting the training data before successive iterations until suitable classification performance is obtained. This machine-learning-based classification model evolved from a simplistic decision tree where statistical features are used to perform classification. The feature vectors defined for training the random forest classifiers are calculated using similar statistical features that are easy to interpret, enhancing the interpretability of the classifier models. The proposed framework could classify non-anomalous (i.e., normal) time-series of the test dataset with 98% accuracy. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to provide an improvement in the modeling of supply chain designs by incorporating correlated uncertainty among multiple parameters, resulting in a more resilient design. A new methodology to generate forecasts for historically correlated time series, regardless of their underlying probability distributions, is presented and applied to generate scenarios for energy and carbon prices, which historically proved to be correlated. These scenarios are then used in a stochastic computation to obtain a three-echelon supply chain design in Europe maximizing the economic performance. The emissions were monetarized through the incorporation of the European Union cap-and-trade emissions trading system into the model. The social impact of the supply chain network is measured in terms of the direct, indirect and induced jobs it creates, which are proportional to the economic performance. By combining the developed methodology with data mining algorithms, a reduction in the number of required scenarios by more than 90% was achieved. The numerical case study moreover shows that the stochastic design ensures an average reduction of emissions by more than 3 ktons compared to the use of a deterministic approach. In comparison, the computation of a stochastic supply chain design without parameter correlation takes 5 times longer. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Supply Chain Management Systems (SCM) is the critical infrastructure that can be treated as a significant factor since it forms advancement in intelligent devices. The cyber-attacks against SCM are increasing day by day, and detecting these cyber-related attacks remains a challenging task. In general, deep learning algorithms are superior in handling complex datasets than machine learning approaches because of their layered structure and practical algorithms to extract the relevant information from the input training data. Deep Learning (DL) methodologies are rapidly being utilized to counter cyber-attacks on Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems. This research proposes a new method that leverages evolutionary and DL approaches to detect cyber-attacks in a cloud-based SCM environment. The input data undergoes preprocessing to convert it to a suitable format. To reduce the complexity of high dimensional data and select the most relevant features, Evolution Social Spider Optimization (ESSO) is employed. A Deep Belief Network (DBM) trained by an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is then introduced to identify and classify cyber-attacks. The performance of the proposed network is improved through fine-tuning using Poor and Rich Optimization (PRO) algorithms. The proposed PRO-optimized ELM-trained DBM model aims to enhance security in the SCM environment by recognizing and classifying intrusions. The performance of the proposed model is experimented on benchmark datasets and compared with traditional approaches. The depicted results based on various measures show that the proposed ELMDBN-PRO in Blockchain of Things-Internet of Things (BoT-IoT) dataset achieves an average accuracy of 99%, mod bus dataset achieves 99.5% over recent approaches. © 2023},

However, designers find it challenging to recognize customers’ motivations and emotions towards their preferred fit and define ease allowances in the virtual environment. This study investigates the variations of ease preferences for apparel sizes with body dimensions and psychological orientations by developing a virtual garment fitting prediction model. An artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to develop the model. The ANN model was proved to be effective in predicting ease preferences from two major components. A non-linear relationship was modeled among pattern parameters, body dimensions, and psychographic characteristics. Also, to visualize the fitted bodies, a generative adversarial network (GAN) was applied to generate 3D samples with the predicted pattern parameters from the ANN model. This project promotes mass customization using psychographic orientations and provides the perfect fit to the end users. New size-fitting data is generated for improved ease preference charts, and it enhances end-user satisfaction with garment fit. © 2023 The Authors},

The first part of the analysis analyzed publication activity and listed all high impact journals covering the topic. Geographical distribution of findings showed that developed countries are the most productive in the field, in addition to an increasing interest from developing countries over the last decade. Keyword analysis generated from Vosviewer yielded to four main clusters covering the topic and shaping the intellectual structure of the study: (1) sustainable development & supply chain management, (2) environmental impact of procurement, (3) lifecycle analysis, (4) social responsibility and ethical sourcing.

It is mainly driven by blockchain, semantic communication, edge computing, and artificial intelligence, which can construct value networks to achieve participatory economics based on participatory decision making. Web 3.0 can capture the characteristics of blockchain, semantic extraction, and communication to achieve decentralized semantic sharing and transfer information precisely. However, current Web 3.0 solutions focus on the blockchain while overlooking other new technologies' roles in Web 3.0. To further unleash the advantages of semantic extraction and communication in Web 3.0, in this article, we propose a blockchain-based semantic exchange framework to realize fair and efficient interactions. In this framework, we first attempt to tokenize semantic information into Non-Fungible Token (NFT) for semantic exchange. Then we utilize a Stackelberg game to maximize buying and pricing strategies for semantic trading. We also leverage Zero-Knowledge Proof to share authentic semantic information without publishing it before receiving payments, which can achieve a fair and privacy-preserving trading compared with current NFT marketplaces. A case study about urban planning is given to show clearly the proposed mechanisms. Finally, several challenges and opportunities are identified.  © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

The objective of this study was to develop a non-destructive detection system to determine the glyphosate content in 6 pulses (chickpea, yellow pea, red lentil, large green lentil, French green lentil, and black beluga lentil) based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Organically grown pulses were artificially spiked with glyphosate at 5 concentrations (0 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) and used for the development and testing of FTIR spectroscopy and associated chemometric models. Principal component analysis (PCA) led to the discrimination and clustering in the pulse samples based on the applied glyphosate levels. Various preprocessing and variable selection techniques were applied on the spectral dataset and partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to predict the glyphosate levels in pulses. The correlation coefficient for prediction (Rp2) of glyphosate was 0.93, 0.92, 0.96, 0.91, 0.96, and 0.92 for yellow pea, chickpea, large green lentil, red lentil, black beluga, and French green lentil, respectively with optimized preprocessing and variable selection techniques. © 2023, Bundesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL).},

Great potential is attributed to machine learning in industrial risk assessment as a promising technology in the fields of computer science and the internet. To better understand the role of machine learning in this field and to investigate the current research status, we selected 3116 papers from the SCIE and SSCI databases of the WOS retrieval platform between 1991 and 2022 as our data sample. The VOSviewer, Bibliometrix R, and CiteSpace software were used to perform co-occurrence analysis, clustering analysis, and dual-map overlay analysis of keywords. The results indicate that the development trend of machine learning in industrial risk assessment can be divided into three stages: initial exploration, stable development, and high-speed development. Machine learning algorithm design, applications in biomedicine, risk monitoring in construction and machinery, and environmental protection are the knowledge base of this study. There are three research hotspots in the application of machine learning to industrial risk assessment: the study of machine learning algorithms, the risk assessment of machine learning in the Industry 4.0 system, and the application of machine learning in autonomous driving. At present, the basic theories and structural systems related to this research have been established, and there are numerous research directions and extensive frontier branches. “Random Forest”, “Industry 4.0”, “supply chain risk assessment”, and “Internet of Things” are at the forefront of the research. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Water distribution networks (WDNs) in urban areas are predominantly underground for seamless freshwater transmission. As a result, monitoring their health is often complicated, requiring expensive equipment and methodologies. This study proposes a low-cost approach to locating leakages in WDNs in an urban setting, leveraging acoustic signal behavior and machine learning. An inexpensive noise logger was used to collect acoustic signals from the water mains. The signals underwent empirical mode decomposition, feature extraction, and denoising to separate pure leak signals from background noises. Two regression machine learning algorithms, support vector machines (SVM) and ensemble k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), were then employed to predict the leak’s location using the features as input. The SVM achieved a validation accuracy of 82.50%, while the k-NN achieved 83.75%. Since the study proposes using single noise loggers, classification k-NN and decision trees (DTs) were used to predict the leak’s direction. The k-NN performed better than the DT, with a validation accuracy of 97.50%, while the latter achieved 78.75%. The models are able to predict leak locations in water mains in urban settings, as the study was conducted in a similar setting. © 2023 by the authors.},

Smart cities, where digital technologies are concentrated and implemented, face new challenges in becoming sustainable from social, ecological, and economic perspectives. Using text mining methodologies of topic modeling and network analysis, this study aims to identify keywords in the field of smart cities after the pandemic and provide a future-oriented perspective on the direction of smart cities. A corpus of 1882 papers was collected from the Web of Science and Scopus databases from December 2019 to November 2022. We identified six categories of potential issues in smart cities using topic modeling: “supply chain”, “resilience”, “culture and tourism”, “population density”, “mobility”, and “zero carbon emission”. This study differs from previous research because it is a quantitative study based on text mining analysis and deals with smart cities, given the prevalence of COVID-19. This study also provides insights into the development of smart city policies and strategies to improve urban resilience during the pandemic by anticipating and addressing related issues. The findings of this study will assist researchers, policymakers, and planners in developing smart city strategies and decision-making in socioeconomic, environmental, and technological areas. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Private households are an important group of energy consumers. Based on Eurostat data, their energy consumption constituted 30% of the final consumption of energy use across the European Union in 2021. The cost of energy is one of the main components of household budgets; thus, the prices provided by energy carriers have a significant impact on energy consumption. The price offered to the final consumer consists of three components: the price of energy and its supply, network costs, and taxes and levies. The values of the three components, however, depend on several factors, among which the structure of the energy markets and energy policies in individual EU countries play a key role. This work aimed to analyze and assess the structure of electricity prices offered to households across EU countries in the years 2019–2021. The differences and similarities between the pricing policies of selected products in the EU and their impacts on households’ purchasing capacity were captured and a non-pattern classification method (k-means) was applied as a research tool. The results indicated that the heterogeneity of the electricity price structure increased significantly over the period analyzed. This may be a consequence of the use of strongly differentiated tools to mitigate electricity price increases and the steps being taken towards low-carbon economies. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As industrial production outsourcing expands, the collaboration relationship of firms evolves to be more entangled, which means that the enterprise communities in the supply chain network become increasingly overlapping and their boundaries are ambiguous. Given the network complexity, deeper insight into the sequencing orders of suppliers and assemblers is required to orchestrate the supply chain partner collaboration. Considering the overlapping community and multi-layered connectivity characteristics of the supply chain network, in this paper, we design a gravitation-based hierarchical community detection algorithm for structuring the supply chain network. The solution applies a functional modules identification strategy based on node gravitation and a hierarchical clustering strategy based on module gravitation to structure the supply chain network architecture. The key technique is to investigate the global gravitational influence of focal firms, segment the functional modules by characterizing the overlapping conditions among communities, and construct the dendrogram by measuring the gravitational forces between modules in order to map the hierarchical architecture of the dendrogram to structure the supply chain network. The proposed algorithm does not necessitate a prior knowledge about the network. It is adaptable to construct the supply chain network that exhibits scale-free, highly overlapped modular community, and hierarchical characteristics. Experimental results on synthetic benchmark and real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the importance of effective vaccine supply chain management (SCM). As the world raced to curb the spread of the virus, the efficient distribution of vaccines became crucial to ending the pandemic. However, the challenges of distributing COVID-19 vaccines globally were exacerbated by the pandemic itself, leading to delays, shortages, and disruptions under disaster conditions. In this study, we use social media analytics to explore the impact of COVID-19 vaccine supply chain challenges from a global perspective. We collected data from two social media platforms—Twitter and the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT)—between January 2020 and November 2022. The analysis is developed leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as topic modelling and sentiment analysis. We found that vaccine supply chain challenges significantly impacted the ability of healthcare systems to respond to the pandemic, with significant differences between regions (such as in the case of developing countries). Our findings highlight the need for improved coordination and collaboration in vaccine SCM to ensure equitable access. In addition, this research provides valuable practical insight into using social media analytics and its potential to enhance decision-making capabilities for policymakers and industry leaders. © 2023 The Author(s)},

As the most important transportation mode in the high-speed transportation systems, airports are playing an increasingly important role in promoting regional economic development, yielding a number of airport economic promotion areas. To boost effective development management of these areas, accurate risk assessment through data analysis is quite important. Thus in this paper, the idea of ensemble learning is utilized to propose a big data-driven assessment model for supply chains in airport economic promotion areas. In particular, we combine two aspects of data from different sources: (1) national economic statistics and enterprise registration data from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce; (2) data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China and other multi-source data. On this basis, an integrated ensemble learning method is constructed to quantitatively analyze the supply chain security characteristics in domestic airport economic area, providing important support for the security of supply chains in airport economic area. Finally, some experiments are conducted on synthetic data to evaluate the method investigated in this paper, which has proved its efficiency and practice.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

This research also assesses the value of the data extracted from social media. Methodology: This study extracted data from Twitter and combines the power of an effective software (Python) with expert analysis (Delphi study in three rounds) to identify the key issues in pharmaceutical industry that have been neglected by decision makers. Furthermore, combination of the two powerful tools (Python and Delphi) is another merit of this work since it is a sophisticated method. Findings: This research has recognized that there are four major key problems that are highly critical and need urgent attention and proposes the key resolutions to these issues. The expert panel believed that the results from Twitter data are very helpful and gives decision makers new insight into pharmaceutical supply chain. Originality: Several items gathered this study make it unique. First, by using social media, this paper has discovered the underlying problems of PSC that are not usually detected by PSC management systems or are being neglected by them. Second, through a Delphi study, this research discovered the patterns of these issues and mechanisms by which they are formed and also provided new effective solutions. Many other papers have just stated that social media is useful for supply chains, but the vast majority of them did not actually conduct an in-depth analysis on social media to discover problems in pharmaceutical supply chain, and very few studies explored the mechanisms by which those problems were formed. © 2023},

This paper aims to systematically review and analyze recent research on the VRP by covering 89 papers between 2001 and 2022. The focus of this study is on the new and emerging topics existing in the VRP, including feeder VRP (FVRP), real-time VRP (RTVRP), and collaborative VRP (CVRP) for urban transportation. To this end, recent findings are reviewed to recognize novel research gaps for the problem. Based on reviews, we suggest applying multi-agent solving approaches and novel metaheuristic algorithms in the FVRP. Furthermore, studying the real-time methodology in various routing problems such as electric VRP (EVRP), two-echelon VRP (2E-VRP), rich VRP (RVRP), agro-food supply chains, biomass supply chain, and healthcare supply chains are other suggestions of this research.

	abstract = {Improving the flexibility and capabilities of pharmaceutical technologies and lowering the process development time while satisfying regulatory constraints translate to highly desired resilient supply chains. Generating and validating the necessary knowledge in-silico before experimentation or plant-scale intervention with minimized human implications is the dream this paper aims to contribute to. The idea is demonstrated through the case study of particle size-controlled second-order asymmetric transformation of enantiomers (SOAT), a crystallization and racemization-based resolution technique. The fundamental processes form a complex network, to which we propose a crystallization-integrated wet milling system, which is promising but has limited general, and no SOAT-specific operation experience. The developed computational framework has three steps: (1) skilled scientists draft potential technologies to solve a well-defined problem; (2) all alternatives are modeled with high fidelity first-principle models, followed by high throughput parametric optimizations (3) data mining is deployed to extract key information from the synthetic database of optimal solutions and take the effectiveness of process design and operation to the next level. In this work, population balance-based models were applied to describe the crystallization, fragmentation, and chemical reaction in the crystallizer and wet mill. The efficient implementation enabled the execution of nearly 1300 global multiobjective process optimizations. Carefully trained classifiers consistently predicted the with or without milling and with or without T-cycling decisions (AUC score exceeding 0.85). Regression methods estimated the product property profile with Pearson coefficients over 0.95.

	abstract = {This paper analyses the transferability of freight generation (FG) models to provide guidance on the direction of transfer, the degree of transfer, and how to determine the sample size required for new regions. A set of FG models are developed for four regions in India, i.e., Hyderabad, Jaipur, North Kerala, and Central Kerala. Models are assessed for naïve transferability across these regions to know the direction and degree of transfer. Using multidimensionality scaling, we identified new regions similar to the study regions based on geographical characteristics like population density, number of establishments, land value, road density, and seaport proximity. The identical regions are further grouped into four different clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm. In order to determine the sample size of a new region, the transferability results are interpolated to these geographically linked regions with the same demographics. This research is crucial for saving survey resources in terms of money and time. The policymakers and stakeholders can borrow the strategies already under implementation in a region with topographic similarity with the novel methodology proposed. Furthermore, industrialists can take the case study of the establishments in geographically similar regions in strategizing the resource and capacity allocation for efficient and responsive supply chain design. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Supply chain responsiveness and Big Data Analytics (BDA) have incited an ample amount of interest in academia and among practitioners. This work is concerned with improving responsiveness in supply chain networks by extending production capacity to cope with changes and variations in demand. BDA helps researchers make sense of the current challenges of data: high volume, high velocity, and high variety. In this work, we will look at sales data and at large warehouses, which envelop all the said three characteristics of Big Data (BD). This is quite important as demand market data is increasingly shared with supply chain managers. Here, a working architecture is introduced to handle the challenges of BD. The work uses a neural network to detect patterns within the demand. The work combines deep learning with nonlinear programming to enable flexibility at supply chain production facilities to respond to the forecasted demand. The parameters in the neural network are analyzed and studied for each different product type. We see significant prediction improvements when the parameters are better tuned. Further, the work introduces a BD architecture that automates the acquisition of the data, data mining, and the storage of input and output files. Overall, the work utilizes a gradient search method, a genetic algorithm, ARIMA, a deep learning algorithm, and a mixed-integer nonlinear program. © 2023},

	abstract = {Understanding consumers' preferences has always been important for economic theory and for business practitioners in operations management, supply chain management, marketing, etc. While preferences are often considered stable in simplified theoretical modelling, this is not the case in real-world decision-making. Therefore, it is crucial to understand consumers' preferences when a market disruption occurs. This research aims to recognise consumers' preferences with respect to online shopping after the COVID-19 outbreak hit markets. To this purpose, we conducted an empirical study among Croatian consumers with prior experience in online shopping using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 350 respondents who met the criteria. We selected decision-tree models using the J48 algorithm to determine the influences of the found shopping factors and demographic characteristics on a consumer's preference indicator. The main components of our indicators that influence consumer behaviour are the stimulators and destimulators of online shopping and the importance of social incidence. Our results show significant differences between men and women, with men tending to use fewer variables to make decisions. In addition, the analysis revealed that four product groups and a range of shopping mode-specific influencing factors are required to evaluate consumers' purchase points when constructing the consumers 'preference indicator. © 2023 All rights reserved},

	abstract = {Last-mile delivery has several negative environmental impacts in urban areas because of its high levels of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, as well as traffic congestion. These issues motivate decision-makers to redesign the delivery networks and make them more sustainable and efficient. A well-planned territory design can reduce total travel times and distances in urban distribution systems, in addition to balancing the workload between drivers. In this study, a two-echelon parcel distribution network modeled as the two-echelon vehicle routing problem with territory design and satellite location decisions is considered. A three-stage decomposition algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. In the first stage, a non-supervised machine learning clustering method is applied, followed by an algorithm based on the nearest-neighbor routing procedure, to find a set of routes for the second and first echelons. An improvement heuristic was also applied to improve the results in terms of the second echelon routing, considering the computational complexity of a large-scale instance. A case study based on real data from a delivery company in the city of Paris, France is adopted to perform the experiments. The outcomes of this paper show an improvement of 22.6% in travel time and distance. This reduction is also assessed with performance indicators like land use, fixed costs, energy consumption, carbon dioxide equivalent, and fine particles emissions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As an abrupt epidemic occurs, healthcare systems are shocked by the surge in the number of susceptible patients' demands, and decision-makers mostly rely on their frame of reference for urgent decision-making. Many reports have declared the COVID-19 impediments to trading and global economic growth. This study aims to provide a mathematical model to support pharmaceutical supply chain planning during the COVID-19 epidemic. Additionally, it aims to offer new insights into hospital supply chain problems by unifying cold and non-cold chains and considering a wide range of pharmaceuticals and vaccines. This approach is unprecedented and includes an analysis of various pharmaceutical features such as temperature, shelf life, priority, and clustering. To propose a model for planning the pharmaceutical supply chains, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is used for a four-echelon supply chain design. This model aims to minimize the costs involved in the pharmaceutical supply chain by maintaining an acceptable service level. Also, this paper considers uncertainty as an intrinsic part of the problem and addresses it through the wait-and-see method. Furthermore, an unexplored unsupervised learning method in the realm of supply chain planning has been used to cluster the pharmaceuticals and the vaccines and its merits and drawbacks are proposed. A case of Tehran hospitals with real data has been used to show the model's capabilities, as well. Based on the obtained results, the proposed approach is able to reach the optimum service level in the COVID conditions while maintaining a reduced cost. The experiment illustrates that the hospitals' adjacency and emergency orders alleviated the service level significantly. The proposed MILP model has proven to be efficient in providing a practical intuition for decision-makers. The clustering technique reduced the size of the problem and the time required to solve the model considerably. © 2023 The Authors},

To understand the social implications of the implementation of the CE, a semi-systematic literature review was completed evaluating the variables of equity, diversity, collaboration, quality of life, maturity, and governance as derived from a capabilities approach. At a societal level, this article explores the main demands and contributions of the CE to society and identifies the inconsistencies in the literature in assessing the CE as a strategy for development, counterposing views of the CE's contribution to the socioeconomic system. Furthermore, the analysis proposes a set of socioeconomic strategies that can aid a CE implementation.

Furthermore, we include nuances to the 9Rs, adding regeneration. The qualitative assessment combined with a topic model offered specific areas where the social dimensions can be prioritized; these include food systems, the built environment with localized urban sharing, value chains, bioeconomy and mitigating the environmental impact of industries such as fashion and construction. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Misinformation or fake news has had multifaceted ramifications with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, creating widespread panic amongst people. This study investigates the impact of misinformation/ fake news (on internet platforms) on consumer buying behavior, impact of fear (created by fake news) on hoarding of essential products and consumer spending and finally impact of misinformation-induced panic buying on supply chain disruptions. It draws upon the consumer decision theory and the cognitive load theory for explaining the psychological and behavioral responses of consumers. The study follows an inductive approach towards theory building using a multi-method approach. Initially, a qualitative research method based on interviews followed by text-mining has been used followed by analysis using python for topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The findings revealed several prominent themes like consumer shift to online buying, two contrasting spending intentions namely financial security and compensatory consumptions, irrational panic buying, uncertainty/ambiguity of government protocol and norms, social media fraudulent practices and misinformation dissemination, personalized buying experience, reduced trust on news and marketers, logistics and transportation bottlenecks, labor shortage due to migration and plant closures, and bullwhip effect in supply chains. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The Farmer Producer Company (FPC), a subset of the Farmer Producer Organization (FPO), is an important institutional form designed to organize farmer groups towards better coordinated farming and marketing. In the Indian context, as FPCs have emerged as new forms of members-led agribusiness, their ability to identify prevailing social ties and tap them effectively towards business growth needs to be better understood. Although social capital is studied broadly for its potential to drive organizational performance, it has been poorly researched in farmer collectives such as FPCs. The current work examines the effect of social capital on benefits and business performance at the level of member groups in FPCs. An empirical analysis was conducted in which two FPCs, which differed significantly in their mobilization strategies, farming methods, and supply chain linkages, were surveyed. Data collected from the surveys were visualized and clustering analysis was carried out using Self Organizing Maps (SOM), an unsupervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN) tool. Insights from clustering reveal the importance of pre-existing social ties, leadership, participation in group activities and the geographical affinity of groups in benefits realization and business performance of FPCs. The importance of bottom-up approaches in establishing robust supply chain linkages in emerging FPCs was keyed out through this work. The inferences through SOM, distilled strategies for FPCs' stakeholders in prioritizing interventions for member groups and in generating broader implications for policy makers accounting social capital in new institutional models. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The ability to accelerate the discovery of product innovation ideas is critical for manufacturers with short life cycles, such as smartphones. Companies with short product lifespans require innovative strategies to improve their products based on customer needs. Three-dimensional concurrent engineering (3DCE) has the potential to speed up the process of developing new products. On the other side, the availability of online data, such as social media and intellectual property, has the potential to identify and prioritize product, technology, and supplier opportunities in a cost-effective, quick, and real-time manner. This study proposes an online data-driven concurrent product, process, and supply chain design (3DCE) for linking customer requirements to potential technology and supplier opportunities in early-stage new product development. Three case studies on the leading smartphone industry demonstrate the proposed method's feasibility and effectiveness. To identify customer requirements, opinions from social media data are collected. Product opportunities are developed using latent Dirichlet allocation to identify product topics and sentiment analysis to assess satisfaction levels. Then, a novel approach by association rule mining is developed to mine specific customer requirements for each promising topic. In the 3DCE approach, the potential technology and supplier opportunities are tailored to specific customer requirements based on intellectual property mining. Finally, this study discovers improvement ideas and potential alternative solutions for product development with an unsupervised approach. The proposed method has also been validated and aligns with successful innovation products by Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The transition towards a circular economy (CE) has grown in importance during the last decade, and ports are now being viewed as potentially important contributors to this move towards a more sustainable economy. However, several research questions about adopting CE projects in ports remain unanswered. The importance of clustering and secondary resources for circular loops indicates the importance of proximity to either industrial clusters or urban zones. However, gateway ports (GWP), contrary to industrial ports, metropolitan (or urban) ports and diversified port hubs (which combine an industrial function with the proximity to a large urban area), do not benefit from the vicinity of these secondary resources. Nevertheless, even without access to such secondary resources, any port and port managing body (PMB) needs to prepare for the changing competitive landscape, with new cargo flows, material streams and related businesses linked to the circular economy transition of value chains. Here, GWPs, thanks to their nodal position, still have potential to function as platforms for circular transition initiatives arising in other industries. In the present study, we conceptualize a CE transition process, consisting of six steps, especially relevant to GWPs. We then explore the case of the Port of Zeebrugge (Belgium), shortly before its merger with the Port of Antwerp. We propose that GWPs should rely mainly on their potential to attract ‘new value streams’ as the main driver of their CE strategy. Here, top-down initiatives emanating from internal stakeholders, and likely even external ones, appear to provide pathways to CE success. © 2023},

	abstract = {Global productivity growth has either stagnated or declined, despite continued technological innovations with the rise of knowledge-intensive intangibles that arise from the growth of knowledge stock (R&D activities). Understanding the root causes of this paradox in the context of growing economies requires an investigation of whether local knowledge diffusion can explain firm-level productivity differences, including key constraining factors like sources of financing or corporate governance structure. Using financial data of 7970 Indian firms over a 20-year period and clustering firms across industries, we assess the impact of R&D stock that is external to the firm through estimating both within (intra) and between (inter) industry spillovers. We find that both R&D and non-R&D-performing firms benefit from ‘between industry’ spillovers. We further show that firms with better access to finance achieve higher productivity, not only through their own R&D capital stock but also via both types of industry-level knowledge spillover. We allow for the two key sources of international spillovers namely import intensity and FDI. While import-intensive firms experience lower productivity, FDI mitigates this adverse productivity effect across knowledge-intensive exporting firms. The paper concludes that financially unconstrained firms and firms with greater corporate board connectedness derive positive industry-level spillover effects, reflecting intra- and inter-industry as domestic spillover or local value-chain effect in the literature on technological innovation. © 2023 The Authors},

Compact camera modules are used to demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of this methodology. This methodology can be divided into two parts. First, the K-means clustering method is applied to conduct a picking-list consolidation analysis to create an optimal picking-list consolidation strategy for sustainable warehouse operations. Second, the most similar picking lists in each cluster are connected using Prim’s minimum spanning tree algorithm to generate the connected graph with the minimum spanning tree so as to establish a picking-list assignment strategy for sustainable warehouse operations.

Although process mining is growing fast and it has already become the basis for a plethora of commercial tools, research has not yet sufficiently addressed the privacy concerns in this discipline. Most of the contributions made to privacy-preserving process mining consider an intra-organizational setting, where a single organization wants to safely publish its event data so that process mining experts can analyze the data and provide insights. However, in real-life settings, organizations need to collaborate for performing their processes, e.g., a supply chain process may involve many organizations. Therefore, event data and processes are often distributed over several partner organizations, yet organizations hesitate to share their data due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. In this paper, we introduce an abstraction-based approach to support privacy-aware process mining in inter-organizational settings. We implement our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness using real-life event logs.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a technology that enables the creation of complex shapes with advanced structural and functional properties. It has transformed the traditional manufacturing operations into a more flexible and efficient process, reshaping the whole value chain and allowing new levels of product customization. AM is a layer-by-layer manufacturing process, in which materials are deposited in each layer to create the object of interest. Due to the layer-wise nature of the process, anomalies and defects might occur within each layer, across several layers or throughout the whole sample. An accurate and responsive detection strategy that enables the detection of various types of anomalies is essential for ensuring the quality and integrity of the manufactured product. In this paper, a hierarchical in situ process monitoring approach, namely, a three level monitoring strategy, is proposed to detect local, layer-wise, and sample-wise anomalies using thermal videos acquired during the manufacturing process. The proposed approach integrates hierarchical low-rank tensor decomposition methods with statistical monitoring techniques to effectively detect anomalies at different levels, namely, the within-layer level, the layer level, and the sample level. Simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the method and compare with existing benchmarks. The proposed approach is also applied to thermal videos acquired during the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process to illustrate its effectiveness in practice. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Firstly, the pipe network data is used to calculate the local density and relative distance of all nodes in the pipe network feature space to obtain the pipe network decision graph. Then, the density peak and the number of partitions are determined by the pipe network decision graph, and the regions of pipe network nodes are divided. Finally, the location of water meter and valve is determined according to the density peak of each area and water source, so as to get the final DMA partition scheme of pipe network. The experimental results show that the method is feasible and can determine the number of partitions according to the pipe network data, and the struc-tural modularity of the pipe network partition result is higher than that of the traditional method, and the pressure uniformity is also at a higher level. © 2023, Taiwan Ubiquitous Information CO LTD.

	abstract = {The ready-mix concrete supply chain is highly disruptive due to its product perishability and Just-in-Time (JIT) production style. A lack of technology makes the ready-mix concrete (RMC) industry suffer from frequent production failures, ultimately causing high customer dissatisfaction and loss of revenues. In this paper, we propose the first-ever digital twin (DT) system in the RMC industry that can serve as a decision support tool to manage production risk efficiently and effectively via predictive maintenance. This study focuses on the feasibility of digital twins for the RMC industry in three main areas holistically: (1) the technical feasibility of the digital twin system for ready-mix concrete plant production risk management; (2) the business value of the proposed product to the construction industry; (3) the challenges of implementation in the real-world RMC industry. The proposed digital twin system consists of three main phases: (1) an IoT system to get the real-time production cycle times; (2) a digital twin operational working model with descriptive analytics; (3) an advanced analytical dashboard with predictive analytics to make predictive maintenance decisions. Our proposed digital twin solution can provide efficient and interpretable predictive maintenance insights in real time based on anomaly detection, production bottleneck identification, process disruption forecast and cycle time analysis. Finally, this study emphasizes that state-of-the-art solutions such as digital twins can effectively manage the production risks of ready-mix concrete plants by automatically detecting and predicting the bottlenecks without waiting until a production failure happens to react. © 2023 by the authors.},

However, the traditional CSCW systems have a main drawback in effectively processing and utilising knowledge across different industrial workflows. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework for collaboration between members across the manufacturing value chains to increase efficiency and reduce duplication in team cooperation. The framework contains three parts, namely workflow, knowledge mining, and services. Specifically, the workflow part provides a collaborative environment for multiple users. The knowledge mining part, as the core of the framework, extracts in-context knowledge from workflows. The part of services can interact with users with different users in each workflow, including information recommendation they need in the future or information retrieval they want to know from other workflows. Furthermore, we develop a prototype system for supporting multiple value chains collaboration to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the framework. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {A fundamental issue in manufacturing systems is moving a local manufacturer into a supply chain network including wholesalers and retailers. In this research, a 3-phase framework is proposed to determine the food consumption pattern in food supply chains. In the first stage of this research, the consumer, availability and society factors for product classification according to the features of populations in Malaysia are identified (phase 1). Then, using statistical analysis, the effective factors are recognised (phase 2). In the third phase, the product clusters are recognised using a hybrid PCA and agglomerative clustering method. For this purpose, different clusters for the training step are used. The outcomes indicated that Age (0.94), City (0.79), Health Benefit Awareness (0.76) and Education (0.75) are the most effective factors in product consumption patterns, respectively. Moreover, the efficiency of the outcomes is evaluated using the Silhouette Coefficient, indicating that the proposed algorithm could provide solutions with a 68% score. Moreover, using Calinski-Harabasz Index, it was found that the algorithm provided more logic scores while the number of product patterns was 3 for the studied region (707.54). © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Because the current algorithm fails to combine the actual needs of the demand area to build the market-value evaluation system, the user satisfaction and optimal probability decrease, and the minimum cost of the system increases. This paper proposes an optimization algorithm of overseas surgical warehouse location in the cross-border medical supply chain network based on parallel big data mining. Taking the overseas warehouse location problem of cross-border e-commerce enterprises as the research background, the paper establishes an overseas warehouse with parallel big data mining technology in the case of domestic supply points determined, so as to meet the demand of the overseas market for distribution services. According to the cross-border transportation cost, local transportation cost, and warehouse building operation cost, the total logistics cost of overseas warehouse mode is composed; the actual demand of overseas warehouse location is analyzed; and the market value is introduced into the decision-making of overseas warehouse location. Through the preliminary analysis of the factors affecting the market value, combined with the level analysis method, the market-value evaluation system of demand area is constructed, and the market value right of each demand area is calculated. By introducing the concept of time window, the customer satisfaction function is established based on whether the delivery time meets the customer's psychological expectation; by introducing market value and customer satisfaction, the multi-objective location model of customer satisfaction considering cost and market value is established. The improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to the multi-objective model to solve the multi-objective location problem with constraints, so as to obtain a higher market share and determine the best location. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve user satisfaction and optimal probability and reduce the lowest cost of the system.

	abstract = {The financial industry is a key to promoting the development of the national economy, and the risk it takes is also the largest hidden risk in the financial market. Therefore, the risk existing in the current financial market should be deeply explored under blockchain technology (BT) to ensure the functions of financial markets. The risk of financial markets is analyzed using machine learning (ML) and random forest (RF). First, the clustering method is introduced, and an example is given to illustrate the RF classification model. The collected data sets are divided into test sets and training sets, the corresponding rules are formulated and generated, and the branches of the decision tree (DT) are constructed according to the optimization principle. Finally, the steps of constructing the branches of DT are repeated until they are not continued. The results show that the three major industries of the regional economy account for 3.5%, 51.8%, 3.2%, 3.4%, and 3.8% of the regional GDP, respectively, the secondary industry makes up 44.5%, 43%, 45.1%, 44.8%, and 43.6%, respectively, and the tertiary industry occupies 20%, 3.7%, 52.3%, 52.9%, 54%, and 54.6%, respectively. This shows that with the development of the industrial structure under BT, the economic subject gradually shifts from the primary industry to the tertiary industry; BT can improve the efficiency of the financial industry and reduce operating costs and dependence on media. Meanwhile, the financial features of BT can provide a good platform for business expansion. The application of BT to the supply chain gives a theoretical reference for promoting the synergy between companies. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The machine learning model has become a critical consideration in the supply chain. Most of the companies have experienced various supply chain risks over the past three years. Earlier risk prediction has been performed by supply chain risk management. In this study, an integrated supply chain operations reference (ISCOR) model has been used to evaluate the organization's supply chain risk. Machine learning (ML) has become a hot topic in research and industry in the last few years. With this motivation, we have moved in the direction of a machine learning-based pathway to predict the supply chain risk. The great attraction of this research is that suppliers will understand the associated risk in the activity. This research includes data pre-processing, feature extraction, data transformation, and missing value replacement. The proposed integrated model involves the support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighbor (k-NN), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), multiple linear regression (MLR) algorithms, measured performance, and prediction of supply chain risk. Also, these algorithms have performed a comparative analysis under different aspects. Among the other algorithms, the random forest algorithm achieves an accuracy of 99% and has accomplished superior results with a maximum precision of 0.99, recall of 0.99, and F-score of 0.99 with 1% error rate. The model’s prediction indicates that it can be used to find the supply chain risk. Finally, the limitation and the challenges discussed also provide an outlook for future research direction to perform effective management to mitigate the risk. © 2023 International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences.

The increasing moral consciousness of stakeholders has put pressure on companies, forcing these companies to include long-term policies that reflect the regionally specific needs of stakeholders. Using a structural topic model, this study identified differences between developing and developed countries with respect to sustainability disclosures. Data were obtained from 2100 sustainability reports published in the United Nations Global Compact database for the year 2020. In global terms, these sustainability reports addressed three main topics: 1) human rights, 2) diversity, equity, and inclusion, and 3) sustainable production. Moreover, the sustainability reports from developing and developed countries incorporated different communication strategies. Based on the prevalence (rate of occurrence) of content, sustainability reports from developed countries predominantly communicated issues related to “sustainable production” and “supply chain emissions”, whereas sustainability reports from developing countries more frequently communicated issues related to “education” and “human rights".

The systematic literature review was based on a meta-synthesis methodology. The main research questions addressed were: 1) What are the main research methodologies used in AI SCM literature? 2) In what areas of SCM operations is AI (including BDA) mostly applied? 3) What are the most used AI models?

	abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models allow for a more transparent and understandable relationship between humans and machines. The insurance industry represents a fundamental opportunity to demonstrate the potential of XAI, with the industry’s vast stores of sensitive data on policyholders and centrality in societal progress and innovation. This paper analyses current Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in insurance industry practices and insurance research to assess their degree of explainability. Using search terms representative of (X)AI applications in insurance, 419 original research articles were screened from IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, Web of Science and Business Source Complete and EconLit. The resulting 103 articles (between the years 2000–2021) representing the current state-of-the-art of XAI in insurance literature are analysed and classified, highlighting the prevalence of XAI methods at the various stages of the insurance value chain. The study finds that XAI methods are particularly prevalent in claims management, underwriting and actuarial pricing practices. Simplification methods, called knowledge distillation and rule extraction, are identified as the primary XAI technique used within the insurance value chain. This is important as the combination of large models to create a smaller, more manageable model with distinct association rules aids in building XAI models which are regularly understandable. XAI is an important evolution of AI to ensure trust, transparency and moral values are embedded within the system’s ecosystem. The assessment of these XAI foci in the context of the insurance industry proves a worthwhile exploration into the unique advantages of XAI, highlighting to industry professionals, regulators and XAI developers where particular focus should be directed in the further development of XAI. This is the first study to analyse XAI’s current applications within the insurance industry, while simultaneously contributing to the interdisciplinary understanding of applied XAI. Advancing the literature on adequate XAI definitions, the authors propose an adapted definition of XAI informed by the systematic review of XAI literature in insurance. © 2022 by the authors.},

Because of the broad variety of sensors that are currently accessible, the possibilities for Internet of Things (IoT) applications in the olive oil industry are almost limitless. Although previous studies have investigated the impact of the IoT on the performance of industries, this issue has yet to be explored in the olive oil industry. In this study we aimed to develop a new model to investigate the factors influencing supply chain improvement in olive oil companies. The model was used to evaluate the relationship between supply chain improvement and olive oil companies’ performance. Demand planning, manufacturing, transportation, customer service, warehousing, and inventory management were the main factors incorporated into the proposed model. Self-organizing map (SOM) clustering and decision trees were employed in the development of the method. The data were collected from respondents with knowledge related to integrating new technologies into the industry. The results demonstrated that IoT implementation in olive oil companies significantly improved their performance. Moreover, it was found that there was a positive relationship between supply chain improvements via IoT implementation in olive oil companies and their performance. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The management of contemporary communication networks of supply chain (SC) 4.0 is becoming more complex due to the heterogeneity requirements of new devices concerning the integration of the Internet of Things in the legacy industry networks. Hence, it becomes a challenging task to secure networks of SC 4.0 from cyber-attacks and provide a robust and efficient defence framework that can resist sophisticated attacks. Machine learning-based intelligent detection algorithms are often trained at either a centralized or single server, which makes it difficult to train an effective model and also it violates privacy concerns if gathering data from other servers at the edge. Classical machine learning approaches function on the legacy group of data placed on a central or single server, which brands it the least favored choice for supply chain networks, with data privacy issues. To address these problems, this article proposes a federated learning-based efficient detection model named, DFF-SC4N, to proactively identify intrusions from SC 4.0 networks using distributed local data training. DFF-SC4N uses communication rounds in a federated learning manner having gated recurrent units by only sharing the learned parameters and keeps the data intact on local servers. The accuracy of the global model is optimized by an aggregating model, which updates from multiple servers and multiple SC 4.0 networks. Extensive experiments on real industrial network data demonstrate that the DFF-SC4N outperforms both centralized training models and state-of-the-art peer methods in protecting SC 4.0 networks.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, for controlling the organizations’ environmental impact and attaining performance enhancement in industries, green supply chain management (GSCM) plays a significant role. This work considers four major drivers and five primary dimensions for the deployment of GSCM systems in industries. The five primary dimensions are consumer intrusiveness, restructuring quality of supply chain, risk and security consciousness, and urbanization in the region leather industry, and the four major drivers are the effectiveness, features, significance, and limitations of the restructured GSCM system. Additionally, this paper investigates the primary factors that are used for deploying the GSCM system in leather industries located in the northern part of Tamil Nadu. Initially, the survey questions are prepared based on the concept and distributed to the authorities of industries. For the survey questions provided to various industries, three leather industries properly answered all the questions. Each question is mandatory. Then, the collected data were analyzed using the deep belief network (DBN) to measure the impact of primary drivers in implementing the GSCM system in industries. The performance of the proposed system is analyzed with various existing methods in terms of accuracy, precision, f-measure, etc. The proposed framework’s implementation has implications for increasing organizational efficiency, lowering costs, minimizing waste, and encouraging green culture among personnel.

	abstract = {A sustainable biomass supply chain would require not only an effective and fluid transportation system with a reduced carbon footprint and costs, but also good soil characteristics ensuring durable biomass feedstock presence. Unlike existing approaches that fail to account for ecological factors, this work integrates ecological as well as economic factors for developing sustainable supply chain development. For feedstock to be sustainably supplied, it necessitates adequate environmental conditions, which need to be captured in supply chain analysis. Using geospatial data and heuristics, we present an integrated framework that models biomass production suitability, capturing the economic aspect via transportation network analysis and the environmental aspect via ecological indicators. Production suitability is estimated using scores, considering both ecological factors and road transportation networks. These factors include land cover/crop rotation, slope, soil properties (productivity, soil texture, and erodibility factor) and water availability. This scoring determines the spatial distribution of depots with priority to fields scoring the highest. Two methods for depot selection are presented using graph theory and a clustering algorithm to benefit from contextualized insights from both and potentially gain a more comprehensive understanding of biomass supply chain designs. Graph theory, via the clustering coefficient, helps determine dense areas in the network and indicate the most appropriate location for a depot. Clustering algorithm, via K-means, helps form clusters and determine the depot location at the center of these clusters. An application of this innovative concept is performed on a case study in the US South Atlantic, in the Piedmont region, determining distance traveled and depot locations, with implications on supply chain design. The findings from this study show that a more decentralized depot-based supply chain design with 3depots, obtained using the graph theory method, can be more economical and environmentally friendly compared to a design obtained from the clustering algorithm method with 2 depots.

This paper employs a bibliometric analysis to investigate the foundations of the discipline and a quantitative approach to uncover the evolution of research in SCRM. Firstly, CiteSpace is used to evaluate and show the intellectual structure of this sector. With its help, we establish cooperation networks of institutions and countries, networks of different terms and keywords, and cooperation relations among writers. The process involves the extraction of certain useful information, such as core terms, leading authors, and major institutions. Secondly, with the help of the latent Dirichlet allocation technology, we look at the progression of the subject matter about the management of risks associated with supply chains. The outcome of this review provides a foundation for understanding developing patterns and new changes in the industry, and it is significant for future research on supply chain risk management. Our study not only updates the review of SCRM but also illustrates the possibility to objectively review literature with the support of text mining technology, using our newly developed framework.

	abstract = {Nature reserves (NRs) are the main components of protected areas and geographic spaces, with unique natural and cultural resources. The establishment of nature reserves has not only strengthened the protection of specific species but has also played a vital role in the protection of ecosystem services (ESs). However, few studies have been conducted to systematically assess the effectiveness of nature reserves from the perspective of ecosystem services supply and demand (S&D) or make comparisons between the conservation effects of different types of nature reserves. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of ecosystem service supply and demand in 412 Chinese national nature reserves. The results showed that both supply and demand for ecosystem services per unit area show a spatial pattern of increasing from west to east. The supply–demand matching pattern is dominated by high supply–high demand (H–H) and low supply–high demand (L–H) in the central and eastern regions, and high supply–low demand (H–L) and low supply–low demand (L–L) in the northeast, northwest, and southwest regions. The coupling coordination degree (CCD) of ecosystem services supply and demand increased from 0.53 in 2000 to 0.57 in 2020, and the number of NRs reaching the coordinated level (>0.5) increased by 15 from 2000 to 2020, representing 3.64% of the total number of protected areas. Steppe meadows, ocean coasts, forest ecosystems, wildlife, and wild plant types of nature reserves all improved more obviously. This provides a scientific basis for strengthening the ecological and environmental supervision of nature reserves, and the research methods and ideas can provide references for similar research. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented predicament for global supply chains (SCs). Shipments of essential and life-saving products, ranging from pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and healthcare, to manufacturing, have been significantly impacted or delayed, making the global SCs vulnerable. A better understanding of the shipment risks can substantially reduce that nervousness. Thenceforth, this paper proposes a few Deep Learning (DL) approaches to mitigate shipment risks by predicting ”if a shipment can be exported from one source to another”, despite the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed DL methodologies have four main stages: data capturing, de-noising or pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. The feature extraction stage depends on two main variants of DL models. The first variant involves three recurrent neural networks (RNN) structures (i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU)), and the second variant is the temporal convolutional network (TCN). In terms of the classification stage, six different classifiers are applied to test the entire methodology. These classifiers are SoftMax, random trees (RT), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of the proposed DL models is evaluated based on an online dataset (taken as a case study). The numerical results show that one of the proposed models (i.e., TCN) is about 100% accurate in predicting the risk of shipment to a particular destination under COVID-19 restrictions. Unarguably, the aftermath of this work will help the decision-makers to predict supply chain risks proactively to increase the resiliency of the SCs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The existing evidence suggests that suppliers bear capacity commitments due to major customers’ uncertain demand and, as a result, assume a more rigid cost structure. Therefore, this study examines whether industrial clusters affect supplier cost structures in the presence of major customers. We specifically examine whether industrial clusters mitigate the cost rigidity of suppliers driven by major customers. Using a sample of electronic firms listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and Taipei Exchange from 2005 to 2019, we find a positive relationship between suppliers’ customer concentration and cost rigidity. In particular, we find that industrial clusters significantly mitigate suppliers’ cost rigidity driven by major customers. Our results suggest that industry clustering provides more flexible resource sharing. Thus, clustered supplier firms can reduce their fixed cost investments for major customers. © 2023 Journal Of Accounting Review. All rights reserved.},

These aspects address climate change mitigation and energy scarcity ramifications and represent a continuously open is-sue. The complexity intensifies when food industries are considered, where food security and health risks must be taken into account throughout the related supply chain of the analysed products. In this study, the Resource efficient and cleaner production (RECP) concept, coupled with the Fuzzy group decision making (FGDM), is utilised on a real data set comprised of 6 meat products as a holistic frame to identify 204 involved risks and quantify their occurrence probability and impact (from the point of entering to the point of exiting) in the case of an integrated butchery unit in a largescale retail company. The identified risks, their impact, and probability are clustered to assess and quantify their relevance, environmental impact, and energy-related, in line with the RECP provision to maximise company’s resource and monetary assets while generating the least waste (incl. related expenses) and maintaining or even improving the product quality. The proposed risk categorisation (i.e. cou-pling RECP with FGDM) enables corelating the multifold requirements of risk assessment in a meat industry (in this case, an integrated butchery unit in a largescale retail company), often hindered by the vague nature and difficulties in measuring the importance and probability of the identified set of involved risks, thus contributes towards tackling complexities in similar challenging problems. © 2023, Scibulcom Ltd..

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The agri-food system is undergoing pervasive changes in business models, facilitated by the use of digital technologies. Although today it is almost inevitable for any business to adopt some level of digital transformation to strengthen their competitiveness, this transition in the agri-food sector could be more complex, given its characteristics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to analyse worldwide the perceptions of new digital technologies in the agri-food sector expressed within social media platforms, identifying the differences that may exist between them regarding its objectives and social acceptance. METHODS: This paper examines the information regarding digital transformation process in the agri-food sector disseminated worldwide on Twitter. For that purpose, Twitter API is used to gather tweets and descriptive and content analyses, including a sentiment analysis, are performed using R and MAXQDA software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that the digitalization of the agri-food sector is broadly discussed within Twitter. Different actors participate in these information flows, being companies and digital solution providers the most active users and academics and governmental institutions the most visible. Artificial Intelligence was the most mentioned technology, that together with the Internet of Things, Big Data, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, was related to improving production efficiencies, crop yield, or cost reduction. In the case of Blockchain Technology, it was closer to food supply chain actors, such as distribution companies and marketers. However, all these technologies are connected to the concept of sustainability. The sentiment analysis showed a generally positive tone, indicating social acceptance regarding the starting phase of the adoption of these technologies. The study also identified differences among countries, pointing to a stronger level of engagement with these technologies in developed regions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic was seen as a chance to boost the digital transformation in the sector all over the world. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that data harvested from Twitter provide useful insight into perceptions of digital transformation and different digital technologies in the agri-food value chain across different countries. Information that could be useful for researchers, but also for agricultural firms and policymakers. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The random noise attenuation is an essential step in seismic data processing. Due to complex geological conditions and acquisition environment, the intensity of the effective signal and random noise varies in time and space. Additionally, the morphology of seismic events is complex and diverse, such as large dips and fast changes. These complex conditions necessitate that the denoiser adjust the filtering policy dynamically. In this article, we propose a reinforcement learning-based seismic denoising (RLSD) model with the framework of asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C). In the A3C framework, the RLSD agent utilizes a policy network to learn a denoising policy for the state that is the sample of seismic data and selects a suitable filter from the preset action space composed of multiple simple and effective seismic filters with different parameters. Moreover, the RLSD agent utilizes a value network and a region-adaptive weighted reward function to accurately evaluate the denoising effect of nonstationary seismic signals. A curriculum learning approach is adopted to achieve convergence of the proposed RLSD model under complex seismic data by training from the stationary training data to nonstationary training data and make the model more suitable to the data to be processed by using a local similarity-based reward function to fine-tune the model. The synthetic and field seismic data applications confirm that the proposed RLSD model achieves a significant performance in preserving nonstationary signals and suppressing noise by adaptively adjusting the denoising policy according to the complex structural features and noise levels.

The order fulfilment process (OFP) consists of one of the key business processes for the organization SC and represents a core process for the operational logistics flow. The dispatch workflow process consists of an integral part of the OFP and is also a crucial process in the SC of cement industry organizations. In this work, we focus on enhancing the order fulfilment process by improving the dispatch workflow process, specifically with respect to the cement loading process. Thus, we proposed a machine learning (ML) approach to predict weighing deviations in the cement loading process. We adopted a realistic and robust rolling window scheme to evaluate six classification models in a real-world case study, from which the random forest (RF) model provides the best predictive performance. We also extracted explainable knowledge from the RF classifier by using the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method, demonstrating the influence of each input data attribute used in the prediction process.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is gradually valued due to its high prevalence, high risk, and high mortality. Alternative to the polysomnography (PSG) diagnosis, the proposed method assesses the subject's degree of illness considering the supply chain and Industry 5.0 requirement efficiently and accurately. This article uses the blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) signal count of the number of apnea or hypoventilation events during the sleep of the subject, calculating the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the subject's disease level. SpO2 signals are used to extract 35-D features based on the time domain, including approximate entropy, central tendency measure, and Lempel-Ziv complexity to accelerate the diagnosis process in supply chains. The feature selection process is reduced from 35 to 7 dimensions that benefits to the implementation in the practical supply chains in Industry 5.0 by extracting the extracted features. This article applies Pearson correlation coefficient selection, based on minimum redundancy-maximum correlation algorithm selection, and a wrapper based on the backward search algorithm. The accuracy rate is 86.92%, and the specificity is 90.7% under the selected random forest classifier. A random forest classifier was used to calculate the AHI index, and a linear regression analysis was performed with the AHI index obtained from the PSG. The result reaches a 92% accuracy rate in assessing the prevalence of OSAHS, satisfying the industrial deployment.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

Thus, this study aims to provide critical insight into the nexus between Blockchain and PSC and further build a conceptual framework for implementation within the pharmaceutical industry. Following a systematic literature review and text mining approach, 65 interdisciplinary articles published between 2010 and 2021 were studied to capture the decade long developments. Descriptive and thematic analysis showcases nascent developments of Blockchain in PSC. The drivers and barriers to adoption, implementation stages, and applications identified through the thematic analysis guide in setting the agenda for future research, primarily focussing on the use of Blockchain for drug counterfeiting, recall issues, along with other sector-specific challenges such as patient privacy, regulations and clinical trials. Research on Blockchain for PSC has been slow compared to other sectors, but has accelerated since the Covid-19 pandemic. Identified influential factors, implementation process and apparent applications are expected to influence researchers and practitioners in developing a roadmap for adopting Blockchain in the pharmaceutical industry. The proposed conceptual framework is novel and provides valuable directions to producers, regulators and governments to implement Blockchain in the pharmaceutical industry. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The development of the Internet has accelerated the development of electronic commerce, which has led to changes in the management of supply chains and logistics. Unlike traditional shopping trips, there is a need for home deliveries and appropriate logistics systems for their implementation. To overcome new challenges and achieve process efficiency and the quality of home delivery service, there is a need for individual or integrated application of various Industry 4.0 technologies such as the internet of things, additive manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, blockchain, big data, data mining, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, etc. Accordingly, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview and description of the application of technological solutions of Industry 4.0 in home delivery. This goal is achieved through a comprehensive literature review on the topic. The results indicate that although a large number of studies in the literature dealt with the application of individual or integrated Industry 4.0 solutions in home delivery or last-mile logistics, a comprehensive review of the application of existing solutions in home delivery has not been carried out so far. This is thereby the main contribution of this paper. Overview of the technologies application provides a basis for identification of those that have the widest possibilities and generate the most positive effects, and should thus be the focus of future studies and development plans. © 2023, Institute for research and design in industry.

	abstract = {Agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and aquaculture are activities in the primary sectors that are core sectors of the European bioeconomy. However, they have not been considered sufficiently in the bioeconomy policy framework, and neglecting the needs of actors in these sectors could have serious implications for sustainability. Against the background that the updated EU bioeconomy strategy underlines the deployment of inclusive bioeconomies, this paper examines different meanings of inclusive bioeconomies for primary producers by combining a topic modeling of European bioeconomy strategies and a storyline analysis regarding their inclusion in the EU and German bioeconomy strategies. Our analysis reveals four storylines for the inclusion of primary producers, including yield improving technologies, involvement in rural bioeconomy development, support for ecosystem-based practices, and international development. The storylines underscore the distribution of resources, and the inclusion of primary producers is considered a minor goal of the bioeconomy. While the EU strategy seeks to support local value chain development and environment-friendly practices over time, the German strategy gives importance to yield improving technologies. Ensuring consistency between and across strategies at EU and national levels is necessary for reaching the goal of an inclusive bioeconomy with primary producers in consideration. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The ubiquitous presence of printed circuit boards (PCBs) in modern electronic systems and embedded devices makes their integrity a top security concern. To take advantage of the economies of scale, today's PCB design and manufacturing are often performed by suppliers around the globe, exposing them to many security vulnerabilities along the segmented PCB supply chain. Moreover, the increasing complexity of the PCB designs also leaves ample room for numerous sneaky board-level attacks to be implemented throughout each stage of a PCB's lifetime, threatening many electronic devices. In this paper, we propose PDNPulse, a power delivery network (PDN) based PCB anomaly detection framework that can identify a wide spectrum of board-level malicious modifications. PDNPulse leverages the fact that the PDN's characteristics are inevitably affected by modifications to the PCB. By detecting changes to the PDN impedance profile against the golden model and using the Frechet distance-based anomaly detection algorithms, PDNPulse can robustly and successfully discern malicious modifications across the system. Using PDNPulse, we conduct extensive experiments on seven commercial-off-the-shelf PCBs, covering different design scales, different threat models, and seven different anomaly types. The results confirm that PDNPulse creates an effective security asymmetry between attack and defense.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This work presents the integrating process of two modularization methods: design structure matrix (DSM) and modular function deployment (MFD), to products with many components commonly found in the automotive industry. To validate this process, the authors and a cross-functional team worked on the modularization process of an air rear suspension system for heavy vehicles with 44 components. The DSM method was used first as a screening method. Its application generated the first modules reducing the number of components, since the fewer components the product has, the less laborious the application of the MFD method, and the more suitable the results (final set of modules). Therefore, the modularization process started with the DSM method base on a binary square matrix that shows the presence or absence of relationships between pairs of components in a system. A DSM algorithm reordered the binary square matrix elements to generate the preliminary modules. That way, 26 of the 44 components were grouped into eight modules that became new components, reducing the initial number of components from 44 to 26 (44 − 26 + 8). The MFD method incorporated the customer requirements using the quality function deployment (QFD), the engineering point of view utilizing the design property matrix (DPM), and the strategies of the company employing the module indication matrix (MIM) in the modularization process. The QFD matrix, DPM, and MIM union formed the product management matrix (PMM). A dendrogram helped the cross-functional team visualize the hierarchical relationship between the DPM and MIM components and analyze the modules’ set. The cross-functional team chose seven final suitable modules considering components mounting in the assembly line and the supply chain of components too. This systematic modularization process showed up efficiently and made the work of the cross-functional team easy. Finally, the cross-functional team recommended the company board invest in knowledge management tools to assist the future cross-functional teams in replicating this modularization process in other heavy vehicle systems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown the world's economy and trade into disarray, putting international reliance in the limelight. This sparked debate on the durability and resilience of global value chains. In this paper, we construct a ‘product riskiness indicator’ for 4700 globally traded products based on components such as market concentration, clustering tendencies, network centrality of players, or international substitutability to determine which products are vulnerable to trade shocks at the global level – referred to as ‘risky’ products. In a second step, bilateral risky product imports are matched to multi-country input–output tables, allowing for an examination of the importance of globally supplied risky products by country and industry. Due to the high percentage of dangerous products in high-tech product categories, higher-tech industries are more vulnerable to supply-chain vulnerabilities. Third, we analyse the GDP impact of reshoring using a “partial global extraction method.” Assuming that risky product imports from non-EU27 nations are re-shored to EU27 countries, the EU27 GDP might rise by up to 0.5 percent. Non-EU27 countries suffer as a result of such reshoring activity. This implies that ensuring robust or at least resilient supply networks is also in the interest of the supplier countries and sectors. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

A historical record book is established to manage the privacy budget according to historical query types, and a differential privacy protection algorithm based on noise reusing is used to generate and reusing noise. In the experiments, we tested the privacy budget loss, data utility and system performance based on the business data-set from chemical supply chain. The experimental results show that the blockchain system with multichain structure based on community clustering algorithm reduces the system data storage space and decreases request processing time effectively. The privacy budget loss of the proposed method is about 1/3 of that of the pure Gaussian mechanism method. After 100 queries, the total amount of noise is about 8% less than that of pure Gaussian mechanism. Besides that, the noise reusing algorithm reduces the loss of the privacy budget and breaks through the query limitation caused by privacy budget wasting. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {The rapid progress of artificial intelligence expands its wide applicability in Internet of Things (IoT). Meanwhile, data insufficient and data source privacy are key supply chain challenges facing IoT especially in the healthcare industry. To address this problem in healthcare IoT, in this article, we propose a skin cancer detection model based on federated learning integrated with deep generation model. First, we employ dual generative adversarial networks to address the problem of insufficient data. In addition, to improve the quality of generated images, we synchronously optimize the sharpness of images, Frechet inception distance, image diversity, and loss using knee point-driven evolutionary algorithm (KnEA). Then, we protect patient information privacy by training federated skin cancer framework. Finally, we employ the ISIC 2018 dataset to test the performance of the proposed training model under different situations, including using identically distributed data, nonidentically distributed data, a sparse convolutional neural network, and a fully connected convolutional neural network. The experiment results demonstrate that the accuracy and area under the curve reach 91% and 88%, respectively. This model can help resolve problems of insufficient data in smart medicine of IoT and protect the privacy of user data while also providing an excellent detection rate.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Supply chain responsiveness and big data analytics (BDA) have garnered considerable interest in academia and among practitioners. BDA helps researchers understand the current challenges in data management, including the high volume, velocity, and variety of data. This study is concerned with improving the responsiveness of supply chain networks to bike-sharing systems (BSS), which exhibit BDA characteristics. To address the challenges of forecasting bike usage and accordingly optimizing repair shop operations, we analyze multi-factor BSS data (Data from Washington D.C. BSS available to public), wherein attributes, such as weather conditions, registration, humidity, date, and time, are present. We use machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, decision-tree-based regression, K-nearest neighbor, support vectors, and ensemble random forest, to predict bike usage and repair. This work contests the results and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining machine learning with supply chain network design. Supply chain networks model bike repairs by means of capacity extensions, which entails a nonlinear problem. In this study, we utilize a gradient search to solve a nonlinear supply chain network model. By enabling capacity extension, bike repair shops within the BSS exhibit a promising 50 % reduction in lead repair time. Furthermore, a 25 % overall throughput increase in BSS is achieved. Ultimately, this study demonstrates the importance of operational flexibility in responding to big data challenges.  © 2013 IEEE.},

It can be argued that digital payment is helpful in supply chain management applications. However, the adoption of CBDC in the supply chain could bring new turbulence since the CBDC value may fluctuate. Therefore, this paper intends to optimize the production plan of manufacturing supply chain based on a volatility clustering model by reducing CBDC value uncertainty. We apply both GARCH model and machine learning model to depict the CBDC volatility clustering. Empirically, we employed Baltic Dry Index, Bitcoin and exchange rate as main variables with sample period from 2015 to 2021 to evaluate the performance of the two models. On this basis, we reveal that our machine learning model overwhelmingly outperforms the GARCH model. Consequently, our result implies that manufacturing companies’ performance can be strengthened through CBDC uncertainty reduction. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {In Industry 4.0, the development of intelligent supply chains is the key to improving enterprise efficiency and customer satisfaction. At present, the strategy with blockchain to optimize the supply chain ensures the security of data sharing and interaction between different suppliers. However, the quality of service (QoS) loss in time efficiency and supplier cooperation is still a severe problem in these strategies. Therefore, it is essential to conduct reputable supplier selection to reduce QoS loss under the premise of blockchain security. Meanwhile, choosing a reputable supplier as the primary peer in the blockchain consensus process can also effectively reduce transaction latency. To solve this problem, a reputation-aware supplier assessment system, named SAS, is proposed. Specifically, Canopy and K-medoids are utilized to classify suppliers preliminarily. Then backpropagation neural network is deployed to evaluate supplier reputation. The results show that SAS is effective in supplier reputation evaluation through extensive experiments.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

Over the past years, digitization in AFSCs has emerged as a new paradigm. In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing approach, providing a huge amount of information to manage AFSCs. Thus, the purpose of this article is to examine extensive studies on IoT-based AFSC. Our research starts with the identification of 346 articles in the relevant field from the Web of Science (WoS) database by applying rigorous filtration. Using the VOS viewer software, a network analysis has been performed. With seven identified clusters, this article recognizes the role of IoT technologies as Cluster 1: agri-food safety, traceability and sustainability; Cluster 2: AFSC sustainability; Cluster 3: AFSC performance measurement; Cluster 4: AFSC resilience in disruption; Cluster 5: AFSC integration and traceability; Cluster 6: AFSC transparency and coordination, and finally Cluster 7 identifies the barriers in IoT adoption. Thus, findings of this study offer robust guidance to link IoT technologies and AFSCs together. Based on these findings, propositions are proposed and a research framework is established. We believe the findings would help engineering managers, researchers, and government regulating bodies better plan and manage AFSCs for social good. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

The study makes use of state-of-the-art analytical framework based on a unified approach to reveal insights from the present body of knowledge and the potentials for future research developments. Design/methodology/approach: Unlike standard literature reviews, in SLR, a structured approach is followed. The approach enables utilizing contemporary tools and software packages such as R-package “bibliometrix” and Gephi for exploratory and visual analytics. A number of clustering methods are employed to form clusters. Later, multivariate analysis methodologies are adopted to determine the dominant clusters for the influential co-cited references. Findings: Using contemporary tools from Bibliometric Analysis (BA), the authors identify in an exploratory analysis, the influential authors, sources, regions, affiliations and papers. In addition, the use of network analysis tools reveals research clusters, topological analysis, key research topics, interrelation and authors’ collaboration along with their patterns. Finally, the optimum number of clusters computed for cluster analysis is decided using a systematic procedure based on multivariate analysis such as k-means and factor analysis. Originality/value: Modern-day supply chains increasingly depend on developing superior insights from large amounts of data available from diverse sources in unstructured and semi-structured formats. In order to maintain a competitive edge, the supply chains need to perform speedy analysis of big data using efficient tools that provide real-time decision-making insights. Such an analysis necessitates automated processing using intelligent ML algorithms. Through a BA followed by a detailed data visualization in a network analysis enabled grasping key features of the contemporary literature. The analysis is based on 155 documents from the period 2008 to 2018 selected using a systematic selection procedure. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Background: Manufacturing companies optimize logistics network routing to reduce transportation costs and operational costs in order to make profits in an extremely competitive environment. Therefore, the efficiency of logistics management in the supply chain and the quick response to customers’ demands are treated as an additional source of profit. One of the warehouse operations for intelligent logistics network design, called cross-docking (CD) operations, is used to reduce inventory levels and improve responsiveness to meet customers’ requirements. Accordingly, the optimization of a vehicle dispatch schedule is imperative in order to produce a routing plan with the minimum transport cost while meeting demand allocation. Methods: This paper developed a two-phase algorithm, called sAIS, to solve the vehicle routing problem (VRP) with the CD facilities and systems in the logistics operations. The sAIS algorithm is based on a clustering-first and routing-later approach. The sweep method is used to cluster trucks as the initial solution for the second phase: optimizing routing by the Artificial Immune System. Results: In order to examine the performance of the proposed sAIS approach, we compared the proposed model with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) on the VRP with pickup and delivery benchmark problems, showing average improvements of 7.26%. Conclusions: In this study, we proposed a novel sAIS algorithm for solving VRP with CD problems by simulating human body immune reactions. The experimental results showed that the proposed sAIS algorithm is robustly competitive with the GA on the criterion of average solution quality as measured by the two-sample t-test. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Multi-criteria ABC classification is an effective technique that allows rapid and automatic organization of a growing number of inventory items into classes having different managerial levels. These built classes help decision-makers efficiently control the inventory and optimize the whole supply chain. However, existing ABC classification methods work as black-box processes that produce ABC classes without providing any explanations behind the assignment of the items. Given the multi-criteria nature of the ABC classification problem, managers cannot easily analyze and interpret the item managerial classes. Another problem of existing methods is their inability to follow the Pareto principle which states that items must be Pareto distributed over the ABC classes. To solve these two problems, we propose a semi-supervised explainable approach based on both semi-supervised clustering and explainable artificial intelligence. The semi-supervised technique is used to integrate an intelligent initialization and a constrained clustering process that guides the classification process to lead to Pareto distributed items, whereas explainable artificial intelligence is used to build detailed micro and macro explanations of the inventory classes at the item and the class levels. Application of the proposed approach for the automatic classification of chemical products of a distribution company has shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing accurate, transparent, and well-explained ABC classes.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud enterprise resource planning (Cloud ERP) provides an efficient big data management solution for lithium-ion battery (LiB) enterprises. However, in the open ecological environment, Cloud ERP makes the LiB supply chain face multi-user and multi-subject interactions, which can generate sensitive data and privacy data security issues (such as user override access behavior). In this study, we take the value and information interaction into account to examine the user behaviors of the diverse stakeholders in the LiB supply chain. Therefore, a user behavior monitoring algorithm (UBMA), different from the mainstream supervised algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms, is proposed to monitor the unsafe behaviors that may threaten data privacy in Cloud ERP. The results show that the UBMA can accurately search out the user behavior sequence where the unsafe behavior is located from a large amount of user behavior information, which reduces the complexity of directly identifying the unsafe behavior. In addition, compared with the recursive unsupervised binary classification method, the UBMA model has a lower resource consumption and higher efficiency. In addition, the UBMA has great flexibility. The UBMA can be further updated and extended by re-establishing the statistical characteristics of the standard user behavior fields to quickly adapt to user changes and function upgrades in the LiB supply chain. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Retailing is a dynamic business domain where commodities and goods are sold in small quantities directly to the customers. It deals with the end user customers of a supply-chain network and therefore has to accommodate the needs and desires of a large group of customers over varied utilities. The volume and volatility of the business makes it one of the prospective fields for analytical study and data modeling. This is also why customer segmentation drives a key role in multiple retail business decisions such as marketing budgeting, customer targeting, customized offers, value proposition etc. The segmentation could be on various aspects such as demographics, historic behavior or preferences based on the use cases. In this paper, historic retail transactional data is used to segment the customers using K-Means clustering and the results are utilized to arrive at a transition matrix which is used to predict the cluster movements over the time period using Markov Model algorithm. This helps in calculating the futuristic value a segment or a customer brings to the business. Strategic marketing designs and budgeting can be implemented using these results. The study is specifically useful for large scale marketing in domains such as e-commerce, insurance or retailers to segment, profile and measure the customer lifecycle value over a short period of time. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

Numerous studies have been conducted in recent years on supply chain waste and how to manage it to improve product quality. Discussing this issue can help solve supply chain deficiencies and improve its performance, increasing production efficiency and customer satisfaction. This study examines the issue using two valid methods. Initially, text mining on Twitter was used to extract hashtags for Apple smartphones. Then, sentiment analysis was used to distinguish between complaints and negative tweets about services or device performance. Afterward, the most frequently occurring deficiencies (23 deficiencies) that resulted in dissatisfaction were identified. Eventually, 14 deficiencies were selected after consulting with experts. These cases were attributed to various supply chain steps using the Delphi method and Apple's reports. Finally, the highest degree of agreement between the cases and supply chain steps was determined through the Delphi process, consultation with experts, and statistical methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

In the logistics supply chain, due to the high value of the items inside the arrival carton, appearance inspection must be carried out before warehousing. However, manual inspection is slow and ineffective, resulting in the waste of manpower and packaging carton resources, which is not conducive to sustainable development. To address the above problems, this paper designs a logistics supply chain carton packaging quality defect detection system based on improved Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) in the context of green sustainable development. The Implicit Feature Pyramid Network (IFPN) is introduced into SSD to improve the feature extraction ability of the model; the multiscale attention mechanism is introduced to collect more feature information. The experiment shows that the mAP and FPS of the system on the self-built data set reach 0.9662 and 36 respectively, which can realise the detection of the appearance defects of logistics cartons and help promote green sustainable development.  © 2023 Bing Song et al., published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {The transition from the current energy architecture to a new model is evident and inevitable. The coming future promises innovative and increasingly rigorous projects and challenges for everyone involved in this value chain. Technological developments have allowed the emergence of new concepts, such as renewable energy communities, decentralized renewable energy production, and even energy storage. These factors have incited consumers to play a more active role in the electricity sector and contribute considerably to the achievement of environmental objectives. With the introduction of renewable energy communities, the need to develop new management and optimization tools, mainly in generation and load management, arises. Thus, this paper proposes a platform capable of clustering consumers and prosumers according to their energy and geographical characteristics to create renewable energy communities. Thus, this paper proposes a platform capable of clustering consumers and prosumers according to their energy and geographical characteristics to create renewable energy communities. Moreover, through this platform, the identification (homogeneous energy communities, mixed energy communities, and self-sufficient energy communities) and the size of each community are also obtained. Three algorithms are considered to achieve this purpose: K-means, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, and linkage algorithms (single-link, complete-link, average-link, and Wards’ method). With this work, it is possible to verify each algorithm’s behavior and effectiveness in clustering the players into communities. A total of 233 members from 9 cities in the northern region of Portugal (Porto District) were considered to demonstrate the application of the proposed platform. The results demonstrate that the linkage algorithms presented the best classification performance, achieving 0.631 by complete-ink in the Silhouette score, 2124.174 by Ward’s method in the Calinski-Harabasz index, and 0.329 by single-link on the Davies-Bouldin index. Additionally, the developed platform demonstrated adequacy, versatility, and robustness concerning the classification and sizing of renewable energy communities. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Supply chain interruptions have been identified as a key risk factor. Supply chain risk management has been driven by technological advancements, an increase in information overload, and a greater exposure to risk. Data mining uses a variety of analytical methods to make intelligent and fast decisions; yet, its utility in supply chain risk management has yet to be fully realized. The risk in the supply chain is prioritized using machine learning techniques. The majority of supply chain studies, on the other hand, focus on prediction efficiency and ignore the significance of interpretability, which helps experts to mitigate or avoid risks. The goal of this study is to develop a data mining-based cuckoo search support vector machine supply chain risk management (DM-CSVM SCRM) for predicting hazards in supply chains, as well as identifying, assessing, and mitigating them. A supply chain risk prediction is done by using a machine learning algorithm in this project. A holistic approach to risk management combines risk management and DM operations into a single structure for efficient management of risk. Based on discussions, focus group interviews, and semi-structured interviews the framework is tested in this study. The research shows how DM can help you find unseen and relevant data in unstructured risk data so you can make better risk decisions. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.},

	abstract = {Purpose: While a global supply network can provide stability to address localized interruptions, however, the recent global pandemic materialized many concerns and risks associated with the global supply network. Considering the short-term and long-term effects of changes in the global supply chain, this research explores how the location characteristics of the firms across the supply chain affect their performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using the mined data from five tiers of the backward supply chain of medical equipment, the authors constructed a large supply chain network consisting of close to 160,000 dyadic connections. The authors used various network centrality and clustering algorithms to measure the influence of each firm across the supply chain structure. Furthermore, the authors ran a scenario to simulate the elimination of Chinese firms from the global supply chain and recalculated all centralities. Regression analysis was used to measure the effect of supply chain network centralities on firms' performance across the supply chain with and without Chinese firms. Findings: The complexity of global purchasing across global tiers of supply networks had been recognized as a source of uncertainty before the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic was the black swan that the medical supply chain professionals had noted its threat in recent years. While a global supply network can provide stability to address localized interruptions, however, the recent global pandemic materialized many concerns and risks associated with the global supply network. Considering the short-term and long-term effects of changes in the global supply chain, this research explores how the location characteristics of the firms across the supply chain affect their performance. Research limitations/implications: This research has three main implications. First, it provides a benchmark for manufacturing firms and distributors around the world operating in the post-COVID-19 business environment to better understand the relationship of their supply chain strategy and firms' financial performance. Second, investors and asset managers can evaluate their portfolios in light of the changing relationship as a result of possible protectionism initiatives. Finally, policymakers can apply the research methodology of this work in various industries while reevaluating post-COVID-19 international relations and trades policies at the firm, industry and country levels. Practical implications: Policymakers working on global connection can utilize the outcome of this research to explore the consequences of local and global policies on trade patterns, organizational performance as well as individuals' movements. Another implication of this study for policymakers is that it provides a powerful simulation and analytical tool to launch or combat the global ruptures, including trade wars and natural disasters stemming from natural events (e.g. climate change) and human-made events (e.g. wars, supply-chain interruptions, sanctions). Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale empirical study that measures the effect of supply chain structure across multiple (five) tiers of the global supply chain on firms' performance. The present study uses the original supply chain network data mined by the authors from financial publications. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In the field of blockchain (BC) technology application in the food supply chain (FSC), a patent portfolio is collected, described, and analyzed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling, with the aim of obtaining insight into technology trends in this emerging and promising field. A patent portfolio consisting of 82 documents was extracted from patent databases using PatSnap software. The analysis of latent topics using LDA indicates that inventions related to the application of BCs in FSCs are patented in four key areas: (A) BC-supported tracing and tracking in FSCs; (B) devices and methods supporting application of BCs in FSCs; (C) combining BCs and other ICT technologies in FSC; and (D) BC-supported trading in FSCs. Patenting of BC technology applications in FSCs started during the second decade of the 21st century. Consequently, patent forward citation has been relatively low, while the family size confirms that application of BCs in FSCs is not yet widely accepted. A significant increase in the number of patent applications was registered after 2019, indicating that the number of potential users in FSCs is expected to grow over time. The largest numbers of patents originate from China, India, and the US. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The recent surge in behavioral studies on the coordination mechanisms in supply chains (SCs) and advanced methods highlights the role of SC coordination (SCC) and behavioral issues associated with improving the performance of the operations. This study aims to critically review the behavioral aspect of channel coordination mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: Following a systematic literature review methodology, the authors adopt a combination of bibliometric (to reflect the current state of the field), content (using Leximancer data mining software to develop thematic maps) and theory-oriented qualitative analyzes that provide a holistic conceptual framework to unify the literature’s critical concepts. Findings: The analysis confirms the plethora of risk-oriented publications, demonstrating that the second largest category of studies is concerned with social preferences theory. Most studies were based on experiments, followed by analytical modeling, revealing the impact of heuristics and individual preferences in SC decisions and suggesting promising managerial and theoretical avenues for future research. Originality/value: The study sheds light on behavioral decision theories applied to SC coordination by categorizing the literature based on the adopted theories. The methodological contributions include using automated content analysis and validating the outcome by interviewing leading scholars conducting active research on “behavioral operations management and SC contracts.” The authors also propose several directions for future research based on the research gaps. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Agricultural product circulation is an appropriate way to optimize the distribution of agricultural resources and maintain food safety. The seasonality of agriculture leads to seasonal variations in agricultural product circulation. Previous studies constructed origin–destination networks based on annual statistics to investigate the static structure of agricultural product circulation networks from a single view, failing to capture the seasonal and multi-dimensional characteristics in agricultural product circulation. This study presents a multi-view analytical framework used to investigate the seasonal characteristics of an agricultural product circulation network. First, agricultural product circulation networks in different seasons were constructed with mass freight trajectory data through trajectory mining technology. Then, the seasonal characteristics of agricultural product circulation were, respectively, analyzed from a macro-view (networks), meso-view (edges) and micro-view (nodes). A case study was conducted in Beijing, China. It is argued that: (1) The presented method for extracting agricultural trip chains based on massive freight trajectories is feasible for the construction of agricultural product circulation networks. (2) The agricultural product circulation networks in four seasons exhibit an obvious hierarchical and radial structure. South China has a higher network density in winter and spring, whereas northeast and northwest China are the opposite. (3) A total of 80% of the linkage strength is concentrated, on average, in 35.3% of city-pairs in four seasons, where the agglomeration effect and hub status of the linking cities is more prominent in summer and autumn. (4) A total of 316 cities form Beijing agricultural product circulation networks, 48.1% of which are mainly served by Beijing agricultural product circulation in winter and spring, which is 2.7 times more than cities served in summer and autumn. These findings extend the scientific understanding of the agricultural product supply chain from a dynamic and multi-dimensional view, which provides essential information for optimizing sustainable agri-food systems and ensuring food security. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 has driven the formation of regional supply chains. In addition, cities became the basic units of intra-regional supply chain organization under urban administrative economies. Based on the data mining of the buyer-supplier relationship of listed manufacturing firms, this study explores the spatial characteristics of city supply networks within Shandong by the indexes of degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and a community detection algorithm using the social network analysis (SNA) method and ArcGIS software. It investigates the influencing factors of city supply networks by the correlation and regression of the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP). The results show the following: 1) Shandong has formed a multi-center city supply network with Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai-Weihai, and the distribution pattern of city centrality measured by different centrality indicators shows differences. 2) Cities belonging to the same network community show a coexistence of spatial proximity and “enclave” distribution. 3) Geographic proximity, convenient transportation links, administrative district economy, similarity of business environments represented by development zones, export-oriented or domestic market-oriented division of labor between cities, value chain division of labor between cities, and land price differences between cities promote the formation of regional city supply networks. Conversely, differences in local market size and wage levels between cities hinder the formation of city supply networks. This study attempts to apply the analysis results to regional planning from the perspective of regional industrial synergy development. Additionally, as it is based on typical Chinese provinces, it can provide policy references for national administrative regions and countries/regions at similar spatial scales for manufacturing supply chains, as well as for regional spatial layout decisions of manufacturing enterprises.

	abstract = {Water-carbon nexus exerts significant influence on environmental sustainability. The demand-side patterns of water-carbon nexus in supply chains have been extensively conducted. However, there is still research gap in unveiling supply-side complex relationships among various sectors from multi-policy perspectives. In this study, a factorial stepwise-clustering input-output (FSCIO) model is developed to uncover the complicated water-carbon nexus accompanied by analyses of multi-element, multi-sector and multi-policy. This is the first time that input-output analysis (IOA), stepwise cluster analysis (SCA) and factorial analysis (FA) are integrated to explore water-carbon nexus. Water-carbon flows along supply chains are tracked through IOA. SCA helps identify key sectors through evaluating the complexities in water-carbon nexus. FA helps examine different supply-side policies (i.e., input- and allocation-oriented policies, abbreviated as IOP and AOP) through quantifying the effects of multiple sectors and their interactions. We find that China's water-carbon characteristics in supply side differ greatly from those in demand side (e.g., construction is a significant final consumer and other service is more prominent as a primary supplier). The impacts of supply-side policies on different sectors vary significantly and AOP is generally better than IOP in the trade-off between water-carbon pressures mitigation and economic development. The effects of multiple sectors and their interactions on water and carbon shouldn't be neglected and the appropriate policy combinations could have good synergistic effects (e.g., IOP on electricity-gas-water supply, and AOP on chemical, machinery and other service). This study not only provides insight into the multifaceted features of China's water-carbon nexus, but also provides guidance for the supply-side policies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

The problem is a lack of accurate lead time information, leading to difficulties in meeting customer demand. The proposed solution is a framework using an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model for lead time forecasting and anomaly detection. The framework combines CNN (Convolution neural network) -Bidirectional LSTM model for forecasting and an LSTM autoencoder with One-Class Support Vector Machine for anomaly detection. The data was obtained from a legal ERP system of a major automotive distributor in Morocco. The results show that the framework is effective in overcoming the lead time information issue, and the relevance of the methods used has been verified via precise performance indicators, such as the RMSE (Root of the mean of the square of the errors) testifying to the accuracy of the results and also through comparison with other models. © 2023 Operations and Supply Chain Management Forum.

Through a systematic literature review, this paper conceptualizes Industry 4.0 ESCRM using a DM framework by providing taxonomies for environmental risks, levels, consequences, and strategies to address them. This study proposes a comprehensive guide to systematically identify, gather, monitor, and assess environmental risk data from various sources.

	abstract = {A data-driven modelling approach was applied to quantify the potential groundwater yield from weathered crystalline basement aquifers in West Africa, which are a strategic resource for achieving water and food security. To account for possible geological control on aquifer productivity, seven major geological domains were identified based on lithological, stratigraphic, and structural characteristics of the crystalline basement. Extensive data mining was conducted for the hydrogeological parameterisation that led to the identification of representative distributions of input parameters for numerical simulations of groundwater abstractions. These were calibrated to match distributions of measured yields for each domain. Calibrated models were then applied to investigate aquifer and borehole scenarios to assess groundwater productivity. Considering the entire region, modelling results indicate that approximately 50% of well-sited standard 60-m-deep boreholes could sustain yields exceeding 0.5 L/s, and 25% could sustain the yield required for small irrigation systems (> 1.0 L/s). Results also highlighted some regional differences in the ranges of productivities for the different domains, and the significance of the depth of the static water table and the lateral extent of aquifers across all geological domains. This approach can be applied to derive groundwater maps for the region and provide the quantitative information required to evaluate the potential of different designs of groundwater supply networks. © 2023, Crown.},

However, this often brings redundant and irrelevant information which greatly impairs the performance of prediction algorithms. Therefore, this study proposes an HDNN algorithm that is an improved deep neural network (DNN) algorithm and can be used for high dimensional prediction of corporate credit risk. We firstly theoretically proved that there was no regularization effect when L1 regularization was added to the batch normalization layer of the DNN, which was a hidden rule in the industrial implementation but never been proved. In addition, we proved that adding L2 constraints on a single L1 regularization can solve the issue. Finally, this study analyzed a case study of credit data with supply chain and network data to show the superiority of the HDNN algorithm in the scenario of a high dimensional dataset. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The current COVID-19 pandemic has virtually disrupted supply chains worldwide. Thus, supply chain research has received significant attention. While the impacts have been immeasurable, organizations have realized the need to design strategies to overcome such unexpected events. Therefore, the supply chain research landscape has evolved to address the challenges during the pandemic. However, available literature surveys have not explored the power of text analytics. Hence, in this review, an analysis of the supply chain literature related to the impacts of COVID-19 is performed to identify the current research trends and future research avenues. To discover the frequent topics discussed in the literature, bibliometric analysis (i.e., keyword co-occurrence network) and text mining tools (i.e., N-gram analysis and topic modeling) are employed for the whole corpus and the top-three contributing journals (i.e., Sustainability, International Journal of Logistics Management, Operations Management Research). Moreover, text analytics (i.e., Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency: TF-IDF) is utilized to discover the distinctive topics in the corpus and per journals. A total of 574 papers published up to the first semester of 2022 were collected from the Scopus database to determine the research trends and opportunities. The keyword network identified four clusters considering the implementation of digitalization to achieve resilience and sustainability, the usage of additive manufacturing during the pandemic, the study of food supply chains, and the development of supply chain decision models to tackle the pandemic. Moreover, the segmented keyword network analysis and topic modeling were performed for the top three contributors. Although both analyses draw the research concentrations per journal, the keyword network tends to provide a more general scope, while the topic modeling gives more specific topics. Furthermore, TF-IDF scores unveiled topics rarely studied, such as the implications of the pandemic on plasma supply chains, cattle supply chains, and reshoring decisions, to mention a few. Additionally, it was observed how the different methodologies implemented allowed to complement the information provided by each method. Based on the findings, future research avenues are discussed. Therefore, this research will help supply chain practitioners and researchers to identify supply chain advancements, gaps in the literature and future research streams. © 2022 by the authors.},

For this purpose, tests were performed to determine the head loss in ten different valves in four openings with five replicates. A hydraulic head loss testing apparatus was set up in a pipeline network that allowed for the control, monitoring, and acquisition of data. Mean values of the K coefficient of the minor head loss and the equivalent length were estimated for the conditions evaluated. The results were analyzed using box plots, correlation, principal components analysis, and hierarchical clustering. In general, the gate valves showed lower head loss for all the relative openings considered, while the pressure valves showed the greatest head loss. Of the clusters formed, for the second group, there was a predominance of treatments with pressure valves, which showed similarity in terms of the values of the hydraulic variables due to the geometry and construction of the valves. © 2023 Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons license.},

	abstract = {Shipping, as an important part of the global supply chain, has always been quite sensitive to maritime accidents. Fatality and injury are important metrics indicating an accident’s severity. Understanding the driving factors of fatality and injury outcomes of maritime accidents can help to improve supply chain security. Based on maritime accident data obtained from the Lloyd’s List Intelligence, this paper identifies accident-prone sea areas through kernel density estimation (KDE) and selects two of the areas to conduct a comparative study on factors contributing to fatality and injury outcomes of maritime accidents through zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) and elastic analysis. The results show that collision and ship age significantly impact the number of fatalities and injuries. Specifically, collision and ship age have greater impacts on fatality and injury outcomes of accidents that occurred in the English Channel and North Sea. Whether the accident occurs in ports and whether the accident causes a total loss have more significant impacts on the fatality and injury outcomes of accidents in the Black Sea and the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The research results can potentially support the reduction of fatalities and injuries in maritime accident and help to manage maritime risk. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Economic and operational advantages have led the supply chain of printed circuit boards (PCBs) to incorporate various untrusted entities. Any of the untrusted entities are capable of introducing malicious alterations to facilitate a functional failure or leakage of secret information during field operation. While researchers have been investigating the threat of malicious modification within the scale of individual microelectronic components, the possibility of a board-level malicious manipulation has essentially been unexplored. In the absence of standard benchmarking solutions, prospective countermeasures for PCB trust assurance are likely to utilize homegrown representation of the attacks that undermine their evaluation and do not provide scope for comparison with other techniques. In this article, we have developed a benchmarking solution to facilitate an unbiased and comparable evaluation of countermeasures applicable to PCB trust assurance. Based on a taxonomy tailored for PCB-level alterations, we have developed a toolflow for the automatic generation of Trojan benchmarks to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation against a large number of diverse Trojan implementations and application of data mining for trust verification. Using the toolflow, we have developed a suite of custom 'Trojan benchmarks' (i.e., PCB designs with Trojans) containing representative examples of Trojans in the taxonomy inserted in different PCB designs of varying complexity and functionality. Finally, with experimental measurements from a fabricated PCB and structural analysis of netlist, we analyze the stealthiness of the Trojan designs and present the runtime of the tool for a large number of PCB designs.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

Thermal imaging was used to determine different pineapple varieties according to the physicochemical changes of the fruit by means of the deep learning method. Deep learning has gained attention in fruit classification and recognition in unimodal processing. This paper proposes a multimodal data fusion framework for the determination of pineapple quality using deep learning methods based on the feature extraction acquired from thermal imaging. Feature extraction was selected from the thermal images that provided a correlation with the quality attributes of the fruit in developing the deep learning models. Three different types of deep learning architectures, including ResNet, VGG16, and InceptionV3, were built to develop the multimodal data fusion framework for the classification of pineapple varieties based on the concatenation of multiple features extracted by the robust networks. The multimodal data fusion coupled with powerful convolutional neural network architectures can remarkably distinguish different pineapple varieties. The proposed multimodal data fusion framework provides a reliable determination of fruit quality that can improve the recognition accuracy and the model performance up to 0.9687. The effectiveness of multimodal deep learning data fusion and thermal imaging has huge potential in monitoring the real-time determination of physicochemical changes of fruit. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to analyze the state of knowledge on the relationship between leadership and the firm’s supply chain. The study identifies and examines the existing literature, unveils research gaps and suggests future research directions. Design/methodology/approach: Adopting a systematic review process, a total of 110 articles published in top-ranked academic journals (A* and A category as per ABDC-2019 list) were analyzed. Descriptive, cluster, thematic and regression analyses of citations were performed to garner insights. Findings: The review outcome shows an upward trend of articles studying the influence of leadership in the supply chain. With the highest number of articles, developed countries and manufacturing companies have been the research contexts of the research studies. Clustering reveals eight significant areas where the leader’s involvement in the supply chain is discussed, with several sub-themes emerging within each cluster. Finally, the regression analysis of citations shows that only the journal’s quality matters the most in receiving the highest citation for the articles. Research limitations/implications: As this study considered only A* and A-ranked journals of the ABDC-2019 list, there is a risk of excluding some relevant articles. Originality/value: While the current literature deliberates on recent trends in the supply chain, such as the application of Industry 4.0 practices, this review revolves around the classical theme of leadership and demonstrates its importance in the supply chain. The study is among the first to conduct a bibliometric analysis of articles deliberating on leadership and supply chain issues by grouping the articles into clusters and themes. In the end, the clusters and themes were conceptualized into the “House of Supply Chain Leadership,” of which leadership forms the foundation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Literature has focused mainly on the effect of the pandemic on the supply chain or in its value chain but little has been said on the competitive strategies adopted to overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted on Italian companies operating in the agri-food industry from May to September 2020, following a mixed method approach. First, a focus group with experts in competitive strategy and agri-food industry has been organized to identify the most important challenges that companies are facing. Second, through a structured questionnaire, data from 123 companies operating in the agri-food industry were gathered and analyzed with K-means clustering method. Findings: Four clusters of companies were identified, each implementing different strategies to face the COVID-19 pandemic: “the cost fanatics”, “the brand focused”, “the sales centered” and “the strategists”. Furthermore, it was possible to identify new trends in competitive strategies to increase the added value that the Italian agri-food industry can provide to the customer. Originality/value: The paper answers to the need for an investigation of the competitive strategies that agri-food companies have put in place to face the COVID-19 pandemic; moreover, it provides insights on how companies are adapting themselves to this rapidly changing environment. From a managerial point of view, it gives practitioners and managers useful insights on the different strategies that companies are undertaking to maintain a competitive advantage. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Based on previous evidence, the use of blockchain for improving Supply Chains (SCs) regarding humanitarian projects has received attention over the past five years. The present study is innovative in investigating crucial parameters affecting the using of Blockchain Technology (BT) in Humanitarian Supply Chains (HSCs). More precisely, this study emphasizes parameters that affect blockchain in the HSCs and presents a new fuzzy large-scale group decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (fuzzy large-scale group-DEMATEL) approach to analyze the interdependence of contributing factors for using BT in HSCs. This method consists of two stages: (1) clustering the large-scale group-experts into small subgroups by their characteristics, and (2) identifying the key factors affecting BT in HSCs with a novel fuzzy large-scale group-DEMATEL approach. According to experts, in this study, among the 25 evaluated factors, disintermediation has been identified as the most important one, followed by anonymity and security. A closer look reveals that 13 and 12 factors have been “cause” and “effect” factors, respectively. Our research can be used to promote the effectiveness of using BT in HSCs, so as to promote the proper distribution of relief materials in practical disasters. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {In order to realize the goals of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), which has data interoperability as one of its core principles, the future research in the Supply Chain (SC) visibility has to be aligned with socially, economically and environmentally sustainable objectives. Within the purview of circular economy, this paper indicates various aspects and implications of data sharing in the SCs in light of the published research. Taking into consideration the heterogeneity of data sources and standards, this article also catalogs all the major data-sharing technologies being employed in sharing data digitally across the SCs. Drawing on the published research from 2015 to 2021, following the PRISMA framework, this paper presents the state of research in the field of data sharing in SCs in terms of their standardization, optimization, simulation, automation, security and more notably sustainability. Using the co-occurrence metric, bibliometric analysis has been conducted such that the collected research is categorized under various keyword clusters and regional themes. This article brings together two major themes in reviewing the research in the field. Firstly, the bibliometric analysis of the published articles demonstrates the contours of the current state of research and the future possibilities in the field. Secondly, in synthesizing the research on the foundations of sustainability within the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, this article deals with various aspects and implications of information sharing in the SCs. By bringing these two themes together, this paper affords a prospective researcher with the research vis-à-vis the information sharing in SC, starting from the actual data standards in use to the modality and consequence of their application within the perspective of the circular economy. This article, in essence, indicates how all the aspects of data sharing in SCs may be brought together in service of the paradigm of I5.0. © 2022},

Therefore, the maintenance of food safety has become a key value. This study expects to solve the food safety problem and bring more benefits to people using intelligent systems. To meet the safety needs of the collaborative food supply chain, this study designed a food safety protection system architecture which collects the supply and sales data of various suppliers, as well as the data of equipment used in production. The architecture can carry out anomaly detections with machine learning to make a preliminary judgement on whether a problem has occurred in this batch of food during the transaction, and then implement in-depth anomaly detections with the supplier's equipment to determine the stage at which this problem occurred. The proposed system can help food operators achieve effective food monitoring, prediction, prevention, and improvement, thereby improving food safety. © 2023 IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The feasibility of applying a low-cost and portable NIR spectrometer to detect the S-ovalbumin content of eggs was investigated in this study, and a model population analysis based competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (MPA-CARS) algorithm was proposed to reduce the dimensionality of spectral data. The NIR spectra of egg samples with different storage periods were collected in the wavelength range of 900–1700 nm. Standard normal variate (SNV) and Savitzky–Golay1st derivative were used to preprocess the raw spectral data. Then, CARS and the proposed MPA-CARS were applied to select effective wavelengths from the whole spectral range. Statistical results showed that MPA-CARS had better feature extraction performance than CARS and the number of selected feature wavelengths was less. Support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used to establish calibration models for predicting S-ovalbumin content, in which the simplified XGBoost model based on MPA-CARS feature wavelengths yielded the best performance, with R2P of 0.906 and RMSEP of 7.799%. Therefore, portable NIR has the potential to be a useful tool for S-ovalbumin content detection. This could help food processing industry to arrange miniaturized NIR sensors to detect egg quality at different points in the egg supply chain. Practical applications: S-ovalbumin content is a freshness index of eggs and can affect the quality of processed foods. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using portable NIR spectrometer to detect the S-ovalbumin content of eggs, which can help food processing agencies to implement low-cost NIR sensors to detect egg quality at different stages of the supply chain. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {Spatial analysis of industrial locations is an important tool for cluster-based economic development that helps identify hot spots for attracting new businesses in a particular region. The forest product industry in North Carolina (NC) is the top employer among all manufacturing sectors, with a substantial contribution to the state economy. Using geographic information system tools, we examined the current spatial distribution of the primary and secondary forest product manufacturers (FPM) and available forest resources to identify major hot spots in NC. Additionally, by estimating count data models, this study evaluated factors influencing the location of FPMs across counties in NC. Our results suggested that primary FPMs exhibit a higher spatial dependency relative to secondary FPMs. Similarly, regression results suggested that the counties near cities with high population, hot spots of raw materials, and better county economy are more likely to host both primary and secondary FPMs in the counties of NC. The findings of this study shed light on how the clustering of forest product manufacturing firms may influence competition between FPMs, sustainable supply of raw materials, and supply-chain networks in forest-dependent rural regions. © The Author(s) 2022.

This paper develops a computational, data-driven synthesis of the scholarly literature versus news media on BT-enabled supply chain management (BT-SCM) to uncover major trends, understand how academic research is aligned with business practice, and find out existing gaps. Through text mining and topic modeling of 1148 full-text research papers and 5130 news articles, major themes within each domain, their patterns of evolution over time, and the depth and breadth of their associations were identified. Mapping analyses were also conducted based on the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model and the main SCM research streams to further explore existing knowledge gaps. The findings revealed that BT-enabled supply chain asset management, BT-enabled reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chain, and actual versus anticipated performance outcomes of BT-SCM are among important pathways for future research. The findings also highlighted where there is more need to enhance the practical relevance of BT-SCM research considering advances in business adoption. The paper provides a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of the BT-SCM knowledge landscape and a taxonomy of the research questions related to the technical and managerial aspects of BT-SCM that are particularly useful for the community of researchers in the field. It offers a practical framework that can be applied to assess the academic literature on other emerging technologies in SCM where state-of-the-practice is key to guiding research efforts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

This tendency has implications also in the food logistics industry. This study addresses a single-period closed Inventory Routing Problem under environmental and social sustainability concerns in daily food logistics systems. In particular, the study focuses on reducing CO2 emissions in a refrigerated transportation system, collecting and disposing of waste, and offering employees more enticing work schedules, that have not been simultaneously addressed in the literature. The problem has been mathematically defined as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model. A solution approach based on a clustering algorithm has been proposed to solve large-sized cases. The applicability of the proposed decision support models and the potential practical benefits obtained from their use are shown by performing numerical analyses on an industrial case and a set of larger instances. The results show that simultaneously respecting workforce constraints, waste collection/disposal, and demand uncertainty provide improved economic, environmental and social outputs for food logistics companies. Due to workforce constraints, the delivery time is shortened by 5.5 h, which allow the manufacturing to start later. Respecting waste collection and disposal as well as demand uncertainty enables cost reductions of %40.9 and %6, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Automated driving has been gaining importance in the commercial vehicle industry and trucks with SAE L4 are expected by 2030 for the hub-to-hub scenario. Driven by the research question of what the direct logistics environment of automated trucks will look like in 2030 a two-round Delphi-based scenario study was conducted for domestic goods transport in Germany. 19 projections were developed and evaluated by 27 experts from different industries. With complete-linkage clustering, four logistics scenarios for 2030 were created. The results show that environmental and social sustainability as well as digitalization are expected to be the most important drivers. These include the shift to electric drive systems, improved working conditions, and increasing transparency and connectivity of the supply chain. The experts forecast an increase in the importance of software services and a continuing shortage of skilled workers. Rather controversial are the topics of charging infrastructure for electrified transport and the degree of automation of loading systems. Overall, the results provide a reliable basis for strategic decision-making in order to ensure the introduction of automated trucks into the logistics of the future and their surrounding environment. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research aims to provide a conceptual framework with the scope to assist in establishing sustainable supply chain clusters (SCCs) by providing an instrument for organisations to enhance the three sustainability dimensions in a dynamic environment. Design/methodology/approach: This research proposes a conceptual framework to enhance sustainability and organisational performance through three theoretical lenses: the system theory, extended resource-based view and the dynamic capabilities (DCs) theory. This approach is carried out through a comprehensive review of the existing literature on SCCs. Findings: Four main propositions are formulated and demonstrated using the developed framework, which expands the discussion about SCCs and their key characteristics in a dynamic environment. This is particularly relevant as it allows empirical testing of the theories in an SCC context. Research limitations/implications: It can be noted that more extensive research is needed to further understand the issues faced in establishing sustainable clusters. Drawing on the theoretical lenses to establish the framework helps to enhance the understanding and operational capabilities of sustainable SCCs during and after disruptions, such as the global disruption created by COVID-19. Practical implications: This research paves the way to help organisations improve their adaptability to the dynamic business environment by emphasizing the importance of clustering and linking it to sustainability through DCs to establish a sustainable cluster. Originality/value: This research aims to guide organisations' use of SCCs as tools to enhance sustainability in a dynamic environment, given that the relationship amongst supply chain cluster design characteristics (SCCDCs), DCs and sustainability remains unexplored. The combination of the three theoretical lenses in developing the proposed framework will assist in further understanding the applicability of these theories when they are considered together. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The fruit supply chain (FSC) involves different stages that need to be planned at least two months in advance. Therefore, having a good fruit yield forecast with anticipation allows making timely correct decisions for providing the resources, transport, and cold storage contracts, among others. Therefore, fruit yield over or underestimation could cause important inefficiencies with regards to FSC. Because of its relevance, a method based on machine learning (ML) techniques that uses spectrometric vegetation data is proposed. This method, known as Spectrometry Based Method for Fruit Production Forecast (SBM-Fruit), allows exploring the georeferenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), collected in different phenological stages, aiming to capture spatial and temporal dependency in the fruit yield forecast. In the first step of SBM-Fruit, several clusters are obtained in a clustering process using the georeferenced NDVI in all phenological stages as input, while, in the second step, two validation functions are used for determining the best clustering. Finally, in the third step, the predictor variables of the best clustering are incorporated into an artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting the fruit yield. The SBM-Fruit was applied to forecast table grape yield of an orchard located in the Valparaíso Region, Chile. The results show fruit yield estimations with mean errors around 0.013 percent for every spatial zone of the orchard, forecasted at least two months in advance. The use of the SBM-Fruit would allow FSC stakeholders to make better decisions, improving the coordination of the FSC stages, and reducing costs and fruit losses. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Timely yield prediction is crucial for the agri-food supply chain as a whole. However, different stakeholders in the agri-food sector require different levels of accuracy and lead times in which a yield prediction should be available. For the producers, predictions during the growing season are essential to ensure that information is available early enough for the timely implementation of agronomic decisions, while industries can wait until later in the season to optimize their production process and increase their production traceability. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms, dynamic and static predictors, and a phenology approach to determine the time for issuing the yield prediction. In addition, the effect of data reduction was evaluated by comparing results obtained with and without principal component analysis (PCA). Gaussian process regression (GPR) was the best for predicting maize yield. Its best performance (nRMSE of 13.31%) was obtained late in the season and with the full set of predictors (vegetation indices, meteorological and soil predictors). In contrast, neural network (NNET) and support vector machines linear basis function (SVMl) achieved their best accuracy with only vegetation indices and at the tasseling phenological stage. Only slight differences in performance were observed between the algorithms considered, highlighting that the main factors influencing performance are the timing of the yield prediction and the predictors with which the machine learning algorithms are fed. Interestingly, PCA was instrumental in increasing the performances of NNET after this stage. An additional benefit of the application of PCA was the overall reduction between 12 and 30.20% in the standard deviation of the maize yield prediction performance from the leave one-year outer-loop cross-validation, depending on the feature set. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Green energy production has gained significance during recent years due to the Paris agreement considering carbon emissions. One of the leading sources of energy production in the aforementioned aspects is wind energy. Even though the service life of a wind turbine (WT) is considered long (20–40 years), it is expected to confront a significant number of end-of-life (EOL) WTs in the medium term. In order to acquire maximum value, operations for EOL WTs have a crucial place. These operations are mainly referred as recycling, decommissioning, remanufacturing, and disposal. There are several key factors confronted during these processes such as transportation, center attendance, route decision, integration into circular economy, and disassembly of WTs etc. Therefore, a sustainable process is required for dealing with WTs at the EOL in order to maximize the environmental benefits of wind power and value creation. A comprehensive literature review was conducted in this study in order to accomplish the aforementioned aim, demonstrate the state-of-art-applications, and detect gaps. Almost 530 studies, which were conducted till January of 2022, are taken into consideration in the proposed study. According to the results of the implemented analysis in the proposed study, the examined studies focused on WT blade integration into the circular economy, regulations, mechanical properties of recycled materials, supply chain issues, and so on. However, total life cycle assessment is not entirely considered as a whole. In addition, some critical gaps in the literature are detected, which are given as follows: combining the entire dismantling and repowering, investigating the variables that can help or hinder WT recovery in the long run, requirement for investigating the roles of technological breakthroughs, regulatory measures, and incentives in renewable technology investment and production, and infrastructure and transportation data must be factored in to solve location allocation difficulties for disposal or disassembly plants. The proposed literature review consists of three main parts; the first part demonstrates bibliometric analysis of considered literature. The second part includes the descriptive analysis, and the third part comprehends the details of the received studies. In the third part, a detailed analysis of the studies is conducted. In the fourth part, interpretation of examined studies is proposed. At the end, gaps in the considered literature are detected and proposals for potential study subjects are indicated. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Global e-commerce sales are growing rapidly adding complexities to their supply chains. There are an increasing trend of product returns along with the growth of global e-commerce platforms, placing a huge significance on reverse logistics management. E-commerce being a competitive industry, factors such as environmental concerns, customer awareness, and legal pressure have led the firms to pay attention to the circular economy and sustainability concepts while managing their reverse logistics. Considering the above factors, this paper proposes a three-stage, circular reverse logistics framework for handling e-commerce returns. We introduce a novel method of applying ward-like hierarchical clustering with geographical constraints on returns data to identify return patterns as the first stage. As the second stage, a circular economy network was introduced among different parties to commit towards the circular economy. We develop a mixed integer linear programming model upon the above circular economy network in the third stage to capture different facets of the reverse logistics in e-commerce and optimize the network. At the final stage, the model is validated with a case study based on an e-commerce firm engaged in consumer electrical and electronics. The decision support system which is an output of this study will help the decision makers in e-commerce firms to embrace circular economy and optimize the reverse logistics network, while handling product returns. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The smart manufacturing industry has witnessed a rapid increase in data generation due to the integration of sensors, IoT devices, and other advanced technologies. With this huge amount of data, the need for efficient data processing methods becomes critical for identifying anomalies in real-time. With the rise of Industry 4.0 practices, digitally enabled manufacturing units are shifting their focus towards Smart Manufacturing paradigm for better productivity, throughput and increased business volume. Traditionally digital manufacturing units have considered different AI approaches like Neural Network, Statistical Methods, Deep Learning etc. to detect and predict anomalies in their production lines. But with the Smart Manufacturing ecosystem, a manufacturing unit must integrate manufacturing intelligence in real-time across entire production lines through sensor data of IOT devices. Hence the traditional anomaly detection systems fall short to respond well, under the changed scenario, where large volumes of unstructured and varied types of data are being generated at high velocity, to be processed at (soft) real time. The article reviews the current state-of-the-art in big data processing for anomaly detection in smart manufacturing. The review covers various aspects such as data collection, data processing, anomaly detection, and real-time monitoring. The current paper also proposes a novel stateful data streaming computational model for big data processing in smart manufacturing units which conceptually lays the foundation on top of which any discrete anomaly detection engine would be able to work. The proposed architecture has several benefits, including its ability to handle the large volume, velocity, and variety of data generated in smart manufacturing. The architecture can be applied to various smart manufacturing applications, including predictive maintenance, quality control, and supply chain optimization. It is expected that this proposed architecture will pave the way for the development of more efficient and effective smart manufacturing systems in the future. © 2023 The authors.},

This is especially true in data centers’ function as energy vacuums and in their carbon and extractive footprints and other environmental externalities. I demonstrate that data centers organize an assemblage of environmental relations whose operations reproduce uneven systems of capitalism enacted through energy and environmental politics.

	abstract = {Purpose: Data-driven quality management systems, brought about by the implementation of digitisation and digital technologies, is an integral part of improving supply chain management performance. The purpose of this study is to determine a methodology to aid the implementation of digital technologies and digitisation of the supply chain to enable data-driven quality management and the reduction of waste from manufacturing processes. Design/methodology/approach: Methodologies from both the quality management and data science disciplines were implemented together to test their effectiveness in digitalising a manufacturing process to improve supply chain management performance. The hybrid digitisation approach to process improvement (HyDAPI) methodology was developed using findings from the industrial use case. Findings: Upon assessment of the existing methodologies, Six Sigma and CRISP-DM were found to be the most suitable process improvement and data mining methodologies, respectively. The case study revealed gaps in the implementation of both the Six Sigma and CRISP-DM methodologies in relation to digitisation of the manufacturing process. Practical implications: Valuable practical learnings borne out of the implementation of these methodologies were used to develop the HyDAPI methodology. This methodology offers a pragmatic step by step approach for industrial practitioners to digitally transform their traditional manufacturing processes to enable data-driven quality management and improved supply chain management performance. Originality/value: This study proposes the HyDAPI methodology that utilises key elements of the Six Sigma DMAIC and the CRISP-DM methodologies along with additions proposed by the author, to aid with the digitisation of manufacturing processes leading to data-driven quality management of operations within the supply chain. © 2021, Rose Clancy, Dominic O'Sullivan and Ken Bruton.},

	abstract = {The chemical industry has growing importance in sustainability because of the potential adverse effects on the environment. Also, stakeholders emphasize many social issues besides environmental protection for the chemical industry. Relying on a solid supplier base has become the main prerequisite for chemical manufacturers to achieve environmental targets and fulfill stakeholders' expectations while remaining competitive. This study develops the Integrated Sustainable Supplier Evaluation & Development Framework (ISSED-F) to support chemical manufacturers with managing supplier relationships according to the economic, environmental, and social facets of sustainability. Although the literature is rife with evaluation models aiming to fulfill the supplier selection tasks, these models mostly ignore the developmental role of supplier evaluation. To remedy this gap, ISSED-F adopts a deductive and holistic approach from setting the criteria to setting the measurement structure, evaluating the suppliers, and developing the suppliers. Materiality analysis, Analytic Network Process (ANP), Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE), and cluster analysis are the fundamental methods that constitute the ISSED-F structure. A case study presents the use of the ISSED-F in a transnational chemical manufacturer's supplier relationship management (SRM) process. The case company evaluates 69 suppliers and assigns development strategies to the relevant performance segments within the implementation. The successful implementation of ISSED-F shows that it can be a roadmap for chemical manufacturers to adopt sustainability practices and ensure continuous development in their supply chains. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

In this regard, the present paper proposes a new multi-objective model for the Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) problems by incorporating lot sizing and considering lean, agility, and sustainability factors, simultaneously. Furthermore, a robust possibilistic programming approach was applied for handling the uncertainty of the model. To increase the responsiveness of the system, a Fuzzy C-means Clustering Method (FCCM) was employed in order to select the potential locations based on the proximity to local customers. A new hybrid metaheuristic algorithm was developed in order to improve efficiency of the model in dealing with large-size problems and assess the impact of using a single-based initial solution as the income for the second phase of the proposed hybrid algorithm. In addition, to ensure effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, another well-known metaheuristic algorithm was developed. The results achieved by experiments on different test problems approved the superiority of the hybrid metaheuristic algorithm in achieving proper solutions. © 2022 Sharif University of Technology.

A model was developed that can quantify the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of each patient (the effectiveness) and the manufacturing cost of the cells (the cost indicator). Agent-based modeling was applied to consider the individual condition of each patient and to convert the input parameters of disease, annual number of treated patients, treatment mode (e.g., young people prioritized), and treatment period to the output indicators. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, the total manufacturing cost per one DALY was defined as the indicator. The model was then applied to the analysis of allogeneic hiPS cell therapy for three diseases that are undergoing clinical studies in Japan. The results indicated that when the number of treated patients is small, the treatment mode needs to be discussed carefully. Also, the type of supply chain network should be chosen between centralized or distributed considering the cryopreservation tolerance of the cells. To provide the first estimate of cost effectiveness from the manufacturing perspective, the number of required cells and the patient age were suggested as a proxy. © 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

	abstract = {Fashion is a global, multi-trillion dollar industry devoted to producing and selling clothing, footwear, and accessories to individuals or groups of people. Its sheer numbers, together with social and environmental sustainability concerns, and the move towards digitalization of customer-centric operations, make the fashion business a prime target for Decision Support Systems (DSSs). On the other hand, decision support in fashion retail is particularly problematic and embraces all major supply chain domains. Decisions in an online fashion retail supply chain (FRSC) are highly dependent on time-varying customers' preferences and product availability, often leading to a combinatorial explosion. To address such a problem, DSSs could greatly benefit from high-quality information stored in customer models (CMs), constructed by using Artificial Intelligence techniques, allowing informed decisions on how to personalize (adapt) to match the customer's needs and preferences. Combinations of CMs with recommender systems (RSs) have been increasingly utilized in fashion e-commerce to provide personalized product recommendations. Nevertheless, works on enhancing CMs for e-commerce or other decision-making chain domains are scanty. This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on fashion CMs with applications to decision-making in FRSCs, mining topics for a research agenda. Research on the theme is relevant and urgent for the fashion business, which is still in its infancy. Work on the agenda topics could benefit distinct fashion stakeholders, not just customers, and produce well-grounded decision-making in varied FRSC contexts and dynamics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Identifying and assessing these risk factors is the most significant phase in supply chain risk management (SCRM). The earlier risk quantification methods make timely decision-making more complex due to their inability to provide early warning. The paper aims to propose a model for analyzing the social media data to understand the potential SC risk factors in real-time. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the potential of text-mining, one of the most popular Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based data analytics approaches for extracting information from social media is exploited. The model retrieves the information using Twitter streaming API from online SC forums. Findings: The potential risk factors that disrupt SC performance are obtained from the recent data by text-mining analyses. The outcomes carry valuable insights about some contemporary SC issues due to the pandemic during the year 2021. The most frequent risk factors using rule mining techniques are also analyzed. Originality/value: This study presents the significant role of Twitter in real-time risk identification from online SC platforms like “Supply Chain Dive”, “Supply Chain Brain” and “Supply Chain Digest”. The results indicate the significant role of data analytics in achieving accurate decision-making.

	abstract = {Abstract: We consider belief propagation (BP) as an efficient and scalable tool for state estimation and optimization problems in supply networks such as power grids. BP algorithms make use of factor graph representations, whose assignment to the problem of interest is not unique. It depends on the state variables and their mutual interdependencies. Many short loops in factor graphs may impede the accuracy of BP. We propose a systematic way to cluster loops of naively assigned factor graphs such that the resulting transformed factor graphs have no additional loops as compared to the original network. They guarantee an accurate performance of BP with only slightly increased computational effort, as we demonstrate by a concrete and realistic implementation for power grids. The method outperforms existing alternatives to handle the loops. We point to other applications to supply networks such as gas-pipeline or other flow networks that share the structure of constraints in the form of analogues to Kirchhoff’s laws. Whenever small and abundant loops in factor graphs are systematically generated by constraints between variables in the original network, our factor-graph assignment in BP complements other approaches. It provides a fast and reliable algorithm to perform marginalization in tasks like state determination, estimation, or optimization issues in supply networks.

	abstract = {Supply chain management (SCM) integrates all links and business processes involved in the supply chain through the information management system. Applying artificial intelligence algorithms to the SCM system can realize the visualization, automation, and intelligent management of all links in the supply chain. This can effectively help enterprises reduce operating costs and improve their ability to respond to market demands, thereby increasing overall operational efficiency. An effective member selection method is an important basis for smooth dynamic supply chain operation. To address the problem of high numbers of decision attributes and low numbers of data samples for decision analysis, this paper proposes a dynamic supply chain member selection algorithm based on conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs). To ensure that classification performance will not be reduced, the member classification method on the chain can successfully reduce the data dimension and complexity in the classification process. Furthermore, machine learning is used for analyzing and predicting purchase and inventory links in the supply chain. For the vehicle scheduling module, the path is reasonably planned to improve the operation efficiency. The integrated implementation of the SCM system is finalized using the SSH framework. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The traditional global food supply chains are not just complex, but they do not support the sustainability of agriculture. The business models with the greatest growth potential are those that would allow consumers to buy more directly from producers. Before COVID-19, these alternatives were not just popular but had a relatively high market share compared to post COVID-19 era. However, due to the pandemic and the changes in consumers’ purchasing behavior, the players of short food supply chains had to adapt to the new circumstances. This is why business model innovation is nowadays a priority, which means a substantial renewal of the value delivered to customers, and a significant transformation of the processes and activities of the company/network. The study aimed to examine the dynamic innovation through applied digital marketing solutions that could open up new sales channels and increase the competitiveness of the companies involved. Since Austria is one of the “greenest” countries, its consumers are interested in purchasing sustainably, so they strive to buy directly from the producers. This motivates the authors to use its representative sample to investigate how well adapted the Austrian direct sellers are to the unsteady circumstances. Based on a previous research framework, a principal component analysis was applied and the elements defined therein were the variables of non-hierarchical clustering. The used methods highlight the lack of online distribution and marketing of the farmer shops, which could multiply the harmful effects of the pandemic. The classification of the shops demonstrated the generally low share of innovative direct sellers. We conclude that in the new era, businesses that effectively apply open business innovation models will be able to compete in the market. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A fresh product supply chain is considered in which an omnichannel retailer procures products from multiple suppliers and distributes them through a distribution center to physical stores to serve both online and offline customers. A two-stage stochastic optimization model is formulated for the strategic and operational decisions of the omnichannel retailer incorporating the decision maker's risk aversion behavior and financial flow into supply chain optimization. In the model, the amount of capital possessed by the retailer is treated as a hard constraint, and trade credit and bank loans are both considered as financial sources. After linearization, the two-stage stochastic optimization model is transformed into a mixed integer linear programming model. A hybrid robust and stochastic optimization approach is developed to simultaneously cope with two different types of uncertainties in the supply chain by including stochastic scenarios for transportation costs and using “interval + polyhedral” uncertainty sets for demands and deterioration rate. The robust counterpart of the mixed integer linear programming model is constructed. An improved sample average approximation method using the k-means clustering technique is adopted to solve the problem. The applicability of the proposed model and the efficiency of the solution approach are investigated through numerical studies. Some important managerial insights are provided through the model, the solution approach and the numerical studies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that enables decentralized applications (DApps) such as hyperledger, bitcoin,ethereum, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible token (NFT) to operate on it. Bitcoin is a popular application that leverages blockchain technology (BT) to provide secure transactions in a decentralized environment. Among the main reasons for BT being utilized is to eliminate the dependence of the process on third parties such as lawyers, insurance firms, and banks to execute approvals, verifications, and signatures. Due to the immutability and transparency of this technology, it has been deployed in several industries, including agri-food, supply chain, automotive, pharma, healthcare, insurance, land registration, and higher education, to increase verification, security, and traceability. Modern research indicates that blockchain distributed ledger may still be susceptible to various privacy,security, and dependability challenges, despite their impressive characteristics. To resolve these challenges, it is essential to notice abnormal behavior in a timely manner. Consequently, machine learning (ML) approach with anomaly detection play a comprehensive role in preventing fraud. This paper explores the technological integration of anomaly detection models into BT and compares supervised and unsupervised ML techniques for detecting rogue and legitimate transactions. The studies for the review come from three well-known databases: Web of Science (WoS), Google Scholar and Scopus. Using sophisticated search tactics, specialized keywords such as bitcoin, ethereum, blockchain, fraud detection, anomaly detection, data mining, and ML are employed. These findings are based on three main points (1) the background of BT (2) Blockchain integration with ML, and (3) the ML approach for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. According to the findings of this study, supervised learning is the most prevalent method for studying anomalous detection in blockchain networks. This study also equips researchers with the knowledge necessary to perform research on the detection of blockchain network anomalies using ML techniques. © 2022 Sabri Hisham et al.},

	abstract = {With the introduction of new COVID-19 variants such as Delta and Omicron, small businesses have been tasked with navigating a constantly changing business environment. Furthermore, due to supply chain issues, shortages of various critical products negatively affect businesses of all sizes and industries. However, continued innovation in Computer Science, specifically in sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as natural language processing (NLP), has created significant value for businesses through helpful data-driven features. To this end, we propose a platform utilizing AI-driven tools to help build an effective business-to-business (B2B) platform. The proposed platform aims to automate much of the market research which goes into selecting products and platform users during times of distress while still providing an intuitive e-commerce interface. There are three primary novel components to this platform. The first of these components is the Buyer’s Club (BC), which allows customers to pool resources to purchase bulk orders at a reduced cost. The second component is an automated system utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect trending disaster news topics. Disaster topic detection can be applied to inform buyers and suppliers on adapting to changing market conditions and has been shown to match closely with Google Trends data. The third component is a regulation matching system, using a custom data set to help inform customers when purchasing products. Such guidance is necessary to comply with a regulatory environment that will be irregular for the foreseeable future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Second, the risk transmission is generally from the petrochemical sector to the coal sector; while the risk transmission in each sector mainly spills from upstream to the downstream products. Third, “methanol - polyethylene” bridges the coal sector and petrochemical sector, through which the link between the two sectors has been strengthened since the outbreak of COVID-19. Fourth, the systemic risk of the energy market has increased, and several commodities have experienced a role reversal in the network since the pandemic began, especially in the petrochemical sector. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Nonetheless, the bulk of the recently deployed partition approaches overlooked the question of whether the district’s fluctuation regulation of flow data is consistent. When the district is modified, it most likely leads to an increase in pressure at a node. To tackle the problem, the flow data from a city’s water supply network was evaluated in this article. The random forest approach was also used to extract time-domain characteristics from flow data, and the water supply network split was optimized using the random forest-hierarchical clustering (RF-HC) strategy. Finally, the results were examined and compared. The results suggest that the RF-HC-based water supply network partition technique can better meet the aim of consistent flow changes in the district, as well as offer a theoretical foundation and technological support for the optimal dispatch of press concerning the water supply network. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Reducing emission of conventional vehicle exhaust has many benefits for developing low-carbon cities. The transition from on-road conventional passenger cars to Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (HFCVs) may enhance air quality and health significantly. Aiming at constructing low-cost and environmentally friendly hydrogen supply networks (HSNs) in urban areas, a basic model that considers hydrogen plant and refueling station decisions is presented for the Two-level Hydrogen Supply Network Design (THSND) with stochastic demand. By coupling the basic model and carbon regulations, four extended models are established to evaluate carbon reduction on total cost of HSNs. A data-driven approach that does not require the full information of target areas is developed to solve the models. It introduces a data acquisition method of Points of Interests (POIs), a clustering-based method to select alternative refueling stations, a trip simulation method to determine demand uncertainty, and the application of solvers. The developed data-driven approach is shown to be robust and effective in terms of applicability and generalizability according to the simulations. Meanwhile, the best suitable decision result on plants and stations is both cost-effective and environmentally successful under the model considering carbon cap and trade. The internal relationship between the models indicates that the hybrid carbon emission policy is superior to naive carbon regulations. © 2022},

	abstract = {The research agenda on smart cities has increasingly extended not only on perspectives of social–economic relations between technologies and cities but also on the industrial economic ecosystem. The purpose of this study is to focus on an analytical method for the characteristics of a smart city’s ecology and industry. With that thought, we have developed a smart SPIN (Spectrum, Penetration, Impact and Network) model and applied it to analyze the ecology of the Korean smart city industry in general. This model consists of smart spectrum model, smart penetration model, smart impact path model and smart network clustering model. The smart SPIN model shows great potential as an analytical method for the smart city industry ecosystem. As a source of data for analyses from 1960, 1985 and 2015 via input–output table, we revised these data into 25 and 8 industries related to the smart city ecosystem. Additionally, we applied the 2015 GDP deflator. The results of analysis are as follows: First, spectrum, the number of smart industries is increasing. This means that the smart city industry scope and area are expanding. Second, analysis of the smart penetration model and smart ecological industry can be applied into other industries. In other words, traditional industries can crossover and utilize smart technology. Third, with the results of our analysis of the smart impact path model, production paths are increasing while parameter paths did not show a triple parameter path. This means the value chain of the smart city industry is highly divested, but the structure of the industry is weakening. Fourth, smart network analysis shows important clusters to be centered on traditional industries: the clusters do not appear in smart industry centers. This means the impact of the smart city is not strong. Our analysis shows that, today, the Korean industrial ecosystem of smart cities is interacting with existing industries and raising it to a more intelligent and smarter level. Thus, there is a need for this kind of analysis study in order to find optimized smart city industry ecosystem. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: It became a fact, and the world's countries went under confinement due to the pandemic of the Covid19. There are severe impacts on tourism with the supply chain experiencing a full pause. This research investigates the influence of governance, media coverage, crisis severity, former travel practice and Covid-19 incidences on the perceived risk related to travel and tourism during the pandemic and in cross-countries. Design/methodology/approach: We collected the data from a sample of 1845 individuals from more than 12 countries and four continents representing quarantined and most impacted areas in the world in March and April 2020. A multilevel linear model was applied to predict the perceived risk across countries as a level 2 research unit. Findings: The finding confirms the clustering in the data with media coverage, governance and crisis growth affecting the outcome. There are cross-level interaction effects, as the growth rate of the pandemic per country and media coverage impact tourists' perception of risk. Finally, there are lower-level direct effects, with lower-level variables affecting tourists' perceived risks. Research limitations/implications: The survey is randomly administered online due to the nearly complete quarantine implemented in the studied areas. Besides, and considering the latter, the responses might have been subjective due to the non-containment of the crisis by the study's time, directing to possible alteration of feelings and responses from respondents. This leads to suggest a future extension of this research, similarly, post-crisis. Originality/value: This research pinpointed the impacts of predictors, concerning the countries' level, during the crisis phase on the perceived risk. Therefore, it gives insights into professional bodies on future concerns to be considered during the recovery phase. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {A buyer firm can increase collaboration in its buyer-supplier relational (BSR) network by focussing on supplier-to-supplier interconnectivity (i.e., network density) or alternatively, by enabling supplier clustering. While the extant literature has considered the effects of these two strategies on firm financial performance, it has not shown whether a focal firm's buyer-supply network collaboration strategy affects its sustainable firm performance (SFP), specifically its environmental and economic performance. This paper investigates three key questions: (a) How do collaboration strategies influence SFP? (b) Is there an optimal mix of these two network strategies for fostering collaboration in a firm's BSR network? (c) Can a manager win on both environmental and economic frontiers by pursuing either strategy? Leveraging extant research on BSR networks, ambidexterity, and network theory, we propose a model linking collaboration strategies to SFP. We construct 330 multi-tier BSR networks and find strong support for the non-linear effects of both collaboration strategies on SFP. A response function analysis identifies the combination of strategies yielding the best outcome for SFP. We also find strong evidence for trade-offs between the performance variables. The results show that managers should focus on density as a lever while developing a minimal level of supplier clustering. We discuss academic and managerial implications of our findings for managing buyer-supplier relationships and enhancing a firm's performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Although brands are making efforts to improve packaging sustainability as demands for low-impact packaging are rising, there is a lack of empirical evidence of innovative packaging solutions among fashion retailers. This study represents the first global report on sustainable packaging innovation in the fashion sector. A data-mining approach was utilized to gather a sample of 400 international fashion brands that advertise sustainable packaging solutions across five continents. The sustainability of the packaging solution was evaluated for each brand based on three factors: sustainability mission, the availability of packaging data, and the actual sustainability of the package. The results showed that 57% of brands have made evident progress in the sustainable packaging area; 34% of brands have initiated the transition from conventional to improved packaging; the remaining brands have committed to rethink (1%) or to improve (8%) their packaging in the future. By providing comprehensive state-of-the-art evidence about practical achievements in the sustainable packaging field, this global report intends to help academics and practitioners to evaluate the environmental, social, and economic impacts of existing packaging products and to design circular packaging that minimizes these impacts. © 2022 by the authors.},

Despite these significant economic impacts, understanding of the interconnection between rainfall patterns in the region is still currently limited. Here, we analyzed the spatial dependence of the rainfall patterns of 24 megacities in the region using complex analysis theory and discussed the technique's applicability. Each city and rainfall similarity were represented by a node and a link, respectively. Vital-node identification and clustering analysis were conducted using adjacency information entropy and multiresolution community detection. The results of vital-node identification analysis show that high-ranking nodes are cities that are located near main vapor providers in East Asia. Using multiresolution community detection, the groups were clustered to reflect the spatial characteristics of the climate. In addition, the climate links between each group were identified using cross-mutual information considering the delay time for each group. We found a strong bond between Northeast China and the southern Indochinese Peninsula and verified that the links between each group originated from the summer climate characteristics of East Asia. The results of the study show that complex network analysis could be a valuable method for analyzing the spatial relationships between climate factors.  © Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Blood transfusion is a continuous demand, as it is widely required for many medical surgeries and critical operations. Therefore, there is a need to manage the whole process of supplying blood from blood donors to the hospitals and transfusion centers. Many researchers were recently interested in the operations and supply chain management of blood products, they considered the operations and supply chain management of blood products for the purpose of minimizing the blood wastage. As a result of the the inverse relationship between blood donations and blood products demand, more occasional blood shortages can be expected. This research proposes an intelligent system that entails the recruitment of donors that are available to donate blood products on a short notice. The proposed system optimizes the blood donation process by preventing blood shortages and minimizing the wastage of blood units with regards to expiration, and proves promising results. A set of optimization equations have been built for optimizing the process of blood donation to reduce the blood wastage and prevent blood shortage. It considers as well the new insights from the medical literature on the deterioration of stored blood products, as the use of older red blood cells is linked to poorer clinical outcomes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Goal of this study is to extract information about the profile of travel agency customers who buy or do not buy daily tours, by using classification technique of data mining method. In accordance with this goal, data regarding reservations and daily tours’ operations from one incoming travel agency operating in Antalya in Turkey were used. Total data set consisted of 9972 hotel reservations, represented by 30 different variables. After evaluation of 11 different algorithms, the C4.5 algorithm was applied, since it showed the best performance in discovering customer profiles. Results showed that the groups that purchase daily tours differ according to the region where the tour is sold and that age group and tourist type (family, group, single, etc.) are related to daily tour-purchasing decisions. In general, it was detected that young guests tend to participate in daily tours, while middle-aged and elderly ones mostly prefer to attend shopping and entertainment tours.

This paper proposes a data-driven chance-constrained programming approach to address this issue and guarantee the benefit of the refinery value chain. First, the blending effect model is introduced to capture the uncertainties in component properties, where the blending effect value is estimated from historical process data by the recursive least-squares (RLS). Second, a chance-constrained gasoline blending model is proposed to ensure the on-specification products with a high probability in uncertain environments. Third, the Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs) are employed to generate blending effect data unsupervised. Fourth, a scenario-based approach is used to reformulate the chance-constrained gasoline blending problem based on sufficient generated data. Accounting for the complexity of the resulting large-scale optimization, a sequential algorithm is applied to reduce the computational cost. Finally, an industrial case study of gasoline blending is presented to demonstrate its applicability. © 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

Non-destructive turmeric adulteration detection is a challenging research area. The existing adulteration detection processes are largely instrumental and analytical with high accuracy but include limitations like long testing time, expensiveness, and lack of mobility. This work reports a new computer vision framework, which can simultaneously detect the presence of adulteration and predict the possible percentage of adulteration addressing the stated limitations. The scope has been remained to screening of Sudan dye-I adulteration in turmeric powder. An in-house database prepared with images of pure and adulterated turmeric powder samples has been used for experimentation. Random Forest algorithm has been employed for both classification and prediction. The model has been validated with standard internal and external validation methods to assess the stability and generalization potential of the model to avoid over- and under-fitting problems. The results of classification show that the presented framework can provide more than 99% accuracy in detection while high correlation coefficient (R2) value in the tune of.99 for prediction. The novelty of the work is its simple histogram-based color feature extraction, development of ensemble Random Forest prediction model that resulted in high accuracy and development of a faster, non-invasive, less-expensive, and validated screening method for adulterated turmeric powder that can be considered as a potential immediate screening method in the supply chain of powdered spices prior to confirmatory testing methods following two-tiered food fraud testing approach. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26 held in 2021 concluded a global effort to hasten the energy transition toward a net-zero emission industry. As such, green initiatives, which transition the conventional oil and gas (O&G) sector towards a circular economy (CE) are necessary. In this work, the integration of waste oil re-refining technology is proposed as a potential strategy to enhance the circularity of the O&G industry. A two-step sequential model, which incorporates multiple systematic analytical tools (e.g., multi-objective decision analysis, information entropy, geospatial information, clustering, and routing analysis) is developed to determine: (i) optimal waste oil re-refinery technologies, and (ii) optimal supply chain design, which addresses the location for setting up the process facilities and the delivery routes, with the consideration of both economic and environmental performances. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through a case study in Malaysia (that covers both East and West Malaysia). The analysis showed that the proposed strategy is capable of improving economic and environmental performances by about 9.59% and 46.55%, respectively. This work is essentially a useful reference for decision-makers and policymakers in making nationwide transition planning in the O&G sector. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

New technologies have made considerable improvements in the whole process of inventory management; Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents one of the best options for the industry and their search for more intelligent and robust logistics solutions. Based on a real-world scenario, we approach the challenge of defining delivery routes within a city such that the time they require to be traveled is approximately the same. Moreover, while the routes must ensure that drivers’ workload is time balanced and contract regulations can be met, they also must correspond to a customers’ partition (sectorization) according to well-defined, non-overlapping delivery areas. We introduce an approach to solve the problem through the algorithm HSAC (Hierarchical Simulated Annealing Clustering). The proposed algorithm first applies a divisive approach to the data, using simulated annealing at each step to create time-balanced partitions, and then solves the TSP problem to create optimal routes within the defined groups. Based on real data concerning two Mexican cities, our experimental results show that HSAC can solve the sectorization problem efficiently. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This study investigated the five marketing categories relating to sustainable practices (sustainable marketing, social marketing, green marketing, sustainable consumption and ecological marketing) within core research themes of climate change, global warming and sustainability from a bibliometric approach using the Scopus API. Additional topic modelling was conducted using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) unsupervised approach on downloaded abstracts to distinguish ideas communicated in time through research and publications with co-occurrences of major Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports and Google search queries. The results confirmed marketing strategies aligned with the theme of sustainability with little work from small developing island nations. Additionally, findings demonstrated that research exploring business strategies through green marketing directed to green consumers with sustainable supply chain management had been dominantly increasing in the literature over recent years. Similarly, social marketing associated with green consumers was a common concern for the public and academics, rising over the years with strong influence from the published IPCC Assessment Reports. This study did not explore other published databases, including climate change-related meeting transcripts and published speeches from corporate and world leaders. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {In the past years, research in Social Network Analysis (SNA) has increased. Initially, the research area was limited to sociology and anthropology but has now been used in numerous disciplines. The business and management discipline has many potentials in employing the SNA approach due to enormous relational data, ranging from employees, stakeholders to organisations. The study aims to analyse the research trend, performance, and the utilisation of the SNA approach in business and management research. Bibliometric analysis was conducted by employing 2,158 research data from the Scopus database published from 2001 to 2020. Next, the research quantity and quality were calculated using Harzing's Publish or Perish while VOSviewer visualised research topics and cluster analysis. The study found an upward trend pattern in SNA research since 2005 and reached the peak in 2020. Generally, six subjects under the business and management discipline have used SNA as a methodology tool, including risk management, project management, supply chain management (SCM), tourism, technology and innovation management, and knowledge management. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the study is the first to examine the performance and analysis of SNA in the overall business and management disciplines. The findings provide insight to researchers, academicians, consultants, and other stakeholders on the practical use of SNA in business and management research. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the development of industrial big data, it has become an important research direction to use combinatorial optimization to coordinate multi-objective problems in complex manufacturing scenarios with multiple factories. At present, most of the multi-objective problems are decomposed into single-objective solutions. However, it is difficult to resolve the contradiction between multiple goals. There are many participants in multi-objective problems and complex data types, so there is no suitable research method at present. Based on big data, this paper integrates various aspects of supply chain management of multiple factories, and proposes a DOSTAR combined model. On the one hand, it conducts knowledge discovery based on the fusion of human-cyber-physical ternary data, on the other hand, it conducts multi-objective optimization through knowledge structure. Among them, the most important thing is to establish the six-tuple as the basic model. Then the space weight, time weight and decision weight are obtained through the weight sub-model. Finally, the improved reinforcement learning algorithm is used to extract relevant new knowledge and complete multi-objective coordination. This article takes the supply chain management of Haier water heaters as an example, using the above-mentioned combined model, and the experimental results show that the purpose of improving performance has been achieved. © 2022 The Author(s)},

The timely outcomes with high quality and desired cost that directly affect customer satisfaction have an important place in many organizations, including banks. In the last decade, as an emerging technique for business processes management, process mining has been applied in many domains, including manufacturing, supply chain, government, healthcare, and software engineering. There are limited number of studies on process mining techniques carried out for the software process, especially in the banking sector. A lack of tool infrastructure enabling to run the entire software development process and the challenges in integrating processed data from separated varying tools and assets complicate the use of process mining for software processes. This paper aims to identify the improvement points in the software development process of the Kuveyt Turk Participation Bank in Turkey through the surfacing actions. The findings and results are gathered by the application of process mining techniques of bupaR, and evaluation is provided by experts in the bank.

	abstract = {As the world is moving into a sustainable era, achieving zero hunger has become one of the top three Sustainable Development Goals, applying a considerable amount of pressure on the agri-food systems to make decisions contemplating the sustainability dimensions. Accordingly, making effective supply chain decisions holistically while achieving sustainability goals has become a major challenge faced by the present agri-food systems. Thus, to address the challenge, a novel supply chain configuration addressing multiple supply chain decisions to reduce global warming potential (GWP) and post-harvest losses have been presented by taking the banana supply chain in Sri Lanka as a case study. In the proposed approach, farmers have been clustered based on their geo positions using K-Means clustering followed by route planning within clusters using a heuristics approach. Retailer points are catered by assigning to wholesalers optimally modeling as an assignment model and then route planning executed using a heuristic approach. The solution generated from the above approaches has been implemented on a simulation platform to calculate the overall supply chain performance including the transportation component, in terms of the net GWP, post-harvest losses, and lead time including routing operations. Simulated supply chain performance has been compared with the existing system and verified the performance of the proposed supply chain configuration. The suggested configuration has reduced the net GWP by 15.3%, post-harvest loss by 2.1%, lead time by 28.2%, and travel distance by 20.47%. The proposed configuration can be further improved by adding dynamic characteristics to the model. © 2022 by the authors.},

The increasing use of molecular markers for DNA-based genotype signature is crucial for variety identification and traceability in the food supply chain. We collected 75 Sicilian hazelnut accessions from private and public field collections, including widely grown varieties from the Nebrodi Mountains in north east Sicily (Italy). The germplasm was fingerprinted through nine standardized microsatellites (SSR) for hazelnut identification to evaluate the genetic diversity of the collected accessions, validating SSR discrimination power. We identified cases of homonymy and synonymy among acquisitions and the unique profiles. The genetic relationships illustrated by hierarchical clustering, structure, and discriminant analyses revealed a clear distinction between local and commercial varieties. The comparative genetic analysis also showed that the Nebrodi genotypes are significantly different from the Northern Italian, Iberian, and Turkish geno-types. These results highlight the need and urgency to preserve Nebrodi germplasm as a useful and valuable source for traits of interest employable for breeding.

	abstract = {Recommender systems have widely been used in the past few years as a recipe to success in e-commerce. Already, 35 percent of what consumers purchase on Amazon and 75 percent of what they watch on Netflix come from product recommendation (MacKenzie et al. in How retailers can keep up with consumers. Technical report. McKinsey & Company, London, 2013). However, in the context of high-end products such as cars, computers, apartments, or financial services, traditional approaches are not the best choice since it is infeasible to collect enough customer behavioral information or feedback over numerous items (Burke et al. in Ai Mag 32:13–8, 2011). Accordingly, since brick and mortar outlets remain the channel of choice for those kinds of products, recommender systems need to adjust to a context in which inventory and customer information are limited. To achieve this goal, we propose a context-aware interactive knowledge-based recommendation to make recommendation to customers who walk into a store, even when no previous information about the customers is available. This technique works in 3 stages: stage 1, contextual pre-filtering, stage 2, interactive exploration and stage 3, constraint-based recommendation. The methodology was developed with an industrial partner in the domain of sport vehicles and is illustrated step by step with an example inspired from this partnership. The proposed method enables an iterative exploration of the products in-store, creates a learning base to learn customers’ interests and recommends a suitable product with regards to logistics, contracts and product’s availability in the network. The method has been tested on our industrial partners’ data and validated by domain experts. This work is a step toward the creation of a continuously evolving learning base of customers’ interests that can be used to adjust sale’s strategy and to develop new products, designs and features that better meet the ever-changing demand of customers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Because of the accessibility of big data collections from consumers, products, and stores, advanced sales forecasting capabilities have drawn great attention from many businesses, especially those in retail, because of the importance of forecasting in decision making. Improvement of forecasting accuracy, even by a small percentage, may have a substantial impact on companies' production and financial planning, marketing strategies, inventory controls, and supply chain management. Specifically, our research goal is to forecast the sales of each product in each store in the near future.Motivated by tensor factorization methodologies for context-aware recommender systems, we propose a novel approach called the advanced temporal latent factor approach to sales forecasting, or ATLAS for short, which achieves accurate and individualized predictions for sales by building a single tensor factorization model across multiple stores and products. Our contribution is a combination of a tensor framework (to leverage information across stores and products), a new regularization function (to incorporate demand dynamics), and extrapolation of the tensor into future time periods using state-of-the-art statistical (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving-average models) and machine-learning (recurrent neural networks) models. The advantages of ATLAS are demonstrated on eight product category data sets collected by Information Resources, Inc., where we analyze a total of 165 million weekly sales transactions of over 15,560 products from more than 1,500 grocery stores. © 2022 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

Problems can occur with the ingestion of messages; if they arrive more quickly than they can be processed, they can cause queue con-gestion. This paper models data interchange (EDI) messages. We sought to understand how best DevOps should model these messages for performance testing and how best to apply smart EDI content awareness that enhance the realms of Ambient Intelligence (Aml) with a Business-to business (B2B) supply chain organisation. We considered key performance indicators (KPI) for over-or under-utilisation of these queueing systems. We modelled message service and inter-arrival times, partitioned data along various axes to facilitate statistical modelling and used continuous parametric and non-parametric techniques. Our results include the best fit for parametric and non-parametric techniques. We noted that a one-size-fits-all model is inappropriate for this heavy-tailed enterprise dataset. Our results showed that parametric distribution models were suitable for modelling the distribution’s tail, whilst non-parametric kernel density estimation models were better suited for modelling the head of a distribution. Depending on how we partitioned our data along the axes, our data suffer from quantisation noise. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Dynamic large-scale multiple attribute group decision making (DLMAGDM) is ubiquitous in many areas of the real world. It is composed of large numbers of decision makers, several continuous periods, alternative set and attribute set changed with time. Given the characteristics implicited in decision-making elements and the advantages of probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) in modelling uncertainty and complexity of decision makers’ subjective opinions, this paper constructs a probabilistic linguistic DLMAGDM method. First of all, a dynamic weight determination model based on trust relationships and evidential conflicts between decision makers is proposed to obtain current dynamic weights of decision makers. Then, a comprehensive hierarchical clustering method that divides large numbers of decision makers into several subgroups is constructed based on three clustering constrains. Moreover, some probabilistic linguistic extended evidential power aggregation operators are proposed to aggregate PLTSs. These operators can appropriately handle the extreme PLTSs and fully consider the role of incomplete probabilistic distributions in PLTSs. In addition, a dynamic decision-making method based on PROMETHEE is developed to determine the final priority order of alternatives according to preferences between alternatives over several periods. Lastly, a case study for supply chain finance risk assessment for several firms in Chinese household appliance industry is utilized to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the probabilistic linguistic DLMAGDM method. Furthermore, the comparative analysis with some other existing methods and the sensitivity analysis are made to verify its advantages. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

The spatial layout of food retail outlets is important for optimizing the urban food system, improving land resource allocation, and encouraging healthy food consumption. Based on food retail POI data, this study employed kernel density estimation, road network centrality, spatial autocorrelation analysis, and locational entropy to analyze the spatial characteristics of supermarkets, produce markets, and small stores in an urban center in Beijing, and explored street coupling and supply-demand matching. The results indicated that within the study area: (1) supermarkets had an obvious “core-periphery” distribution, produce markets had a polycentric distribution, and small stores had a relatively uniform distribution; (2) road network centrality indices revealed a differenti-ated multi-core-edge distribution; (3) streets with high locational entropy values for supermarkets and produce markets were mostly concentrated in the central area, whereas the matching distribution of small stores was relatively balanced. From the perspective of urban planning, policy implications are proposed based on spatial and social equity, urban-rural differences, population structure and distribution status, and a resilient supply chain. The study findings have practical significance for guiding the development of urban food systems in a healthy, just, and sustainable direction, as well as rational urban land planning. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {In recent years, Cyber Physical Production Systems and Digital Threads opened the vision on the importance of data modelling and management to lead the smart factory towards a full-fledged vertical and horizontal integration. Vertical integration refers to the full connection of smart factory levels from the work centers on the shop floor up to the business layer. Horizontal integration is realised when a single smart factory participates in multiple interleaved supply chains with different roles (e.g., main producer, supplier), sharing data and services and forming a Cyber Physical Production Network. In such an interconnected world, data and services become fundamental elements in the cyberspace to implement advanced data-driven applications such as production scheduling, energy consumption optimisation, anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, change management in Product Lifecycle Management, process monitoring and so forth. In this paper, we propose a methodology that guides the design of a portfolio of data-oriented services in a Cyber Physical Production Network. The methodology starts from the goals of the actors in the network, as well as their requirements on data and functions. Therefore, a data model is designed to represent the information shared across actors according to three interleaved perspectives, namely, product, process and industrial assets. Finally, multi-perspective data-oriented services for collecting, monitoring, dispatching and displaying data are built on top of the data model, according to the three perspectives. The methodology also includes a set of access policies for the actors in order to enable controlled access to data and services. The methodology is tested on a real case study for the production of valves in deep and ultra-deep water applications. Experimental validation in the real case study demonstrates the benefits of providing a methodological support for the design of multi-perspective data-oriented services in Cyber Physical Production Networks, both in terms of usability of the data navigation through the services and in terms of service performances in presence of Big Data. © 2022, The Author(s).},

This article proposes a novel revenue-sharing coordination contract that benefits from text mining and the best–worst method to address this problem. We aim to determine a fair share of profit or loss of a movie for each of its actors based on their performance and efficiency on the success or failure of the project. One of the Iranian latest movies is considered as a case study, and its lead actor’s wage is determined under this contract. The sentiment analysis technique investigated the viewers’ opinions about the movie and the actor’s performance. Since the reviewers mainly are the people who have no expertise in cinematography, they cannot discern the influence of other participants on the actor’s performance. So the proposed method used experts’ opinions through the fuzzy DEMATEL method to consider the overlapping effect besides enhancing the validity of the reviewers’ opinions. The results of this paper assert that the actor’s performance will improve under the proposed method and therefore the movie will be more successful and profitable. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a fundamental role in the global economy. However, SMEs usually have different characteristics from larger enterprises, e.g., essential resource restrictions, lower performance, and higher environmental impacts. This requires them to search for strategies to be more competitive and sustainable. A possible solution relies on introducing Lean-Green practices. Previous research indicated that digitalization could be an enabler of Lean. Lean can also help to achieve increased environmental performance using the Lean-Green approach. In this study, this important yet under-studied area is investigated as we consider digitalization as an enabler for implementing lean in SMEs, with a focus on Lean-Green practices. A systematic literature review is executed, following a new framework based on topic modelling for extracting the papers. The topic modelling is executed through latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) which is a machine learning technique. In methodological means, this paper represents an example of the frontier of digitalization for research activities. Regarding the investigated focus, the main findings revealed that digitalization is an enabler to Lean and to Lean-Green. As digitalization supports information sharing, it consequently fosters performance measurement systems, improvements, and value chain integration. © 2022 by the authors.},

To alleviate the computational complexity of the proposed model, it is decomposed into smaller scenario cluster submodels associated with a number of subtrees that share a certain number of predecessor nodes in the original scenario tree. The submodels are coordinated into an implementable solution via a Lagrangian-progressive hedging-based method that employs a viable Benders decomposition based algorithm for solving each scenario cluster submodel. Based on a realistic scale case, computational results indicate the superiority of the proposed flexible dynamic RSC design model compared to the existing models.

Design/methodology/approach: To address this mechanism, this study employs bibliometric analysis and text mining to reconfigure a hierarchical supply chain model under pandemic conditions and associates it with social media to conduct an intuitive visual analysis. Findings: The current academic concerns are related to an overconcentration on risk management and a data-driven approach, generating an enormous gap between the concerns of academics and those of the public. The evidence shows that for both countries with outstanding performance and those that need improvement, the efficiency in terms of preventing the spread of the pandemic should be promoted. Originality/value: This study contributes to (1) reconfiguring a hierarchical supply chain model under pandemic uncertainties and (2) bridging theory and practice by offering comparable interrelated attributes to guide post-COVID-19 strategies in the supply chain. The findings are that the supply management approach and big data are attributes that involve the concerns of world public and academics under pandemic uncertainties. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {One of the profound impacts of digitalization on supply chains is manifested through e-commerce. The latter has significantly grown during the last two decades, with further amplifications during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has created operational and policy making challenges for firms when deciding about how best to manage the resulting growth in e-commerce. While the impact of e-commerce on supply chains has been widely recognized in the literature, there was no effort to systematically review the literature, conceptualize some of the challenges and propose future research directions. This paper fills this gap by reviewing 153 publications from 1999 to 2019. We classify the reviewed literature based on which supply chain drivers were investigated, as well as, the employed research methodology. In addition, we conduct network and content analysis to uncover the main research themes and potential research directions namely, developing analytical centred; modelling based ecosystem for environment; leveraging data mining to enhance sustainability; balance between growth and sustainability; consumer demand and uncertainty; coordination in e-commerce logistics; last mile alternatives and cost management of innovative technique implementations. Furthermore, based on our literature review, we propose a conceptual framework where we interlink supply chain stages with a firm's business strategy, digital transformation strategy and performance. © 2022},

	abstract = {Pipe burst events pose threats to the safety and stability of water supply networks. Deep learning models have been studied for burst location analysis in recent years, but the applicability of the methods needs further research to cope with different size and hydraulic status of pipe networks. A novel framework of burst area identification based on an improved DenseNet model is proposed in this paper. First, according to regional characteristics of hydraulic state caused by pipe burst events, pipe network is divided into monitoring areas. Then, a new model by fully linear DenseNet with attention mechanism (FA-DenseNet) is developed for effective feature extraction and burst area identification. Thirdly, Bayesian optimization algorithm is introduced to automatically optimize the hyperparameters of the deep learning model for better accuracy. The proposed framework was tested in a real-life example network with synthetic burst monitoring data, and the accuracy of burst area identification reaches 0.918. The model is also compared with a traditional BP neural network and a DenseNet model without attention mechanism, and the results show that FA-DenseNet is more robust with the respects of different pipe burst conditions, monitoring noise and the number of pressure monitoring points. The proposed framework provides water companies an applicable and effective method of pipe burst identification and inspection. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and innovation has received considerable attention in the last two decades. While several studies have explored the impact of CSR on innovation. While several studies have explored the impact of CSR on innovation, few studies have attempted to use bibliometric methods to analyze and visualize the evolution and trends in the CSR and innovation fields. In this research, 1279 Web of Science (WoS) published papers on CSR and innovation were collected and analyzed using VOSviwer, CiteSpace, and Bibliometrix R-package and the MK trend test. The analysis was conducted in terms of the number of articles published per year, most productive journals, authors, and countries, as well as collaboration between countries and authors, keyword analysis, co-citation clustering analysis, and research frontiers. The results showed that: (a) The MK trend test shows that the amount of CSR and innovation research is increasing. The top three journals in terms of productivity are Sustainability, Journal of Cleaner Production, and Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management. The collaboration between authors forms a loose network and Ahmad, N has the most extensive network of international collaborations. There is close cooperation between countries, with a predominance of Asian, European, and North American collaborations, and the MK trend test shows that each country’s publications on the relationship between corporate social responsibility and innovation in the past 20 years have an obvious upward trend. (b) Through the analysis of keywords, it is necessary to research “corporate social responsibility”, “sustainability”, “innovation”, “financial performance “, and other topics associated with these themes. (c) The intellectual structure of CSR and innovation establishes five core clusters, including social innovation, CSR practice, sustainable global value chain, sustainable business model, and buyer–supplier collaboration. (d) Two forward-looking directions for future CSR and innovation research are proposed, and the limitations of the research are discussed. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The globalization of the integrated circuit (IC) supply chain has moved most of the design, fabrication, and testing process from a single trusted entity to various untrusted third-party entities worldwide. The risk of using untrusted third-Party Intellectual Property (3PIP) is the possibility for adversaries to insert malicious modifications known as Hardware Trojans (HTs). These HTs can compromise the integrity, deteriorate the performance, deny the service, and alter the functionality of the design. While numerous HT detection methods have been proposed in the literature, the crucial task of HT localization is overlooked. Moreover, a few existing HT localization methods have several weaknesses: reliance on a golden reference, inability to generalize for all types of HT, lack of scalability, low localization resolution, and manual feature engineering/property definition. To overcome their shortcomings, we propose a novel, golden reference-free HT localization method at the pre-silicon stage by leveraging graph convolutional network (GCN). In this work, we convert the circuit design into its intrinsic data structure, graph, and extract the node attributes. Afterward, the graph convolution performs automatic feature extraction for nodes to classify the nodes as Trojan or benign. Our approach is automated and does not burden the designer with manual code review. It locates the Trojan signals with 99.6% accuracy, 93.1% $F1$ -score, and a false-positive rate below 0.009%.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

Methods: In this research, eighteen risk factors in the logistics sector have been identified through both literature review and recommendations from a group of academicians and experts in the sector. A survey was conducted to rank these risks. They were further analyzed through a weighted interpretive structural modeling (WISM) approach in order to demonstrate mutual relationships among these risks. Results: Finally, using a WISM approach, an analysis was conducted to identify the driving and dependence power of the risk factors. This study covers a variety of micro-risk factors of logistics service providers and demonstrates the relationships among them and clusters them based on their driving and dependence power. Conclusions: Such a clustering of the risk factors helps us identify those that affect the others and are of paramount importance in risk management and mitigation. © 2022 by the authors.},

For the same relation hierarchical models, clustering the various key enactors of sustainability in processed FSCs, every functional tier was developed. This relational, hierarchical framework was contemplated by implying the Pythagorean fuzzy set. The proposed methodology handled the mutual interrelation between the enactors and the uncertainty associated with human judgments, establishing the sequence of sustainability enactors.

	abstract = {The retail industry is becoming increasingly competitive; as a result, companies are seeking to reduce inefficiencies in their supply chains. One way of increasing the efficiency of operations inside a warehouse is by better allocating products in the available spaces. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic approach to solving the storage location assignment problem (SLAP) considering precedence constraints, in multi-aisle, multi-product picking warehouses. A two-phase heuristic procedure is developed: the products are clustered and assigned to the available spaces. We tested the procedure in the non-perishables warehouse of a real-world Portuguese retail chain, which supplies 191 stores per day. The results show that the new assignment of products allows for an improvement of up to 15% on the distance travelled by the pickers, which implies savings of approximately 477 km per month. This problem is a special case of SLAP since we are dealing with large percentages of non-uniform products. This procedure incorporates four relevant criteria for the allocation decision: the products’ similarity, demand and weight, and the distance travelled by the picker. By using a two-phase heuristic method, this study offers companies and academics an alternative and more effective solution for SLAP than the usual methods based on the creation of density zones. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Using the classical information retrieval techniques, a more than twenty thousand documents are analyzed for the cyber content. In particular, we build the topic models using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The literature corpus is build through a uniform keyword search process made on the scholarly and the non-scholarly platforms filtered through the years 2010-2021. To qualitatively know the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cyber-security, and perform a trend analysis of key themes, we organize the entire corpus into various (combination of) categories based on time period and whether the literature has undergone peer review process. Based on the weighted distribution of keywords in the aggregated corpus, we identify the key themes. While in the pre-COVID-19 period, the topics of cyber-threats to technology, privacy policy, blockchain remain popular, in the post-COVID-19 period, focus has shifted to challenges directly or indirectly brought by the pandemic. In particular, we observe post-COVID-19 cyber-security themes of privacy in healthcare, cyber insurance, cyber risks in supply chain gaining recognition. Few cyber-topics such as of malware, control system security remain important in perpetuity. We believe our work represents the evolving nature of the cyber-security discipline and reaffirms the need to tailor appropriate interventions by noting the key trends. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Traditionally, early warning systems for food safety are based on monitoring targeted food safety hazards. Optimal early warning systems, however, should identify signals that precede the development of a food safety risk. Moreover, such signals could be identified in factors from domains adjacent to the food supply chain, so-called drivers of change and other indicators. In this study, we show for the first time that such drivers and indicators may indeed represent signals that precede the detection of a food safety risk. The dairy supply chain in Europe was used as an application case. Using dynamic unsupervised anomaly detection models, anomalies were detected in indicator data expected by domain experts to impact the development of food safety risks in milk. Additionally, a Bayesian network was used to identify the chemical food safety hazards in milk associated with an anomaly for the Netherlands. The results showed that the frequency of anomalies varied per country and indicator. However, all countries showed in the period investigated (2008–2019), anomalies in the indicators “raw milk price” and “barely milk price” and no anomalies in the indicator” income of dairy farms”. A cross-correlation analysis of the number of Rapid Alert for Food and Feed (RASFF) notifications and anomalies in indicators revealed significant correlations of many indicators but difference between countries was observed. Interesting, for all countries the cross corelation with indicator “milk price” was significant, albeit the lag time varied from 5 months (United Kingdom) to 22 months (Italy). This finding suggests that severe changes in domains adjacent to the food supply chain may trigger the development of food safety problems that become visible many months later. Awareness of such relationships will provide the opportunity for food producers or inspectors to take timely measures to prevent food safety problems. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The impact of COVID-19 on the global outbreak of supply chain is enormous. It is crucial for governments to take policy recommendations to enhance the supply chain resilience to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19. For such a major issue, it is a common occurrence that a large number of decision-makers (DMs) are invited to participate in the decision-making process so as to ensure the comprehensiveness and reliability of decision results. Since the attitudinal characteristics of DMs are important factors affecting decision results, this study focuses on capturing the attitudinal characteristics of DMs in the large-scale group decision making process. The capturing process combines the ordinal k-means clustering algorithm, gained and lost dominance score method and personalized quantifiers. To enable DMs to express their cognitions in depth, we use the probabilistic linguistic term set to express the evaluation information of DMs. A case study on selecting the optimal policy recommendation for improving the integration capability of supply chain is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed process. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is highlighted through sensitive analysis and comparative analysis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

The details of this important step in the global carbon cycle remain poorly resolved, largely due to the methodological challenges of studying a diverse pool of metabolites that are produced and consumed nearly simultaneously. In this perspective, a new compilation of published data builds on previous studies to obtain an updated estimate of the fraction of marine net primary production that passes through the labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. In agreement with previous studies, our data mining and modeling approaches hypothesize that about half of ocean net primary production is processed through the labile DOC pool.

	abstract = {Over the last decade, supply chain finance (SCF) has gained popularity and increasing attention among academicians and stakeholders in the context of financial flows in the supply chain. However, some research gaps still exist that need to be explored to improve the sustainability of supply chains. Specifically, there is a critical research need to look at the conceptual background of SCF and its potential applicability in various phases of supply chains. Therefore, this article aims to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive State-of-the-Art literature review based on 367 papers published from 2006 to 2020. Furthermore, this article is one of the first attempts to present current and past studies in the domain of SCF in a holistic manner. The analysis highlights the most influential authors, keywords, organisations, leading publications and clusters in existing research areas. This article also sets out a proposed research framework based on the triangulation approach perspective, that is, financial perspective, buyer perspective and supply chain-oriented perspective. The most important and unique contribution of the article is the identification of new and emerging research areas where the application of SCF is still in the nascent stage. These findings can guide stakeholders at every stage of the value chain to appropriately use techniques that model policies to better inform investment and operational decisions in line with Sustainable Development Goals. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Design/methodology/approach: This paper has used a mixed-approach of literature review and expert opinion to identify the factors of RSC. For the development of the structural model and clustering of the factors, this paper has used the total interpretive structural modeling approach with Matrice d’Impacts Croises-Multiplication Applique and Classment and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory analysis. Findings: In total, this study has identified 17 factors that enable the 3R capability of the RSC. The result shows that the factors have a close dependence relationship with supply chain (SC) risk management culture as the most influencing factor. Further, this study classifies the factors into enablers and strategies. Research limitations/implications: This research work is the theoretical contribution to the RSC concept and helps the experts to develop and improve the resilient ability in the SC. This research is based entirely on subjective expert feedback; thus, the results are sensitive to the expert’s judgment. Practical implications: This research will help the decision-makers in allocating the resources and policies to develop or improve the SC capabilities. Originality/value: This research work is the first kind of research in the field of the RSC that considers the 3R concept to identify and model the resilient factors of the SC. Along with the theoretical concept, this research provides empirical evidence for the importance ranking of the factors. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In the absence of epidemiological, microbiological or outbreak data, systematic identification of the hazards and food products posing the higher risk to the consumers is challenging. It is usually in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), where the burden of foodborne disease is highest that data tend to be particularly scarce. In this study, we propose qualitative risk-ranking methods for pathogens and food products that can be used in settings where scarcity of data on the frequency/concentration of pathogens in foodstuff is a barrier towards the use of classical risk assessment frameworks. The approach integrates the existing knowledge on foodborne pathogens, manufacturing processes and intrinsic/extrinsic properties of food products with key context-specific information regarding the supply chain(s), characteristics of the Food Business Operators (FBOs) and cultural habits to identify: (i) the pathogens that should be considered as a “High” food safety priority and (ii) the food products posing the higher risk of consumer exposure to microbiological hazards via the oral (ingestion) route. When applied to the dairy sector of Andhra Pradesh (India) as a case study, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, Salmonella spp., S. aureus and L. monocytogenes were identified as a “High” food safety priority across all FBOs. C. sakazakii was identified as a “High” priority for the FBOs producing infant formula/milk powder whilst Shigella spp., and Cryptosporidium spp. a “High” priority when considering the FBOs operating in the unregulated sector. Given the diversity of dairy products considered in the assessment, cluster analysis was used to identify products that shared similar intrinsic/extrinsic features known to drive the microbiological risk. The risk ranking was then done integrating the results of the cluster analysis with context-specific information. Products manufactured/retailed by FBOs in the informal market were considered as posing a “High” risk for the consumers due to a widespread lack of compliance to sanitary regulations. For dairy products produced by FBOs operating in the middle and formal end of the formal-informal spectrum, the risk of consumers exposure to microbiological hazards ranged from “Moderate” to “Extremely low” depending on the FBO and the intrinsic/extrinsic properties of the products. While providing risk estimates of lower precision if compared to data-driven risk assessments, the proposed method maximises the value of the information that can be easily gathered in LMICs and provide informative outputs to support food safety decision-making in contexts where resources to be allocated for prevention of foodborne diseases are limited and the food system is complex. © 2022},

	abstract = {Since the mid-1990s, there has been a growing interest among consumers and producers in downscaling to a local level the length of the agri-food chains as a solution for fairer and more sustainable food production systems. From the point of view of consumption, the attribute “local” is assuming an important role in defining food purchasing preferences, both in terms of expectations of product quality and in terms of its perceived relevance in determining the supply chain sustainability. This research aims to define how individuals’ perception of local production influences the definition of “local” among consumers based on a survey submitted to a sample of 500 consumers in North-Western Italy. The paper provides: (i) a semantic map built on keywords adopted by the respondents to describe local production; (ii) a categorization of food consumers divided in clusters on the basis of their eating styles; and (iii) a characterization of consumers clusters according to the preferences and knowledge expressed towards local production. The results show that consumers’ awareness and attitudes towards the concept of the “local” are influenced by the joint effect of their socio-demographic profile and their food consumption style, with some unexpected evidences that would deserve to be deepen with further research. However, given this uncertainty, three main traits seem to characterize the consumers attitude towards the “local”: a positive relation among the dimensions of environment, local development and product quality and the strength of the link between local production and the reduction of the length of the supply chain. Ultimately, territoriality is perceived as an index of higher product quality (seasonal, therefore fresh and genuine). © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have been conducted to identify the effects of natural crises on supply chain performance. Conventional analysis methods are based on either manual filter methods or data-driven methods. The manual filter methods suffer from validation problems due to sampling limitations, and data-driven methods suffer from the nature of crisis data which are vague and complex. This study aims to present an intelligent analysis model to automatically identify the effects of natural crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chain through metadata generated on social media. This paper presents a thematic analysis framework to extract knowledge under user steering. This framework uses a text-mining approach, including co-occurrence term analysis and knowledge map construction. As a case study to approve our proposed model, we retrieved, cleaned, and analyzed 1024 online textual reports on supply chain crises published during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019–2021. We conducted a thematic analysis of the collected data and achieved a knowledge map on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the supply chain. The resultant knowledge map consists of five main areas (and related sub-areas), including (1) food retail, (2) food services, (3) manufacturing, (4) consumers, and (5) logistics. We checked and validated the analytical results with some field experts. This experiment achieved 53 crisis knowledge propositions classified from 25,272 sentences with 631,799 terms and 31,864 unique terms using just three user-system interaction steps, which shows the model’s high performance. The results lead us to conclude that the proposed model could be used effectively and efficiently as a decision support system, especially for crises in the supply chain analysis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Safety stock (SS) is an appropriate tactic to deal with demand and supply uncertainty with the aim of preventing inventory shortages. In the literature, previous work on SS estimation assumes that the forecast error distributions (FED) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) following the normal distribution. In order to assess violations of this assumption, there are many solution methods in the recent literature that include the following: (1) Consider the FED as other distribution models, such as gamma distribution or log-normal distribution, etc. (2) Use the Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to consider the Heteroskedasticity phenomena, (3) Use the extreme value theory (EVT) to take into consideration the occurrence of extreme demands, etc. However, the performance of these methods is not guaranteed because there is an absence of comparative studies. Indeed, the estimation of SS is based on the approximation of quantiles of the FED. Such quantiles are related to the cycle service levels (CSL) that are important to achieve company goals. Accordingly, the aim of this research is to propose two combined empirical methods to determine the SS in a more robust fashion and compare them with traditional methods under different supply chain parameters. The first combined method, named Filtered Historical Simulation (FHS), consists of combining the GARCH model with the simulation method. The second combination named Conditional Extreme Value Theory (CEVT) is the GARCH model with EVT. To validate these proposed combined methods, the SS is also estimated using traditional methods, such as simple exponential smoothing (SES), simulation, and kernel density estimation (KDE). The methodology is illustrated with both simulation data and real case study data for different lead times. For the FED, two cases are studied: lognormal distribution and gamma distribution. The results show the superiority of the two proposed combination methods with respect to the tick loss function (TLF) for the different CSL targets and for shorter and longer lead times. Results are confirmed using the ANOVA test. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: With the proliferation of e-commerce companies, express delivery companies must increasingly maintain the efficient expansion of their networks in accordance with growing demands and lower margins in a highly uncertain environment. This paper provides a framework for leveraging demand data to determine sustainable network expansion to fulfill the increasing needs of startups in the express delivery industry. Design/methodology/approach: While the literature points out several hub assignment methods, the authors propose an alternative spherical-clustering algorithm for densely urbanized population environments to strengthen the accuracy and robustness of current models. The authors complement this approach with straightforward mathematical optimization and simulation models to generate and test designs that effectively align environmentally sustainable solutions. Findings: To examine the effects of different degrees of demand variability, the authors analyzed this approach's performance by solving a real-world case study from an express delivery company's primary market. The authors structured a four-stage implementation framework to facilitate practitioners applying the proposed model. Originality/value: Previous investigations explored driving distances on a spherical surface for facility location. The work considers densely urbanized population and traffic data to simultaneously capture demand patterns and other road dynamics. The inclusion of different population densities and sustainability data in current models is lacking; this paper bridges this gap by posing a novel framework that increases the accuracy of spherical-clustering methods. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Industry 4.0 encapsulates a new stage of industrial processes and value chains driven by smart connection and automation. Large-scale problems within these industrial settings are a prime example of an environment that can benefit from ML. However, a clear view of how ML currently intersects with industry 4.0 is difficult to grasp without reading an infeasible number of papers. This systematic review strives to provide such a view by gathering a collection of 45,783 relevant papers from Scopus and Web of Science and analysing it with BERTopic. We analyse the key topics to understand what industry applications receive the most attention and which ML methods are used the most. Moreover, we manually reviewed 17 white papers of consulting firms to compare the academic landscape to an industry perspective. We found that security and predictive maintenance were the most common topics, CNNs were the most used ML method and industry companies, at the moment, generally focus more on enabling successful adoption rather than building better ML models. The academic topics are meaningful and relevant but technology focused on making ML adoption easier deserves more attention. © 2022 by the authors.},

In this paper, we apply LDA, a mainstream topic model, to analyze the risk factor section from SEC filings (10-K and 10-Q), and describe risk structure change over the past two years. The results show that Covid-19 has transformed the risk structures U.S. companies face in the short run, exerting excessive stress on international interactions, operations, and supply chains. However, this shock has been waning since the second quarter of 2020.

This research is conducted with the data mining software, NetMiner 4, utilising the three analytical tools of statistical analysis, keyword network analysis, and topic analysis. The research also utilises the qualitative method of in-depth interviews in order to investigate current trends and perspectives on the future of sustainable packaging and to validate the analysis results. The research findings reveal that research in the field of ‘sustainable packaging in supply chain management’ field has been extremely limited, and this study acts to address this research gap. The results confirm that the vast majority of research focus has been in the fields of engineering and science. Research on the topic has gained momentum and has significantly increased since 2013 with research trends becoming increasingly diversified and gradually aligned with the concept of circular economy, while the topic of operational management has been highlighted as an area requiring additional attention. The keyword frequency analysis reveals the following highest occurring keywords in TF: life cycle; environmental impact; consumer; transportation; and production. The highest occurring keywords in TF-IDF: production; transportation; consumer; food; and environmental impact. Topic modelling revealed the following six topics: consumer behaviour; environmental pollution; circular economy; waste management; resource conservation; and operational management. This study contributes to understanding past, present, and future research agendas, and can be utilised as foundation for research development, as it provides insight to current research status and trends provided by the keyword network analysis highlighting research focus and trends in ‘sustainable packaging in supply chain management’. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: Given the need to simultaneously implement lean and agile (LeAgile) paradigms in supply chain, managers do not know which of these paradigms practices should be given priority. Not knowing this, not only will they fail to apply these paradigms properly, but they will also waste significant financial resources. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the practices of LeAgile paradigms and their effects on the supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach: Because the military products play a key role in national security enhancement, this research is done in the military product supply chain. Research methodology is an exploratory, mixed and descriptive one. In terms of its purpose, it is an applied research based on identifying and searching for practices and the use of interpretive equations. First, the authors identify the most important and implementable LeAgile practices in the form of importance feasibility analysis matrices. Then, using fuzzy interpretative structural modeling, a model is presented to show the logical relationships and hierarchy between paradigms, practices and their impact on supply chain performance. The research tool in both main stages of the research was the questionnaire completed by industrial and academic experts. The selection of experts was done purposefully. Findings: The results show that of total 100 practices introduced in the previous research for LeAgile supply chain, 21 practices in the lean and agility of the supply chain of military industries are important and implementable. The final model of this study illustrates the hierarchical relationships between 21 practices and its effect on supply chain performance key measures. This model shows that LeAgile paradigms are intertwined and their simultaneous implementation leads to improved supply chain performance. In this model, supplier-related practices play a driving and fundamental role and become a top priority for implementation. Research limitations/implications: Military products variation in land, air and sea areas and the large number of industries in each sectors, forced us to select the only land area. Although the results of this research can be used in the air and sea areas, one cannot say that Implementation of this study by its presented model will fully lead to the military industries supply chain (SC) lean and agility in air and sea sectors. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first research on the SC legality in Iran’s military industry which tries to apply these two paradigms simultaneously in the SC and bridge the gap between theory and practice. Clustering LeAgile practices, based on two measures of importance and feasibility, and defining four strategies for implementing these measures, is a new approach to focus on deploying practices that are currently more feasible. Identifying a significant number of SC LeAgile practices (100 practices) and demonstrating the interactions between important and feasible practices in the military products SC are another innovation in this research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing attention around industrial opportunities in African countries, the region is still struggling to enter the global competition. To seize opportunities and limit persisting risks, investors need to evaluate the most suitable country to locate or re-locate the supply chain relying on companies and sector requirements and considering all the variables. Researchers and practitioners have widely investigated methods and tools to support the decision-making process for location selection, primarily through the multi-criteria decision-making models. However, the criteria and approach required in developing countries are entirely different from developed ones primarily due to the variability and complexity of the context. As a matter of fact, there is no proof of integration of gap assessment elements and risk evaluation within the aim of multi-criteria decision-making models in emerging markets. This paper proposes a full-blown method that supports business leaders in the optimal foreign locations, integrating multi-criteria decision-making models (Analytic Hierarchy Process and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and cluster analysis (K-Means) with gap assessment evaluations. The proposed approach differs from the classical one in considering the distance between the selected options and target values, providing essential information to provide a risk assessment and positively affect the investment performance. The approach has been tested on African countries, considering a group of decision-makers from a Textile & Clothing Italian company. The results highlight that Mauritius is the most suitable location for the company, matching the current situation in the country. Moreover, the gap assessment phase provides crucial information about the main discrepancy in Mauritius, highlighting that there are still significant gaps in the “Environmental and territory conditions”, “Local infrastructure,” and “Technology and logistic supplier”. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Since its identification in 2019, Covid-19 has spread to become a global pandemic. Until now, vaccination in its different forms proves to be the most effective measure to control the outbreak and lower the burden of the disease on healthcare systems. This arena has become a prime target to criminal networks that spread counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines across the supply chain mainly for profit. Counterfeit vaccines provide false sense of security to individuals, heightens the risk of exposure and outbreak of the virus, and increase the risk of harm linked to Covid-19 infection. Moreover, the increase in counterfeit vaccines feeds hesitancy towards vaccination and erodes the trust in mass immunisation pro-grammes. It is therefore of paramount importance to work on rapid and reliable methods for vaccine authentication. Subsequently this work utilised a portable and non-destructive near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic method for authentication of Covid-19 vaccines. A total of 405 Covid-19 vaccines samples, alongside their main constituents, were measured as received through glass vials. Spectral quality and bands were inspected by considering the raw spectra of the vaccines. Authentication was explored by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to the multiplicative scatter correction-first derivative spectra. The results showed that NIR spectra of the vaccine featured mainly bands corresponding to the mRNA active ingredient. Fewer bands corresponded to the excipients and protein spectra. The vaccines NIR spectra were strongly absorbing with maximum absorbances up to 2.7 absorbance units and that differentiated them from samples containing normal saline only (constituent reported for counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines). Clustering based on PCA offered optimal authentication of Covid-19 vaccines when applied over the range of 9000–4000 cm-1These findings shed light on the potential of using NIR for analysing Covid-19 vaccines and presents a rapid and effective initial technique for Covid-19 vaccine authentication. © 2022 Assi et al.

	abstract = {With the expansion of the semiconductor supply chain, the use of recycled field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has become a serious concern. Several methods for detecting recycled FPGAs by analyzing the ring oscillator (RO) frequencies have been proposed; however, most assume the known fresh FPGAs (KFFs) as the training data in machine-learning-based classification. In this study, we propose a novel recycled FPGA detection method based on an unsupervised anomaly detection scheme when there are few or no KFFs available. As the RO frequencies in the neighboring logic blocks on an FPGA are similar because of systematic process variation, our method compares the RO frequencies and does not require KFFs. The proposed method efficiently identifies recycled FPGAs through outlier detection using direct density ratio estimation. Experiments using Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs demonstrate that the proposed method successfully distinguishes recycled FPGAs from 35 fresh FPGAs. In contrast, a conventional recycled FPGA detection method results in certain misclassification. © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Amaranth (Amaranthus sp.) is a promising indigenous leafy vegetable plant capable of contributing to food security in sub-Saharan Africa, thanks to its adaptability to diverse soils and its drought tolerance. Its edible parts such as leaves are characterized by high nutrient content. Food losses along the supply chain due to spoilage, however, especially of fresh produce is a challenge facing most of the sub-Saharan African countries in tackling food insecurity in the region. This calls for innovative yet inexpensive solutions such as natural fermentation to preserve the quality and safety of the commodity. To demonstrate the feasibility of natural fermentation in the preservation of vegetable amaranth, leaves were submerged (1:0.5 w/v) in distilled water with 3% sucrose and 3% NaCl dissolved. Control batches were prepared using only distilled water (1:0.5 w/v) with amaranth leaves. Samplings of both treated leaves and controls occurred at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h to measure the pH and determine microbial population changes using culture and molecular-based techniques. Furthermore, the effects of treatment on nutritional content were assayed at the end of the process to determine the levels of B-group vitamins, β-carotene, lutein, and anti-nutrient phytic acid from unfermented fresh air-dried and 3% sucrose and 3% NaCl treated amaranth leaves. Finally, a visive and olfactive analysis was carried out to evaluate the acceptability of the final product. The significant drop of pH and the correct growth of Lactobacillaceae occurred only in treated batches, although Lactococcus was found in both treated and control samples. Furthermore, mean counts observed on selective media for controls and molecular high-throughput sequencing (HTS) analyses confirmed that in control samples, the undesired bacteria represented more than 60% of the microbial population. In treated amaranth leaves the amount of thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, β-carotene and lutein content were higher compared to the fresh unfermented air-dried leaves, and phytic acid content diminished after 7-days treatment. These findings suggest that treatment of amaranth leaves using 3% sucrose and 3% NaCl does not only preserve the commodity by arresting the growth of undesired microorganisms involved in spoilage and fosters the lactic acid bacteria but also improves the nutritional content of the fermented end product that has been warmly welcomed by panelists. © 2021},

	abstract = {Nowadays, sustainability is one of the critical factors for the success of supply chains in organizations and firms that strive to maintain a competitive edge in the market. In wood industry, due to the need for integrating several business units such as forest entrepreneurs, carriers, pulp and paper mills and sawmills, such industries encounter various difficulties in maintaining effective supply chain collaborations. Literature on wood furniture industry seems to be lagging in terms of research on sustainable supply chain operations. To fill this gap, this study aims at identifying the critical factors that stand as a barrier between manufacturing and environmental sustainability in wood furniture industries. To achieve this aim, an integrated framework based on the triplet of Hierarchical Clustering, Analytical Hierarchy Process and Best-Worst Method has been proposed and implemented in a leading furniture manufacturer in UAE. The results show that waste management is the primary concern when an organization wants to pursue manufacturing environmental sustainability. Resources come in the second place where non-renewable resources should be substituted by renewable ones. The results were supported by a sensitivity analysis which confirms that higher attention should be directed to recycling of wood waste. Findings of this study provide recommendations to managers and decision makers on how to improve the manufacturing environmental sustainability in wood furniture industries to achieve the Triple Base Line (TBL) concept of sustainability and integrate sustainably in industry 4.0 context. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {How to locate the reasonable targets for carbon emission reduction in the complex global supply chain remains a big challenge for policy makers. This paper proposed a novel framework for finding more accurate carbon emission reduction targets, combining multi-regional input-output analysis, complex network approach and an improved susceptible–infective model called the influence spreading model. The results showed that the global embodied carbon emission flow network had the characteristic of being significantly scale-free, and there were a few important industrial sectors in the network with different capabilities, including strength-out, closeness-out, betweenness and clustering coefficient. The simulation results of the influence spreading process showed that the effective infection thresholds were relatively low, which were between 0 and 0.005 due to the significant scale-free characteristic of the global embodied carbon emission flow network. With the change of the infection thresholds, the proportion of the infected sectors significantly decreased from about 0.95 to 0.10 on average, and spread time also decreased from about three rounds to about eight rounds. In the aspects of the spreading scope and spreading speed, the industrial sectors with high closeness-out and betweenness had better performance than the ones with high strength-out. This indicated that the spreading capabilities of industrial sectors which exported significant carbon emissions, such as petroleum, chemicals and non-metallic mineral products in China, were commonly weaker than industrial sectors which occupied the most important positions in the entire supply chain, such as transport equipment in Germany. Hence, the industrial sectors with high global spreading capability and media capability were important for global carbon emission reduction. Such information suggested that the policies for carbon emission reduction should be made based on a global perspective of the supply chain system. This work proved that the policies for carbon emission reduction should be based on a global perspective of supply chain system. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth in the supply chain of electronic devices has led companies to purchase Intellectual Property or Integrated Circuits from unreliable sources. This dispersion in the design to fabrication stages of IP/IC has led to new attacks called hardware Trojans. Hardware Trojans can bargain information, reduce performance, or cause failure. Various methods have been introduced to detect or prevent hardware Trojans. Machine learning methods are one of these. Selecting the type and number of input variables in the learning algorithm has an important role in the performance of the learning model. Some previous hardware Trojan detection studies have used structural gate-level features to create data sets for machine learning models. In this paper, a method based on directed graphs for extracting features is proposed. The proposed method use Graph Centrality Algorithm and structural gate-level features. To examine the importance and the impact of the extracted features with the proposed method, three types of data sets are created as input to the learning model made with XGBoost. The trained learning models based on these three data sets show that extracting graph-based features has improved the F1-score by 10% and the ROC by 22%. The combination of these features with the structural gate-level features improved the F1-score by 17.5% and the ROC by 38.5%. © 2022 Materials and Energy Research Center. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {China has posed great importance on green development, a model for economic transformation that enhances public welfare while sustaining environment and resources. Meanwhile, China has the largest number of industrial parks which is crucial for both the global supply chain and national economy. Diversified green development demonstration programs have been promoted with a top-down paradigm facilitated by the central government due to the parks’ important roles in industrial development and pollution control. There is a growing knowledge body about the green development of the parks, and Chinese cases accounted for the largest share of peer-reviewed publications. This article provides a review of academic papers and grey documents on the topic since 2000 by descriptive and bibliometric analysis. We extract five major research focuses by keyword clustering of 129 peer-reviewed articles, namely, the planning of eco-industrial parks, the improvement of environmental management, the evolution of industrial symbiosis and supply chain networks, the optimization of infrastructure, and the assessment of economic-environmental performance. Then, diversified practices of green development in Chinese industrial parks are further enriched by supplementing grey literature and practice. Based on the literature and ongoing practice, we explain the green development model for Chinese IPs and conclude inadequate dissemination of concept and knowledge, heterogeneity of interest, untargeted assessment and guidance, and backward management system are the five major challenges in the field. The review can inspire the scientific community, policymakers, and practitioners in China and other developing countries to further promote green development by targeting industrial parks. © 2022 The Authors},

Real-time PCR amplification detected higher copy numbers for coliform bacteria—Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Shigella spp. in the marketed fish—compared to fresh and frozen samples. The 16S rRNA data revealed higher alpha diversity measurements in the skin of fish from different retail markets of Dhaka city. Beta ordination revealed distinct clustering of bacterial OTUs for the skin and gut samples from three different groups. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria was most abundant in all groups except the Fusobacteria in the control fish gut. Although Aeromonas was found ubiquitous in all types of samples, diverse bacterial genera were identified in the marketed fish samples. Nonetheless, low species richness was observed for the frozen fish. Most of the differentially abundant bacteria in the skin samples of marketed fish are opportunistic human pathogens enriched at different stages of postharvest handling and processing. Therefore, considering the microbial contamination in the aquatic environment in Bangladesh, post-harvest handling should be performed with proper methods and care to minimize bacterial transmission into fish. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Real-time temperature monitoring is necessary in cold pharmaceutical supply chains (SCs), where exposures to extreme temperatures can lead to product quality deterioration. Temperature alarms (TAs) triggered by the current rule-based systems still require lengthy examinations before a suitable corrective measure (CM) can be chosen. However, provision of additional information relevant to TAs can expedite the examination process. In the related areas of recommender systems and false alarm/anomaly detection, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm has proven to be successful because of its interpretability and ease of use. However, in the context of TA processing, it may suffer from some inherent limitations (i.e., varying neighborhood radius, unreliable classifications in sparse and noisy regions, and blindness to natural class boundaries). To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid k-NN (Hk-NN) algorithm based on the principles of local similarity and neighborhood homogeneity. It incorporates a two-step voting procedure with an entropy-optimized k-NN radius, decision trees with k-constrained leaves, and nearest neighbor predictions. We investigate 16,525 comments by alarm personnel for TAs in a pharmaceutical SC and encode them in terms of deviation causes and CMs (target features). We use SC data on cargo location, SC phase, sensor role, and temperature characteristics as predictor features for TA similarity estimation. In eight experimental setups, Hk-NN consistently outperforms k-NN with an optimized k in terms of accuracy, balanced accuracy, macro-average precision, recall, and specificity. At the same time, Hk-NN refrains from predicting observations, for which k-NN's accuracy is close to a random guess. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Food loss management (FLM), which is discussed at length in the literature, lacks a scientific basis on which to determine the current engagement of actors in the food value chain and what is relevant to derive appropriate measures according to the circumstances in the organisations concerned. Therefore, this paper aims to derive patterns by which the engagement of actors can be distinguished and, on this basis, to make recommendations for further action. Methods: Based on an online survey of 40 participants, a clustering analysis was conducted using the unsupervised learning method and hierarchical clustering (R and R Studio). Results: Five clusters representing different profiles were derived, showing how actors in the food value chain have addressed FLM in the past. The derived profiles do not represent stages of development but rather characteristics of organisations that have addressed FLM in a certain way in the past. Conclusions: For the five organisational profiles, recommendations for action were given for further engagement with FLM. As the level of engagement with FLM increases, organisations should tackle increasingly complex measures to reduce food losses. At the same time, a shift in measures from the tactical to the strategic planning level was derived. © 2022 by the author.},

	abstract = {The technological advances in digital space have provided a renewed impetus for business to expand their footprint across digital modes. The growth of the internet and the ease of its access to the masses has encouraged many businesses to go online. Online e-commerce platforms make it easy to search, locate and place orders. Technology-assisted supply chains and fast delivery mechanisms ensure that users don't have to go elsewhere to fulfill their needs. To earn loyalty and customer satisfaction, e-commerce platforms have evolved into a sophisticated recommender system. It has evolved from just an informational source to a participative mode where users can share their experiences about their purchases. Customer values other user experiences more than the information provided by the seller. The presence of many conflicting and contradicting reviews can make the task of making rational decisions difficult for many users. Many studies were performed to understand what constitutes a review helpful and came up with different or mixed outcomes. The present study reviews the factors that influence online customer reviews helpful. Meta-analysis was performed to reconcile the mixed findings of different factors of online review helpfulness. The meta-analysis found that with the moderating effect of product type, factors like review length, readability, rating, reputation, and expertise positively correlate with helpfulness. Further, the customer finds moderate reviews more helpful in terms of polarity. Meta-analysis has a mix of findings for the selected data points in the study. The mixed findings include product type (search, experience, or other) and helpfulness measurement criteria. © 2022 Kavita Rawat and Sunita Kumar.

	abstract = {Enterprise credit risk prediction in the supply chain context is an important step for decision making and early credit crisis warnings. Improving the prediction performance of this task is an academic and industrial focus. Feature selection and class imbalance can affect prediction performance: redundant and irrelevant features increase the learning difficulty of the prediction model, cause overfitting and reduce prediction performance, whereas class imbalance, with many fewer minority class instances than majority class instances, may cause model failure. Herein, a sequence backward feature selection algorithm based on ranking information (SBFS-RI) and a novel ensemble feature selection method integrating multiple ranking information (FS-MRI) are proposed. The FS-MRI method can realize the automatic threshold function while considering the model performance and then output the best and a more stable feature subset. In addition, an SVM ensemble model with an artificial imbalance rate (SVME-AIR) is proposed to solve the class imbalance problem and realize the effective combination of under-sampling technology and the AdaBoost ensemble method for the first time. Finally, FS-MRI and SVME-AIR are combined through a two-stage model design. The hybrid model can effectively solve the feature selection and class imbalance problems for enterprise credit risk prediction in the supply chain context. Supply chain data of Chinese listed enterprises shows that the FS-MRI method outperforms nine other feature selection methods and provides more robust and efficient feature subsets. The SVME-AIR model has higher AUC and KS values than other ensemble models and single classifiers. When combined, the two methods achieve the best prediction performance, with maximum AUC and KS values of 0.8772 and 0.6363, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The challenging situations and disruptions that occurred due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic have created a severe need for supply chain resiliency (SCR). There has been a growing interest among researchers to investigate the resiliency in supply chain operations to overcome risks and disruptions and to achieve successful project management. The supply chain of every business requires innovative projects to accomplish competitive advantage in the market. This study was conducted to identify the significance of artificial intelligence (AI) for creating a sustainable and resilient supply chain, and also to provide optimum solutions for supply chain risk mitigation. A systematic literature review has been conducted to examine the potential research contribution or directions in the field of AI and SCR. In total, 162 articles were shortlisted from the SCOPUS database in the chosen field of research. Structural Topic Modeling (STM), a big data-based approach, was employed to generate several thematic topics of AI in SCR based on the shortlisted articles, and all topics were discussed. Furthermore, the bibliometric analysis was conducted using R-package to investigate the research trends in the area of AI in SCR. Based on the conducted review of literature, a research framework was proposed for AI in SCR that will facilitate researchers and practitioners to improve technological development in supply chain firms. The purpose is to combat sudden risks and disruptions so that project management will perform well Post COVID-19. The study will be also helpful for future researchers and practitioners to identify research directions based on existing literature covered in this paper in the field of SCR. Future research directions are proposed for AI-enabled resilient supply chain management. This study will also provide several implications for supply chain managers to achieve the required resilience in their supply chains post COVID-19 by focusing on the elements of the proposed research framework. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In such a scenario, supply chain resilience is the need of the hour to survive in the competitive environment. One of the key aspects of this implementation is the selection of appropriate supplier in the logistic value chain. Suppliers play an important role in growing a business. Organisations need to work hand-in-hand with logistic partner to give best service to their customers and achieve excellence. However, selection of the suitable partner in a value chain is not an easy task. It is associated with lot of uncertainty. For this reason, the aim of the research is to propose a technique based on multi-criteria group decision making integrated with k-means clustering for the selection of the same. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is used to measure the weights of the factors in first phase. The alternatives are processed in second phase by weighted K-means-based cluster centres for the best cluster. Third phase associates the objective factor cost to get the final ranking order.

	abstract = {Industrial upgrading and international collaboration in production have a vital impact on climate change globally. However, few studies have investigated the potential transmission role of industrial upgrading in the effect of participating in global value chains (GVCs) on carbon emissions. This study combines the value-added accounting method under the new trade accounting framework with the multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model to recalculate the real emissions embodied in trade for developing countries and investigate the relationships among GVC participation, industrial upgrading, and embodied emissions in different groups of countries identified using the fuzzy C-means clustering method. The empirical results show that the transforming and upgrading of industrial structure when participating in GVCs is conducive to easing the expansion of pollution emissions in developing countries such as Russia and Brazil, but the adjustment effect is relatively weak. The industrial structures of developing countries such as China and India face the dilemma of “low-end locking” when participating in GVCs, intensifying pressure on reducing carbon emissions domestically. The governments should promote low-carbon structural reform, cultivate endogenous comparative advantages, and promote the transformation from low-end to high-end product processing to break the path dependence on low-end locking in GVCs. This study provides a reference for governments of developing countries to effectively participate in the division and cooperation of production, conduct industrial upgrading, and reduce pollution emissions. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

Our simulations revealed the following thermal properties of the S-protein: 1) It is structurally stable at 3°C, agreeing with observations that the virus stays active for more than two weeks in the cold supply chain; 2) Its structure varies more significantly at temperature values of 60°C–80°C; 3) The sharpest structural variations occur near 60°C, signaling a plausible critical temperature nearby; 4) The maximum deviation of the receptor-binding domain at 37°C, corroborating the anecdotal observations that the virus is most infective at 37°C; 5) The in silico data agree with reported experiments of the SARS-CoV-2 survival times from weeks to seconds by our clustering approach analysis. Our MD simulations at µs scales demonstrated the S-protein’s thermodynamics of the critical states at around 60°C, and the stable and denatured states for temperatures below and above this value, respectively.

	abstract = {Product traceability is one of the major issues in supply chains management (e.g., Food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, etc.). Several studies has shown that traceability allows targeted product recalls representing a health risk (e.g.: counterfeit products), thus enhancing the communication and risks management. It can be defined as the ability to track and trace individual items throughout their whole lifecycle from manufacturing to recycling. This includes real-time data analytics about actual product behavior (ability to track) and product historical data (ability to trace). This paper presents a comparative study between several works on product traceability and proposes a standardized traceability system architecture. In order to implement a counterfeit/nonconforming product detection algorithm, we implement a cosmetic supply chain as a multi-agent system implemented in Anylogic©. Data generated by this simulator are then used in order to identify genuine trajectories across the whole SC. The genuine product trajectories (behavior) are inferred using a frequent pattern mining algorithm (i.e., Apriori). This identified trajectories are used as a reference in order to identify counterfeit products and detect false alarms of product behavior © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In this work, we address a production and inventory routing problem for a liquid oxygen supply chain comprising production facilities, distribution network, and distribution resources. The key decisions of the problem involve production levels of production plants, delivery schedule and routing through heterogeneous vehicles, and inventory strategies for national stock-out prevention. Due to the problem complexity, we propose a two-level hybrid solution approach that solves the problem using both exact and metaheuristic methods. At the upper level, we develop a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that determines production and inventory decisions and customer allocation. In the lower level, the original problem is reduced to several multi-trip heterogeneous vehicle routing problems by fixing the optimal production, inventory, and allocation decisions and clustering customers. A well-recognised metaheuristic, guided local search method, is adapted to solve the low-level routing problems. A real-world case study in the UK illustrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed optimisation framework. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Consumer demand for organic products, rapidly growing urbanizations levels requires the food supply chain to reduce lead-time and maintain higher product quality. For the food supply chain to cope with the raising issues an e-commerce type of supply chain must be implemented. This approach creates challenges for supply chain, because the food industry must shift towards high variety and low quantity freight forwarding with multiple delivery points. The methodology of the paper consists of scientific literature analysis and macro indicator clustering. The author of the paper proposes a supply chain management framework, which is grounded through complexity theory. The framework mainly consists of 3 characteristics, which organizations should operationalize to maintain system resilience and which in the long-run would evolve to sustainable development–capabilities, collaboration, complexity management. The proposed framework defines how operational and tactical levels should be automated through cyber-physical systems, while the automation should be controlled through strategic level variables. The macro level analysis of existing EU markets of the food industry has been conducted to identify the food industry’s contingencies, in which an agent-based model will be used to validate the proposed framework. Main 3 clusters were identified, which number was chosen based on the elbow method and validated with the silhouette score of 0.749. The food industry can be categorized in to developing, underdeveloped, and developed food industries. Moreover, singularities of different contingencies have been identified which considers population size, population density, market size of the food industry and disruption intensity. The application of the framework depends on the identified contingencies. From strategic level the SCMF is similar in all contingencies, however, depending on the type of market, more emphasize on vehicle routing or demand forecasting should be made. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is a positive single-strand RNA-based macromolecule that has caused the death of more than 6.3 million people since June 2022. Moreover, by disturbing global supply chains through lockdowns, the virus has indirectly caused devastating damage to the global economy. It is vital to design and develop drugs for this virus and its various variants. In this paper, we developed an in silico study-based hybrid framework to repurpose existing therapeutic agents in finding drug-like bioactive molecules that would cure COVID-19. In the first step, a total of 133 drug-likeness bioactive molecules are retrieved from the ChEMBL database against SARS coronavirus 3CL Protease. Based on the standard IC50, the dataset is divided into three classes: active, inactive, and intermediate. Our comparative analysis demonstrated that the proposed Extra Tree Regressor (ETR)-based QSAR model has improved prediction results related to the bioactivity of chemical compounds as compared to Gradient Boosting-, XGBoost-, Support Vector-, Decision Tree-, and Random Forest-based regressor models. ADMET analysis is carried out to identify thirteen bioactive molecules with the ChEMBL IDs 187460, 190743, 222234, 222628, 222735, 222769, 222840, 222893, 225515, 358279, 363535, 365134, and 426898. These molecules are highly suitable drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 3CL Protease. In the next step, the efficacy of the bioactive molecules is computed in terms of binding affinity using molecular docking, and then six bioactive molecules are shortlisted, with the ChEMBL IDs 187460, 222769, 225515, 358279, 363535, and 365134. These molecules can be suitable drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2. It is anticipated that the pharmacologist and/or drug manufacturer would further investigate these six molecules to find suitable drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2. They can adopt these promising compounds for their downstream drug development stages. © 2022 by the authors.},

The digital transformation of the supply chains provides enormous benefits to organizations by empowering collaboration among multiple internal and external organizations and systems. This study presents a narrative review explaining the existing knowledge on digital transformation in supply chain process management using text mining. It summarizes the existing literature to explain the current state of the art in supply chain digitalization. This comprehensive review identifies the most important topics and technologies and determines the future trends in this emerging field. We investigate the articles published in Web of Science and Scopus databases and use text mining techniques (clustering and topic modeling) on the article contents. Using VOS viewer, a bibliometric analysis of 395 articles with 12,700 references is analyzed. The contents of the articles are explored using text mining approaches. The synthesized results reveal that the most important topics in digital transformation are “sustainable supply chain management” and “circular economy and industry 4.0 technologies”. The study further discovers big data, data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things as the most critical technologies for facilitating supply chain digital transformation. Finally, an overlay heatmap analysis of the research articles found that digital transformation, supply chain management, industry 4.0, decision-making, and sustainability are emerging trends in supply chain digitalization. © 2022 by the authors.

During the last years, CO2 allowance prices have undergone unexpected changes, having strong impact on the design and management of optimal SC. The consideration of uncertainty in the allowance prices has therefore become more important. We use an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict future allowance prices. A full discretization of the underlying probability space leads to a number of scenarios far too large to be handled, so we compare two approaches to reduce the number of scenarios to a feasible maximum, the ScenRed algorithm and K-means clustering. The obtained results are compared with a deterministic approach that is widely studied in the literature, showing an increase in the benefits and a reduction of emissions. © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The findings of this paper throw light on the focal research areas within RFID in the supply chain, which serves as an effective guideline for future research in this area. This research, therefore, contributes to filling the gap by carrying out an SLR of contemporary research studies in the area of RFID applications in supply chains. To date, SLR augmented with BA has not been used to study the developments in RFID applications in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: We analyze 556 articles from years 2001 to date using Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Contemporary bibliometric analysis (BA) tools are utilized. First, an exploratory analysis is carried, out revealing influential authors, sources, regions, among other key aspects. Second, a co-citation work analysis is utilized to understand the conceptual structure of the literature, followed by a dynamic co-citation network to reveal the evolution of the field. This is followed by a multivariate analysis is performed on top-100 cited papers, and k-means clustering is carried out to find optimal groups and identify research themes. The influential themes are then pointed out using factor analysis. Findings: An exploratory analysis is carried out using BA tools to provide insights into factors such as influential authors, production countries, top-cited papers and frequent keywords. Visualization of bibliographical data using co-citation network analysis and keyword co-occurrence analysis assisted in understanding the groups (communities) of research themes. We employed k-means clustering and factor analysis methods to further develop these insights. A historiographical direct citation analysis also unveils potential research directions. We observe that RFID applications in the supply chain are likely to benefit from the Internet of Things and blockchain Technology along with the other machine learning and visualization approaches. Originality/value: Although several researchers have researched RFID literature in relation to supply chains, these reviews are often conducted in the traditional manner where the author(s) select paper based on their area of expertise, interest and experience. Limitation of such reviews includes authors’ selection bias of studies to be included and limited or no use of advanced BA tools for analysis. This study fills this research gap by conducting an SLR of RFID in supply chains to identify important research trends in this field through the use of advanced BA tools. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 that broke out at the end of 2019 continues to spread globally, with frequent occurrence of variant disease strains, thus epidemic prevention and control become a kind of routine job. At present, due to the prevention and control measures such as maintaining social distance and community blockades, there is a boom in material purchases in many places, which not only seriously endangers social order and public environmental safety, but also easily leads to the interruption of the supply chain and the shortage of social materials. This article aims to study the intervention methods to curb the spread and spread of panic buying behavior. Firstly, through crawler technology and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model, this article analyzes the intervention measures taken by various social forces in China to curb the spread of panic buying, and summarizes the multi-channel intervention measures including online and offline forms. Secondly, through the multi-Agent Monte Carlo method, the targeted intervention mechanism is supplemented in each propagation link of the panic buying propagation model, and a new social intervention model of panic buying under sudden epidemic is constructed. Then, through MATLAB modeling and simulation, the main factors affecting panic buying intervention are discussed. The simulation results show that: (1) The single plan with the best intervention effect is the supply monitoring. While the official response can play an immediate inhibitory effect, but it is affected by credibility and timeliness. The intervention effect of psychological counseling is limited, and it generally needs to be used in combination with other measures. (2) The combination strategy with the best intervention effect is “supply monitoring + official response + psychological counseling,” and the worst is “information review and guidance + psychological counseling.” Supply monitoring is a key measure to curb panic buying. At the same time, “information review and guidance” will have a certain counter-effect in the combined strategy. Finally, the effectiveness and universality of the proposed model are verified by examples of China and Britain. Copyright © 2022 Fu, Jing, Chen, Yang and Cong.},

	abstract = {Economies are transitioning from a linear to a circular model to address global issues such as resource extraction, environmental degradation and waste generation. Cross-Sector Collaboration (C-SC) is an effective means to use resources in a way that is mutually beneficial and integrates sustainable practices into the value chain. The zero-waste aspiration of companies can be achieved through Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM). Existing literature supports research initiatives in CSCM, but how C-SC influences CSCM is still unexplored. Moreover, the barriers to C-SC for CSCM are untouched and the strategies to overcome these barriers are unmapped. This study fills this gap, assesses the barriers to C-SC for CSCM and suggests a strategic roadmap to overcome these barriers. The study was conducted in three different phases employing a multi-method approach of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC), Fuzzy Delphi and Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL). The results reveal that governance barriers and contextual barriers are causal and influence the other barriers. There is a need to enhance the capacity and optimum resource utilisation for developing circular supply chains; it is possible to facilitate CSCM practices only through collaborative efforts across sectors. The study also highlights that government policymaking and regulation, collaborative value capture model and Industry 4.0 technologies are the most effective strategies for managing C-SC for CSCM. This study contributes to stakeholder theory and resource-based view theory by explicating collaboration among cross-sector stakeholders and highlighting the significance of resource optimisation through waste management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The problem aims to minimize operating costs: opening facilities and the flow of products from factories to customers, passing through warehouses, meeting the capacity constraints of factories and warehouses and customers’ demand. To solve this problem, a hybridization of Clustering Search (CS), Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) and Local Branching (LB) is proposed. This hybridization is a new and interesting approach which has found high quality solutions in low computational time. To show that, computational experiments were performed using benchmark instances.

The “Steel City” of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania exemplifies both deindustrial transition to “eds and meds” and vibrant small-scale production. Cultural geographers interpret place-based craft production as neolocalism, while economic geographers emphasize ways craft can be embedded in evolving economic regions. To understand how local craft production is situated within economic and urban change, this project asks: How do craft producers work–individually and collaboratively–to produce neolocal economies in formerly industrial Pittsburgh? Semi-structured interviews, workshop tours, and a mapping exercise with twenty craft producers and suppliers explored the nature of small-scale production, its embeddedness in place, and professional and supplier networking. The research reveals ways craft workers, suppliers, and organizations in Pittsburgh self-consciously adapt social and material legacies of manufacturing, cluster in particular neighborhoods, and network to build local supply chains and communities. While producers are unevenly engaged in industrial legacies and economies and bound up in wider processes like gentrification, craft labor and collaboration can help maintain traditions of production in places once defined by them. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Data steers the digitalized economy. The transformation of data into valuable information is somewhat comparable with traditional research and development activities and has become one of the most valuable intangibles for many companies. The knowledge discovery method in databases, known as “data mining”, needs to be studied conceptually to demonstrate that the arm’s length principle cannot effectively allocate profits to jurisdictions. Nevertheless, much effort has been put into OECD’s Pillar One, but is it indeed ready to deal with the big data economy? To answer this question, the author briefly introduces the evolution of transfer pricing and presents that the dichotomy between the arm’s length principle comparability completeness and the formulaic apportionment simplicity were merged to create a more robust system to tackle the challenges of the digitalization and lack of physical presence. In a data-driven economy, it is essential to understand the steps involved in the value creation of data. The purpose of the present study is to meticulously delineate the value chain of big data, including collection, processing and analysis and monetization of the data. In conclusion, the author suggests a framework that effectively allocates profits in accordance with the value creation of data. © 2022, International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation (IBFD).

Likewise, object detection in overhead images provides insight for use in many real-world applications yet is still challenging because of substantial image volumes, inconsistent image resolution, small-sized objects, highly complex backgrounds, and nonuniform object classes. Although extensive studies in deep learning-based object detection have achieved remarkable performance and success, they are still ineffective yielding a low detection performance, due to the underlying difficulties in overhead images. Thus, high-performing object detection in overhead images is an active research field to overcome such difficulties. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview and comparative reviews on the most up-to-date deep learning-based object detection in overhead images.

The market of analytic tools offers a huge variety of algorithms and software to exploit big datasets. Implementing their advantages into one approach brings better results and empower possibilities for process analysis. Its application in the manufacturing industry requires a high level of effort and remains to be challenging due to product complexity, human-centric processes, and data quality. In this manuscript, the authors combine process mining and value streams methods for analyzing the data from the information management system, applying the approach to the data delivered by one specific manufacturing system. The manufacturing process to be examined is the process of assembling gas meters in the manufacture. This specific and important part of the whole supply-chain process was taken as suitable for the study due to almost full-automated line with data about each process activity of the value-stream in the information system. The paper applies process mining algorithms in discovering a descriptive process model that plays the main role as a basis for further analysis. At the same time, modern techniques of the bottleneck analysis are described, and two new comprehensible methods of bottlenecks detection (TimeLag and Confidence intervals methods), as well as their advantages, will be discussed. Achieved results can be subsequently used for other sources of big data and industrial-compliant Information Management Systems.  © 2013 IEEE.},

First of all, the basic process of the management service integrator's task allocation to the functional management service provider is given. Based on factors such as business satisfaction and other factors, we construct a management task allocation model based on service income price discounts in the case of fuzzy demand. On this basis, we further dig out the external and internal related factors of supply risk, use enterprise research and data mining methods to verify theoretical hypotheses and identify related factors of supply risk, analyze the impact of the characteristics of cooperation with different types of suppliers in data mining to determine the key factors of supply risk for different types of supply and demand cooperation, and determine the focus of supply risk control for different types of suppliers for data mining. In the process of simulation experiment, the method of maximum satisfaction of fuzzy multiobjective programming is adopted, and the influence of factors such as the preference of decision-makers and price discounts on the result of task allocation is analyzed in combination with specific examples. Finally, on the basis of fully considering the characteristics of management services, we build a comprehensive evaluation index system for management service providers in terms of service capabilities, service quality, informatization capabilities, and cooperation risks and comprehensively consider the uncertain factors in the decision-making process. The experimental results show that the proposed interval data mining solution method based on the degree of possibility can realize the ranking of management service providers by combining the subjective wishes of decision-makers with the objective evaluation of data mining. © 2022 Rui Chang.},

	abstract = {With the expansion of virtual social networks, finding and recommending appropriate and favorite information and items to users is one of the severe issues in their development. To this end, recommender systems predict and recommend interests based on past behavior reviews and user preferences. However, less research has been done on people to people in social networks, and it is still based on exploring communication and friendship circles, which is generally not desirable for specialized users. Social networks include a variety of entities such as individuals, businesses, companies, and technical communications that also contain a variety of information related to the supply chain interaction, such as industries, functions, and communications between them and users. This paper provides a recommendation system framework for recommending people to people in social networks based on supply chain interactions. For this purpose, it has presented five hybrid methods based on artificial neural networks and fuzzy strategies to provide better and more accurate recommendations than basic methods. Eventually, a case study was conducted on the LinkedIn social network to show the improvements in applying this new approach to primary methods. In this regard, seven specific evaluation criteria of recommender systems have been used. © 2022 River Publishers. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Graph signal processing has recently emerged as a field with applications across a broad spectrum of fields including brain connectivity networks, logistics and supply chains, social media, computational aesthetics, and transportation networks. In this paradigm, signal processing methodologies are applied to the adjacency matrix, seen as a two-dimensional signal. Fundamental operations of this type include graph sampling, the graph Laplace transform, and graph spectrum estimation. In this context, topology similarity metrics allow meaningful and efficient comparisons between pairs of graphs or along evolving graph sequences. In turn, such metrics can be the algorithmic cornerstone of graph clustering schemes. Major advantages of relying on existing signal processing kernels include parallelism, scalability, and numerical stability. This work presents a scheme for training a tensor stack network to estimate the topological correlation coefficient between two graph adjacency matrices compressed with the two-dimensional discrete cosine transform, augmenting thus the indirect decompression with knowledge stored in the network. The results from three benchmark graph sequences are encouraging in terms of mean square error and complexity especially for graph sequences. An additional key point is the independence of the proposed method from the underlying domain semantics. This is primarily achieved by focusing on higher-order structural graph patterns. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on management ways within a city multi-floor manufacturing cluster (MFMC). The application of MFMC in megapolises is closely related to the problem of urban spatial development and the problem of matching transport and logistics services. The operation of the MFMC depends on the efficiency of production and transport management considering technical, economic, end environmental factors. Therefore, conditions affecting decision-making in the field of production planning by MFMCs and accompanying transports within the agglomeration area with the use of the production-service platform were presented. Assumptions were created for the decision model, allowing for the selection of partners within the MFMC to execute the production order. A simplified decision model using the Hungarian algorithm was proposed, which was verified with the use of test data. The model is universal for material flow analysis and is an assessments basis for smart sustainable supply chain decision-making and planning. Despite the narrowing of the scope of the analysis and the simplifications applied, the presented model using the Hungarian algorithm demonstrated its potential to solve the problem of partner selection for the execution of the contract by MFMC. © 2022 by the authors.

In this research, a hybrid PCA-K-means is used to transfer a local chocolate manufacturing firm near Kuala Lumpur into a national-wide supply chain. For this purpose, the appropriate locations of the wholesaler’s center points were found according to the geographical and population features of the markets in Malaysia. To this end, four wholesalers on the left island of Malaysia are recognized, which were located in the north area, right area, middle area, and south area. Similarly, two wholesalers were identified on the right island, which were in Sarawak and WP Labuan. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, its outcomes are compared with other unsupervised-learning methods such as the WARD and CLINK methods.

In this paperwe choose a two-stage optimization method to analyze the cigarette distribution route across the Administrative Region in China. First, we use a K-means clustering algorithm to generate an initial center. Then, we optimize the clustering region with the vehicle load and workload as constraints. Finally, we establish the cigarette distribution route optimization model by taking the lowest distribution cost as the objective function. In the model calculation, we not only select the adaptive genetic algorithm as the solution algorithm but also use the scanning algorithm to generate the initial population,design adaptive crossover and mutation probability, and also design inverse operator to correct the error, and we wish to improve the solution performance of the algorithm by this way.In addition, taking the cigarette distribution of Chongqing Tobacco Logistics as an example, this paper analyzes the number of vehicles, average loading rate, and total distribution distance and distribution cost, and finds that the cross-regional joint distribution route is better than independent distribution. And we also find that using clustering analysis and the genetic algorithm could reduce the amount of computation and solve the problem effectively. © 2022 Hong Xiao et al.},

	abstract = {Research interest in COVID-19 in the transportation field has increased sporadically since its outbreak in 2019. This has led to an unprecedented increase in the number of publications in academic journals, rendering it difficult to clearly capture and understand the themes being discussed in the entire literature. This study employs a Structural Topic Model, a robust probabilistic topic model that incorporates document-level metadata to extract hidden topics in unstructured textual big data that focuses on COVID-19 and transportation. To understand the topics identified, the study examined the topical trends over time and compared them to provide insights into authors’ perspectives based on their country’s economic status. In total, abstracts from 421 research articles published in top transportation/transportation science journals were collected and analysed. The results reveal that the major academic concerns in the area of COVID-19 and transportation are related to the changing travel behaviour, airport financial performance, and supply chain optimisation. Overall, research trends seem to be shifting towards shipping emissions, air transport recovery, travel behaviour, and the performance of airports. In addition, authors from both high-income and middle-and low-income countries were found to have different perspectives regarding the topics identified. The findings from this study contribute to understanding topical trends and perspectives in the literature on COVID-19 and transportation and can be used by researchers, policymakers, and fund providers to recognise current research issues to guide future research direction and for making more informed policy decisions. © 2022 The Institute of Urban Sciences.},

	abstract = {Maritime transport plays an important role in global supply chain. To guarantee maritime safety, protect the marine environment, and enhance the living and working conditions of the seafarers, international codes and conventions are developed and implemented. Port state control (PSC) is a critical maritime policy to ensure that ships comply with the related regulations by selecting and inspecting foreign visiting ships visiting a national port. As the major inspection result, ship detention, which is an intervention action taken by the port state, is dependent on both deficiency/deficiencies (i.e., noncompliance) detected and the judgement of the inspector. This study aims to predict ship detention based on the number of deficiencies identified under each deficiency code and explore how each of them influences the detention decision. We innovatively view ship detention as a type of anomaly, which refers to data points that are few and different from the majority, and develop an isolation forest (iForest) model, which is an unsupervised anomaly detection model, for detention prediction. Then, techniques in explainable artificial intelligence are used to present the contribution of each deficiency code on detention.

	abstract = {Purpose: The authors develop a methodology to select appropriate sustainable supply chain indicators (SSCIs) to measure Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the global supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: SSCIs are identified by reviewing the extant literature and topic modeling. Further, they are evaluated based on existing SDGs and ranked using the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Notably, the evaluation of indicators is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process within a fuzzy environment. The methodology has been explained using a case study from the automobile industry. Findings: The case study identifies appropriate SSCIs and differentiates them among peer suppliers for gaining a competitive advantage. The results reveal that top-ranked sustainability indicators include the management of natural resources, energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and social investment. Practical implications: The study outcome will enable suppliers, specialists and decision makers to understand the criteria that improve supply chain sustainability in the automobile industry. The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the competitive package of indicators for gaining strategic advantage. This proactive sustainability indicator selection promotes and enhances sustainability reporting while fulfilling regulatory requirements and increasing collaboration potential with trustworthy downstream partners. This study sets the stage for further research in SSCIs’ competitive strategy in the automobile industry along with its supply chains. Originality/value: This study is unique as it provides a framework for determining relevant SSCIs, which can be distinguished from peer suppliers, while also matching economic, environmental and social metrics to achieve a competitive advantage. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The data of food quality tracing information have a few features, such as wide coverage range, many circulation links, complex data sources, low authenticity, and difficult information sharing. The continuous development of big data technology provides infinite possibilities for the construction of food quality source tracing systems. Currently, there are many studies on the application of food quality source tracing systems; however, most of them are in the field of food quality databases, and few have concerned about its application in the field of big data. Therefore, to fill in this research gap, this paper aimed to study a dynamic source tracing method for food supply chain quality and safety based on big data. At first, this paper summarized the variables of food supply chain quality and safety, constructed a Petri net model and a Bayesian network model for food quality prediction and source tracing, and realized the prediction of food quality features. Then, this paper applied two data analysis and processing methods - the density-based clustering algorithm and the cosine similarity algorithm - to preliminarily process the collected quality tracing information of each link in the food supply chain and analyzed the influencing factors of food quality. Finally, experimental results proved the effectiveness of the constructed model. Relying on the real-timeliness and authenticity of big data, this paper guarantees the credibility of the traceable information in the tracking process and improves the accuracy through real-time stream processing of the updated data, providing unlimited possibilities for the comprehensive tracking of food sources.  © 2022 Jun Song et al.},

	abstract = {With the enormous population growth and the ever-increasing use of various electronic devices in modern life, the proper disposal of the “Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment” (WEEE) has been of paramount importance. The pervasive use of social media by customers has made governments and businesses use these platforms as a rich source of data to extract intelligence on consumer opinions. However, some scholars doubt the sufficiency of social media data concerning the design of a comprehensive list containing all influential factors on consumer behavior toward the proper treatment of WEEE. Thus, a mixed method of quantitative (by analyzing about 2,500,000 tweets from Twitter) and qualitative approaches (i.e. a literature thematic analysis followed by a three-phased Delphi method) has been adopted. Due to consumers’ different behavior based on their local status, the experts have been split into two different panels from developed and developing countries. They have also been provided with the findings from the literature along with the results from Twitter data analysis. The findings have revealed that economic incentives play a pivotal role in both categories. People in developing countries usually have concerns regarding socio-economic and socio-political issues, while in developed nations higher levels of influential factors exist, including proximity, suitability and ease of access, and so forth. The truth is that in order to have a green and pollution-free world, the whole world, whether developed or developing, must take joint steps to create public welfare, peace of mind and world peace. Otherwise, unilateral actions of countries will not have their desired effectiveness. © 2021 Newcastle University.},

Supply chain risk evaluation and prediction is an important problem. With the development of economic globalization, market competition is not the competition between enterprises as in the past, but the competition between supply chains. The model takes many variables such as market environment factors, resource constraints, transportation network factors and management factors as inputs. The data we used is a supply chain data set of an equipment group, which covers many variables such as market environment factors, resource constraints, transportation network factors and management factors. After the supply chain risk evaluation based on K-means clustering, the model is classified by LightGBM to generate the prediction model, and the effectiveness of the model is verified on the real data set. The results of K-Means cluster evaluation show that supply chain risk can be divided into four categories: market environment problems, resource constraints, transportation network problems and management problems, among which market environment problems and resource constraints are the most frequent. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The paper intends to understand the research trends in “Covid-19 and SME” through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and extract themes to explore the most affected areas of SMEs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Subsequently, the study attempts to know the struggles of SME during Covid-19 crisis in a developing country. Furthermore, the study provides a critical dynamic resilience strategy framework to manage the SMEs in the crisis period. The authors extracted data from Scopus and Web of science to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), Extracted data from both databases were merged using R programming get the same tag in R programming. The study adopts a bibliometric analysis to present the research corpus in the domain of “Covid-19 and SMEs”. The cluster method of R programming has been used to usher the significantly affected areas of SMEs. Based on the cluster theme, an open-ended questionnaire was developed and used to interview 23 SMEs in Bangladesh for the case study. NVIVO-13.00 was used to extract the topic from the transcriptions of the interviews. The study reveals that Cash flow shortages and Supply Chain Disruptions are the critical constraints of SMEs. On the contrary, Digital transformation has gained momentum during this crisis. Enterprises that made the best use of digital platforms through technology, digital marketing, and innovations secured the peak of success and profitability. The study also recommends a critical dynamic, resilient strategy model to adopt in the "new normal" for successful navigation of SME business in the future. The study is the first of its kind that integrates SLR and a case study on the hurdles of SME owners during the Covid 19 crisis. Thus, it helps advance the understanding of the subject matter and enables the formulation of resilient strategies by policymakers and SME owners to navigate the business in any potential crisis in the future. The study has significant methodological contribution as it presents how to merge both Scopus and web of science data to conduct bibliometric analysis through R programming. Besides, it also contributes to using R's clustering method to extract themes for “SME and Covid -19” domain. Finally, the study presents an overview of SMEs in crisis such as Covid-19 and a case study of a rising economy and its response measures. The Case study has been designed to concentrate on Bangladesh's SME owners and practical implications potentially limited to Emerging Asian Economies. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) has transformed factories into smart Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs), where man, product, and machine are fully interconnected across the whole supply chain. Although this digitalization brings enormous advantages through customized, transparent, and agile manufacturing, it introduces a significant number of new attack vectors—e.g., through vulnerable Internet-of-Things (IoT) nodes—that can be leveraged by attackers to launch sophisticated Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks threatening the availability of the production line, business services, or even the human lives. In this article, we adopt a Machine Learning (ML) approach for network anomaly detection and construct different data-driven models to detect DDoS attacks on Industry 4.0 CPPSs. Existing techniques use data either artificially synthesized or collected from Information Technology (IT) networks or small-scale lab testbeds. To address this limitation, we use network traffic data captured from a real-world semiconductor production factory. We extract 45 bidirectional network flow features and construct several labeled datasets for training and testing ML models. We investigate 11 different supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised algorithms and assess their performance through extensive simulations. The results show that, in terms of the detection performance, supervised algorithms outperform both unsupervised and semi-supervised ones. In particular, the Decision Tree model attains an Accuracy of 0.999 while confining the False Positive Rate to 0.001. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The main activities in a remanufacturing system includes core acquisitions, remanufacturing operations, and remarketing. Core acquisitions are challenging for remanufacturers because remanufacturing in closed-loop supply chains is characterized by uncertainty in quality, timing and volume. The uncertainty is generally defined as incomplete or incomplete information. Sorting of quality incoming products in the remanufacturing system is a complex problem. On account of all quality conditions can be related either directly or indirectly, making it difficult to define certain conditions individually. Considering that the acquisition process involves many conflicting assessment criteria and subjective-qualitative considerations, an integrated method is needed to prioritize criteria selected. Therefore, this study makes a major contribution to research on multi-criteria sorting problem by developing a new hybrid method. This study focuses on development of a multi-criteria quality sorting model in the remanufacturing system based on a hybrid approach, namely Decision Making Trial Evaluation and Laboratory (DEMATEL) Analytical Network Process (ANP) and Grey Clustering. The DEMATEL approach is proposed to evaluate and to develop the dependency of criteria, and ANP method is utilized for weighting the criteria as well as Grey Clustering is proposed for modelling of uncertainty issues. The model was successful as it was able to identify the most important criteria which proposed. This work has found that maintenance history is the most important attribute in assessing the quality of incoming cores. This finding has important implication for selecting the best maintenance strategy of heavy-duty equipment during the use phase. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {When dealing with Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (ASRS), the allocation of items to the most convenient storage location depends on the vast amount of data produced internally (e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning, Manufacturing Enterprise Systems) and externally (e.g. Supply Chain Management). Moreover, a proper item allocation in the warehouse has a strong influence on the warehouse saturation levels and picking times. In this perspective, the present work proposes the application of data-driven algorithms for managing items in an Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) in order to reduce the picking times and storage space. Specifically, a four-layer framework is adopted for collecting data produced by different information sources and analyzing them through a data-driven approach. The analytics layer is performed by combining the Association Rule Mining (ARM) technique, to investigate the network of influences among data collected, and a simulation approach for assessing the feasibility of the proposed implementation. The Association Rule Mining allows company managers to identify the components that should be located on the same tray in the ASRS, defining the couples of items frequently picked together in order to reduce the total picking time. The proposed approach is applied to the case study of a shoe manufacturing company to explain the research approach and show how the implementation of the data-driven methodology can provide valuable support in defining item allocation and picking rules. The proposed Association Rule Mining method is new in this context and it has shown a positive impact in comparison to traditional solutions of warehouse management, providing a complete overview of the items’ interactions and identifying communities of items that define local and global patterns and locate influential entities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

In LSDVRP, it is difficult to get an exact solution and the computational time complexity grows exponentially. To find near-optimal answers for this problem, a hierarchical approach consisting of three stages: “clustering, route-construction, route-improvement” is proposed. The major contribution of this paper is dealing with LSDVRP to propose the three-stage algorithm with better results.

This paper proposes a research model that is proposed in analyzing the datasets generated from the Downstream Supply Chain Management process, especially the process of selling and shipping E-Commerce goods to end customers. The mechanism used is collaborating process mining and data mining so that the resulting analysis becomes more powerful and better information is obtained compared to only analyzing separately. The results of the analysis in the case study of the E-commerce Costumer to Customer (C2C) marketplace show that process mining related to shipping goods can be explained by adding the results of data mining analysis from the datasets obtained, especially the processes in the Downstream Supply Chain Management Section. © 2022 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

The advanced technologies of machine learning and computer vision have been applied in precision livestock management, including critical disease detection, vaccination, production management, tracking, and health monitoring. This paper offers a systematic literature review (SLR) of vision-based cattle identification. More specifically, this SLR is to identify and analyse the research related to cattle identification using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). This study retrieved 731 studies from four online scholarly databases. Fifty-five articles were subsequently selected and investigated in depth. For the two main applications of cattle detection and cattle identification, all the ML based papers only solve cattle identification problems. However, both detection and identification problems were studied in the DL based papers. Based on our survey report, the most used ML models for cattle identification were support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and artificial neural network (ANN). Convolutional neural network (CNN), residual network (ResNet), Inception, You Only Look Once (YOLO), and Faster R-CNN were popular DL models in the selected papers. Among these papers, the most distinguishing features were the muzzle prints and coat patterns of cattle. Local binary pattern (LBP), speeded up robust features (SURF), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), and Inception or CNN were identified as the most used feature extraction methods. This paper details important factors to consider when choosing a technique or method. We also identified major challenges in cattle identification. There are few publicly available datasets, and the quality of those datasets are affected by the wild environment and movement while collecting data. The processing time is a critical factor for a real-time cattle identification system. Finally, a recommendation is given that more publicly available benchmark datasets will improve research progress in the future. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brings about severe disruptions for human living, economics, and environmental balance. This pandemic has boosted the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and thus, medical wastes. Thus, a research hypothesis is stated whether it would be possible to provide more efficient distribution and inventory planning to optimize the PPE availability in a fuzzy environment. To confirm the hypothesis, in addition to addressing a scientific novelty considering integration of linear programming with fuzzy parameters, named as the Jimenez’s method and clustering heuristic methods, the practicality of these approaches is provided on a real case study and generated instances from Turkey. The computational results reveal that clustering the 32% of the hospitals ensures optimum total cost and solution time while feasibility degree changes between 0, 4, and 1 values of the Jimenez are not more effective on the results. Improved cost results reveal the economic importance of the healthcare supply chain management and optimal PPE distribution and inventory planning can break down the disease propagation and reduce the detrimental impacts on human life. The proposed approach, for the first time, ensures practical and theoretical insights of distribution and storage decisions across disciplines, namely, engineering and health-care organization authorities. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Recognizing and authenticating wheat varieties is critical for quality evaluation in the grain supply chain, particularly for methods for seed inspection. Recognition and verification of grains are carried out manually through direct visual examination. Automatic categorization techniques based on machine learning and computer vision offered fast and high-throughput solutions. Even yet, categorization remains a complicated process at the varietal level. The paper utilized machine learning approaches for classifying wheat seeds. The seed classification is performed based on 7 physical features: Area of wheat, perimeter of wheat, compactness, length of the kernel, width of the kernel, asymmetry coefficient, and kernel groove length. The dataset is collected from the UCI library and has 210 occurrences of wheat kernels. The dataset contains kernels from three wheat varieties Kama, Rosa, and Canadian, with 70 components chosen at random for the experiment. In the first phase, K-nearest neighbor, classification and regression tree, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes algorithms are implemented for classification. The results of these algorithms are compared with the ensemble approach of machine learning. The results reveal that accuracies calculated for KNN, decision, and Naïve Bayes classifiers are 92%, 94%, and 92%, respectively. The highest accuracy of 95% is achieved through the ensemble classifier in which decision is made based on hard voting. Copyright © 2022 Ajay Khatri et al.},

This study aims to evaluate whether the combination of operational and management practices in the fruits and vegetables logistics and commercialization stages are associated with lower levels of wasting in the wholesale sector. Five products from the fruits and vegetables group were analyzed: lettuce, potatoes, oranges, papayas, and tomatoes, sold by wholesalers at a Wholesale Food Market (CEASA). Principal component analysis and association rules were used to recognize the interrelationship of practices that promote the reduction of waste. The self-reported waste of papaya and potato is 5.8%, for lettuce 22.5%, tomato 3.3% and orange 2.2%. There are thirteen practices and behaviors that explain 100% of the variance, which are composed by a technological component and a marketing component. Based on the association rules, the high frequency of eight practices, such as the provision of customer support services and the use of cold chambers, correlate to the reduction of fruits and vegetables waste. © 2022, Sociedade de Olericultura do Brasil.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the design process innovations that enabled the successful delivery of a hybrid, mass-timber high-rise building in Canada, the Brock Commons Tallwood House at the University of British Columbia. It is one of a set of papers examining the project, including companion papers that describe innovations used during the mass timber construction process and the impact of these innovations on construction performance. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-method, longitudinal case study approach was used in this research project to investigate and document the Tallwood House project over a three-year period. Both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis techniques were used. Graduate student researchers were embedded within the project team to observe meetings and decision-making and to conduct periodic interviews. Findings: The research highlights a case of a balanced triple-helix system that provided a context for the successful “clustering” of product and process innovation, which were developed and implemented to flow throughout the project’s lifecycle and across its supply chain to provide benefits at each stage. Four significant process-based innovations were implemented at the design phase of the building project to support radical product innovation: an integrated design process, virtual design and construction, designing for manufacturing and assembling and a rigorous quality control and quality assurance process. The product innovations developed through these process innovations were the structural system and the prefabricated envelope system. The context of innovation was seen to allow this “clustering,” which is believed to be a key condition of success and enabled the efficient and successful delivery of the project. Generally, the approach was successful; however, some factors including the number of stakeholders and good-faith collaboration may limit the replicability of these strategies. Originality/value: This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the instantiation of an innovation system, identified as a balanced triple-helix system, which enabled and facilitated the design and decision-making process for a radical product innovation. Moreover, this paper describes the deployment of a “cluster” of process innovations that flowed throughout the project’s lifecycle and across the project supply chain. This was seen as a key factor in ensuring the successful delivery of the project. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The increase in the frequency and impact of automotive recalls has had broad reaching economic and social consequences. Recent examples of automotive recalls suggest that some are due to deliberate actions of firms to subvert processes designed to ensure quality. Such controls are dependent on partners acting in good faith in the relationship and abiding by relational norms and so do not recognize the risks of firms lying, falsifying data, or intentionally circumventing process-based controls. Data on automotive recalls shows that recalls exhibit a statistically significant oscillatory pattern with an estimated period of around 3.6 years. We argue that the cyclical pattern in automotive recalls is due, in part, to opportunistic behavior within a network, which is likely to spread and be reciprocated. To test whether opportunism can lead to similar network effects, we develop an agent-based simulation to model opportunism within a network of connected firms. The simulation is based on an extension of the prisoner's dilemma where the cooperate/defect decision is based on a dyadic relational model driven by trust, knowledge, and dependence levels within each relationship. The results from the simulation suggest that cyclical patterns, similar to those in automotive recalls, emerge as well as “behavioral clustering” within the network, where connected firms exhibit highly similar behaviors that tend to cycle within small clusters. Therefore, opportunistic behavior in supply networks might be an important, relational determinant of product recalls. Our dynamic modeling approach differs from current perspectives on understanding product recalls, contributing to the current literature. © 2020 Decision Sciences Institute},

In this paper, we present a graph learning approach to define and identify structural similarity between the nodes in a network or the components in a network system. Based on the structural similarity, we investigate component clustering at various significance levels that represent different extents of similarity. We further specify a spectral-graph-wavelet based graph learning method to measure the structural similarity and present its application in easing computation load of evaluating system survival signature and system reliability. The numerical examples and the application show the insights of structural similarity and effectiveness of the graph learning approach.

	abstract = {Recent technological developments indicate possible advancements in supply chain management (SCM). These innovations have attracted a lot of interest from industries including logistics, manufacturing, packaging, and transportation. The conventional systems, however, use centralised servers to control all operations, including the exchange of raw materials, making orders, dealing with buyers and sellers, and updating orders. The network's supply chain may thus be insecure as a result of every activity being routed via centralised servers. The danger is additionally increased by a number of difficulties, including scalability, data integrity, security, and availability. Block chain technology may be used in these circumstances to decentralise transaction processing and eliminate the need for a centralised controller. In this approach, the performance of the resource-constrained supply chain network is improved by the effective use of edge computing and priority data access. The Intelligent K-Means (IKM) clustering algorithm is suggested across the edge nodes in the current research to categorise the priority level of each piece of data. This classifier determines if the edge node has received data that is high priority or low priority. Low priority data is recorded in the log files for future data analysis. Then, to allow safe data flow in the open block chain while excluding outside parties, the High Priority Access based Smart Contract (HPASC) technique is deployed. The whole experiment was conducted in a Python environment, and variables including scalability, reaction time, throughput, and accuracy were studied. Current systems' constrained block sizes and fork creation lengthen the time transactions must wait before being processed. The suggested methodology is quicker and uses less storage space than current block chain systems. The results show that the suggested approach works better than current blockchain technology to raise the standard of supply chain management.  © 2022 Ali Rizwan et al.},

The dataset is unlabeled such that no discrimination is given for any meter whether it records a normal water consumption or not. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that abnormal water consumption (registered by a given water meter) can be identified based on previous records of water consumption measured by the same meter. We tested our hypothesis using well-known anomaly detection methods, namely: Z-score (ZS), local outlier factor (LOF), density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), minimum covariance determinant (MCD), one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), and isolation forest (iForest).

	abstract = {Presently, the development of fresh agricultural products e-commerce is constrained by the cold chain logistics. There are shortcomings such as the incomplete comprehensive supporting system, lacking of logistics technology and low effective infrastructure in cold chain logistics. Scientific and optimal selection of distribution mode is crucial to the operation of fresh e-commerce and urban circulation efficiency. Owing to the problem that urban logistics distribution limits the cold chain logistics of fresh agricultural products, we propose the distribution mode and synergistic mechanism of cold chain logistics of urban fresh agricultural products. By leveraging the theory of logistics and supply chain management, we explore the high logistics cost of fresh e-commerce, inconsistent cold chain logistics standards, and poor consumer viscosity. We introduce the self-established logistics, third-party logistics, self-established logistics, third-party logistics and other three main logistics distribution modes. Due to the impact of cold chain logistics distribution on the existing urban transportation, an integrated mode of self-established logistics/third-party logistics + joint distribution is designed. In order to promote the collaborative development of cold chain logistics distribution and fresh electricity, it is significant to establish three collaborative mechanisms from the perspective of government, enterprises and third-party logistics According to the green logistics, the carbon tax cost and cargo damage cost in the process of cold chain logistics distribution are discovered by a graphical model. The graphical model is constructed under the optimization objective of minimizing each cost. In order to avoid the problem that basic artificial fish swarm algorithm is prone to local optimum, a global artificial fish swarm algorithm is designed and solved. Extensive experimental results have shown the usefulness and effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2021},

However, existing assessment models are not essentially used to explore short-term drastic changes in the environment, such as extreme heat or cold. Therefore, we proposed a climate-food risk assessment system that could detect drastic changes, such as extreme weather events and price fluctuations, in a timely and thorough manner. On the one hand, spikes were detected in the climate system. On the other hand, change points were detected in the food system. Finally, an innovative integrated analysis algorithm is carried out to obtain the ranking of highly impacted foods. Across all food supply chains, we found that sugar, bread and grains, and wine in grapes are most closely related to extreme weather events. This discovery needs to be treated with caution. To initiate a feasible control strategy for climate risk, a concrete policy implication was discussed in detail. If properly organized and supervised, the extreme weather agricultural insurance can become a transformative mechanism toward climate resilience. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This study proposes a location-routing problem to determine an efficient integration of single factory and multi-distribution centers and multi-customers in uncertain demands. This problem can be regarded as an optimization integrating location, distribution decision, and routing management. The objective function is to minimize the total cost and satisfy all the requirements, which is a highly complex NP-hard problem, so a hybrid algorithm of genetic algorithm (GA) and tabu search (TS) algorithm is proposed. A fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is used to produce an initial solution. Fuzzy triangular number and confidence interval transformation are used to deal with fuzzy customer demand. The research findings concludes that (i) determine the numbers of facilities with locations that should be opened and (ii) minimize the total cost in supply chain. The experiments prove that the proposed hybrid algorithm of GA and TS algorithm overcomes the defect of local optimum in the literature viewpoint, and the optimization algorithms can effectively solve the location-routing problem.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Despite the growing amount of published work covering a wide range of I4.0 areas, there has been relatively little research devoted to the organisational side of implementing I4.0. To address this gap, this systematic review paper used quantitative analysis by text-mining 97 articles from 2015 to 2021. The analysis identified eleven research streams, which were grouped into five levels, namely industry and firm, smart factory, data, human resources and supply chain. The research streams were then comprehensively reviewed and presented. For each stream, the paper presents a number of sub-themes and highlights important findings and areas that may require further development. We discuss three important research avenues in the organisational management literature: (1) the impact of the pandemic on the implementation of I4.0, (2) the tension between value creation and value protection during the implementation of 4.0 and (3) the relevance of a contingency approach during the implementation of I4.0. © 2021 The Author(s).

Researchers and industry have constantly improved detection and prevention methodologies against increasingly more evasive malware. Keeping up with the constantly changing adversary tactics for evading defensive efforts and maintaining an efficient malware supply chain is imperative to stay ahead in the competition. In this paper, we present a large-scale and comprehensive analysis of the current state of malware distribution. For the analysis, we accumulated a dataset that contains 99,312 malware binary samples from 38,659 malware distribution sites over 287 days. Using our dataset, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the collected malware binaries and URLs to provide up-to-date statistics and insights into the adversary strategies. We analyze both malware distribution sites and malware binaries collected from them. Regarding binary analysis, we perform a multifaceted analysis on the characteristics on the collected binaries, including malware family label classification and file similarity-based clustering. With distribution site analysis, we analyze the IP addresses, domains, AS registration distribution and URL lexical distribution of malware distribution sites. We further discuss the statistical relationship between malware families and their distribution domains. Most importantly, we discuss the current trends in malware distribution today and reveal adversary strategies through our extensive amount of analysis results. Then, we suggest future directions for fight against malware distribution.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sorghum currently contributes to the species portfolio that is supporting bioenergy production including anaerobic digestion. Although agro-morphological ideotypes maximizing biogas production have been recently proposed, there is a crucial need to refine our understanding of the impacts of the stem composition and structure on this processing trait in order to ensure genetic gains in the mid to long terms. This study aims to assess the potential of Sorghum bicolor ssp bicolor stem genetic diversity to maximize genetic gains for biogas production and define a biogas stem ideotype. In this context, a panel of 57 genotypes, encompassing most of the stem composition variability available in cultivated sorghum, was characterized over five sites. Simultaneous histological and biochemical characterizations were performed. A high broad sense heritability associated with a moderate genetic variability was detected for stem biogas potential ensuring significant genetic gains in the future. In addition, the development of a stem histological phenotyping pipeline made it possible to describe the genetic diversity available for the internode anatomy and the repartition of key cell wall components. Consistently with previous studies, moderate to high heritability was observed for stem biochemical components. Genetic correlation, hierarchical clustering, and multiple stepwise regression analyses identified soluble sugar content as the first main driver of biogas potential genetic variability. Nevertheless, breeding programs should anticipate that biogas yield improvement will also rely on the monitoring of the cell wall components and their distribution in the stem jointly with the soluble sugar content. According to the assets of sorghum in terms of adaptation to environmental stresses and the present results regarding the identification of stem ideotypes suitable for different value chains, this species will surely play a key role to optimize the economic and environmental sustainability of the agrosystems that are currently facing the effects of climate change. © 2021 The Authors.

This study investigates the effect of interpersonal relationship on trust and trustworthiness in four regions in China. Eighty pairs of close friends participated in the experiment: 20 pairs from Beijing, 20 pairs from Guangdong, 20 pairs from Shanghai, and 20 pairs from Chongqing. A cooperation experiment based on a two-tier simulated supply chain was conducted, in which the participant who played as a supplier solicited demand forecast information from the participant who played as a retailer to plan production. Participants were instructed to perform two tasks: one with a “friend” counterpart and one with a “stranger” counterpart. The results demonstrated regional differences in the effects of interpersonal relationship on trust and trustworthiness: the effect of interpersonal relationship was greater in Guangdong than in the other regions. Additionally, a quantified classification of trustworthiness–trust was proposed by clustering analysis. The type of self-protective trustworthiness and altruistic trust occupied an overwhelming majority in each region, followed by the type of altruistic trustworthiness and self-protective trust, the type of altruistic trustworthiness and altruistic trust, and the type of self-protective trustworthiness and self-protective trust. Regional differences in the distribution proportions in the four types were discovered. © 2021 Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.},

Applications of the EAT problem include designing efficient evacuation planning in dynamic scenarios, optimal journey planning in transport networks, and optimal flow management in supply chains. There exist several solutions for the EAT problem in the literature, however, there is limited work on GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) based solutions to leverage the capabilities of the high throughput accelerator for better performance. Further, there is also a need for more efficient methods to process the inherent earliest arrival dependencies in a transport network. In this paper, we propose a suite of five incremental (GPU) algorithms for the one-to-all Earliest Arrival Time problem in public transport networks. The Selective-check-version is the most optimized approach and hence, the key algorithm. It uses an edge coloring based approach to trace the time-respectingness of paths and processing the in-edges in a sorted order based on their arrival times. Its key characteristic is that it is very fast for the best-case networks where all temporal paths are time-respecting. For the Selective-check version, we observed an average speedup of 6.45 against the Serial Connection-scan algorithm and 2.77 w.r.t. the Edge-version algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The importance of business models for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in terms of their competitiveness and sustainability is undoubtedly growing. The global Covid-19 pandemic even strengthens this trend. The degree of digitalization of corporate processes becomes the SME stability and development limitation. The paper submitted presents the results of research focused on the issue of digital transformation of business models on a test sample of 496 SMEs (out of which 214 operate in the manufacturing sector and industry and 218 are included in the services sector) using the method of dimensionality reduction and logit regression. The main output from the solution valid for both tested sectors is considered insufficient setting, management and evaluation of corporate processes. This applies to the main value-creating processes (input and output logistics, production, marketing and sales, service and other ancillary services) and supporting processes (purchase, scientific and technological development, human resources management and company infrastructure). In terms of the achieved degree of process digitization, an imbalance was found between the main value-creating processes and supporting processes. Investment in value-creating and supporting corporate processes are not considered an important factor for any of the sectors due to the high sensitivity of investments to the size and specialization of companies. In contrast, the higher perceived need for value chain digitization in both tested sectors, especially in the case of manufacturing and industry, is considered a very positive output. This proves the need for the digital transformation of companies and its positive impact on their profitability and competitiveness. © 2022, Centre of Sociological Research. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The era of widespread globalization has led to the emergence of hardware-centric security threats throughout the IC supply chain. Prior defenses like logic locking, layout camouflaging, and split manufacturing have been researched extensively to protect against intellectual property (IP) piracy at different stages. In this work, we present dynamic camouflaging as a new technique to thwart IP reverse engineering at all stages in the supply chain, viz., the foundry, the test facility, and the end-user. Toward this end, we exploit the multi-functionality, post-fabrication reconfigurability, and run-time polymorphism of spin-based devices, specifically the magneto-electric spin-orbit (MESO) device. Leveraging these unique properties, dynamic camouflaging is shown to be resilient against state-of-the-art analytical SAT-based attacks and test-data mining attacks. Such dynamic reconfigurability is not afforded in CMOS owing to fundamental differences in operation. For such MESO-based camouflaging, we also anticipate massive savings in power, performance, and area over other spin-based camouflaging schemes, due to the energy-efficient electric-field driven reversal of the MESO device. Based on thorough experimentation, we outline the promises of dynamic camouflaging in securing the supply chain end-to-end along with a case study, demonstrating the efficacy of dynamic camouflaging in securing error-tolerant image processing IP.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The membership degree conversion algorithm is used to mine hidden data knowledge information, and the decentralised filtering is used to hide knowledge information. The mined membership degree value is converted into the target data mining result to realise the supply chain data security mining. The experiment shows that the adjusted random error of this method is less than 0.3, which indicates that the precision of data security mining is high.

Freshness of fish, during that time, gets affected owing to the chemical decomposition of focal tissues like gills, eyes and skin. A novel mathematical model, is being proposed in this article, for the computation of a distinct freshness coefficient, Q-score, obtained by fusing the information from relevant focal tissues like gills, eyes, and skin of the fish. The mathematical model was designed by employing a meta-heuristic approach, where computationally optimized weights have been assigned to the features derived from the focal tissues. These multifocal tissues have been thoroughly investigated and assertive efforts have been made to normalize and integrate the extracted features into a single score. Implementation of the framework, provides an accuracy of 98.07%, indicating the efficacy of the proposed work. The proposed method is automatic and rapid for food quality evaluation. Imaging-based framework for the identification of fish freshness makes the proposed approach non-destructive which upholds its capability to be used in real-time situations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Module production is one of the ways to achieve mass customization, and products are produced by combining modules. In the module production, it becomes much more important for manufacturing companies to reflect customers' preferences for selling products. The manufacturer can increase its total profit by providing customized products that satisfy customers' preferences by increasing customers' satisfaction. In conventional production planning, there are some cases where module production is conducted by the demands from customers' preferences. However, the customer decision-making model has not been employed in the production planning model. In this paper, a production planning model incorporating customers' preferences is developed. The customers' purchasing behavior is generated by using a machine learning model. Customer segmentation is conducted by clustering data that uses the purchase data of multiple customers. The resulting production planning model is a bilevel production planning problem consisting of a single company and multiple customers. Each company can sell products that combine modules that customers require in each segment. We show that the proposed model can obtain higher customers' satisfaction with greater profits than the model that does not employ the customers' purchasing model. © 2022 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

	abstract = {Cistanche deserticola Ma was used as a medicine food homology, which was mainly produced in the Alxa region of northwest China. In recent years, it has been widely used in various food items. The increasing demand for Cistanches Herba has led to problems such as overexploitation and quality deterioration. The quality and safety of herbal medicines are critical and have been shown to be affected by the value chain (VC). Using the VC framework, the study is embedded in a larger study aiming to investigate the effects of different VCs types on the quality and stakeholders of Cistanches Herba. In this study, 90 Cistanches Herba samples were collected during fieldwork. An additional 40 samples were obtained from the herbal markets and medicine purchasing stations. Semi-structured interviews and key informant interviews were performed to collect data on stakeholders in major production areas. These samples were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with the k-means clustering method; a targeted quality assessment strategy based on chemical analysis was adopted to understand the quality of Cistanches Herba. Based on market research, the collected samples were divided into different grades through k-means clustering analysis. Moreover, quality differences of Cistanches Herba in Alxa region were explored through DNA barcoding and chemical analysis. Accordingly, 10 different types of VCs were determined in the production of Cistanches Herba. The results show that there is a close relationship between the quality of Cistanches Herba and stakeholder benefits. Vertical integration at different levels was found for independent farmer-based VCs, horizontal collaboration was found in the cooperative-based VCs. The vertical coordination has led to a more consistent traceability system and strict regulation of supply chains. At the same time, the Cistanches Herba were divided into three grades. Through DNA barcoding and chemical analysis, we found that the quality differences between Cistanches Herba in the Alxa area were not significant. It was found that geographical suitability and vertical integration could impact the quality and sustainable production of Cistanches Herba. At the same time, the well-developed VCs can provide products with reliable quality, and ensure adequate financial revenue for relevant stakeholders. © Copyright © 2021 Jiang, Zhou, Wang, Bi, Guo, Wang, Yao and Li.},

	abstract = {A regional approach to the study of Brazil’s beef industry is increasingly relevant as deforestation takes centre stage in policy debates worldwide. To what extent has beef production expanded toward regions hosting sensitive ecosystems such as the Amazon? Important data limitations remain to answer this question, especially regarding slaughterhouses, fundamental to the beef supply chain. This paper addresses the data gap on slaughterhouse location and history and provides novel regional analysis. We map the beef industry’s evolution into Brazil’s interior over the last six decades and quantify changes in market concentration between 2006 and 2016. To accomplish this, we triangulated across fiscal and animal sanitation data sources to produce the first longitudinal dataset with information on the opening and closing dates, locations, and production volumes of 2602 slaughterhouses. We show the linear movement of slaughterhouses and cattle herds to the Amazon by tracking their geographical centres of gravity. We also show the clustering pattern of slaughterhouses. Until the 1960s, all the geographical clusters were located south of the capital, Brasília. By the early 2000s, clusters north of Brasília were almost as extensive. Finally, we assessed the degree of market power that the largest beef-processing companies possess. The results indicate that market concentration increased in regions of more recent settlement further away from the coast, and that it remained relatively stable in states near the coast (Minas Gerais, São Paulo). The results shed light on the relationship between displacement toward the Amazon and Cerrado regions and economic concentration. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Sensitive association rule hiding is an important issue of data sharing for supply chains, which can ensure mutual benefits and avoid information leakages among different enterprises. An integrated method is proposed by using Apriori and the discrete binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm, aiming to improve the rule hiding efficiency and effectiveness. The Apriori algorithm is used to extract the association rules from sharing data. The selected sensitive association rules can be hidden using BPSO based on constructing discrete binary space and multi-objective fitness functions. The proposed method is verified through a case study. The results show that the proposed method can effectively hide sensitive information and protect enterprises' business benefits. © 2021 The Authors.

This study introduces an analytical approach that can quickly scan financial data of many companies and produce a summary measure for each company. The approach offers organizations a less wearing way to obtain a holistic view of all target companies’ financial performance patterns, which imply the underlying supply chain strategies. The strategy map, a two-dimensional representation of the summary, provides a comprehensible means to apprehend the relative strategic position and measure the similarity between companies. The approach relies on three popular machine learning models, forecasting, clustering, and classification. It takes multi-year, multi-variate financial time series from the three standard financial statements, learns the patterns from the data, and tunes model parameters to configure the final settings for future applications. The input data needed are relatively easy to obtain and the self-learning modules only require modest domain knowledge to apply the approach. Its noise reduction, outlier detection, and feature selection functions ensure a consistent and robust performance. The empirical test using data from all US manufacturers and traders listed on NYSE and NASDAQ demonstrates the efficacy of the approach. © 2022 Institute of Industrial & Systems Engineers.},

	abstract = {Lately, in some regions and seasons in China, urban consumers have paid high in buying fresh agricultural products while farmers get unreasonable income from producing them. To seek the reason for the phenomenon and explore ways to simulate it, this study constructed and implemented a complex network model named the Bi-Level Multi-Local-World (BI-MLW model) with characteristics of an interdependent coupling relationship between its participants. To verify the validity of the model, this study implemented an experimental simulation under Small Decentralized Operation Mode (SDOM) and Large Centralized Operation Mode (LCOM) scenarios using Cucurbita pepo and Cucumber in the Tianjin area of China as sample empirical products. Results indicate that nodes do not increase edges rapidly which reflects that even large firms in agricultural business cannot occupy markets fleetly. Furthermore, under the SDOM scenario the BI-MLW model exposes scale-free features with a small average degree value and low average clustering coefficient, while under the LCOM scenario, the model displays a rising average clustering coefficient and a lowered average path length. Both of which are consistent with the common view in literature and features of reality. Thus, the BI-MLW model specially designed for fresh agricultural products supply chain can improve the descriptive ability than conventional Erdös-Rényi (ER), Barabási-Albert (BA), Bianconi-Barabási (BB) network models. © 2022, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Multi-depot capacitated vehicle routing problem is a derivative of vehicle routing problem and a well-known area that has been studied widely with various applications and constraints. Many studies in it focused on minimizing cost and distance with assumption that all nodes are visited. Ironically, number of unserved customers (nodes) in a single trip was rarely explored and often ignored. Based on this problem, this work aims to minimize the total travel distance and the number of unserved customers in single routing cycle. The solution is developed by combining the stable marriage algorithm and k-means clustering in the clustering process. The nearest neighbour algorithm is used in the routing process. This work proposes two contributions. The first is the usage of the stable marriage and k-means clustering. The second is concerning the predetermined distribution of the vehicles in the solution to reduce the number of unserved customers. In the simulation, this proposed model is compared with the hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA), partition-based algorithm-nearest neighbour algorithm (PBA-NN), genetic algorithm-nearest neighbour algorithm (GA-NN) and simulated annealing algorithm (SA). Based on the simulation result, it is found that the proposed model performs moderately as a trade-off between the SA and PBA-NN. In the number of unserved customers aspect, when the number of customers is low, the proposed model creates 71 percent lower than the PBA-NN model. Meanwhile, when the number of customers is high, the proposed model creates 73 percent lower than the PBA-NN model. In the total travel distance aspect, when the number of customers is low (50 persons), the proposed model creates 63 percent higher than the GA-NN model and 48 percent lower than the SA model. Meanwhile, when the number of customers is high (100 customers), the proposed model creates 52 percent higher than the PBA-NN model and 54 percent lower than the SA model. © 2021, International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.

	abstract = {The worldwide transportation industry relies heavily on shipping containers. Containerization has made it easier to transfer goods all over the world by guaranteeing cargo safety while in transit. To ensure the safety of goods during the transition, shipping containers should be reliable and kept in healthy conditions. Surface defect inspection of shipping containers is of great importance to guarantee the quality of containers. Customs officers must check the surface of shipping containers as they pass through terminal gates during the transition. Human visual observation is the basis for the current inspection method, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and possibly hazardous. The purpose of this research is to present a deep learning-based framework that can be used in conjunction with a computer vision technique to successfully and efficiently inspect corrosion defects on the surface of shipping containers. The proposed framework consists of two main modules, including High-resolution and Temporal Context region-based convolutional neural network (HRTC R-CNN) for corrosion defect detection and corrosion defect characterization (CDC) for corrosion defect inspection. HRTC R-CNN uses a multistream backbone, multidepth, and multiscale super-resolved feature generation to extract semantic information from different defect scales. The shallow network receives high-resolution images to maintain positional information, while the deep network receives low-resolution images to extract semantic information. In order to increase the framework's performance, an attention mechanism and two memory banks are used to leverage context information from unlabeled images. In CDC, an optical flow-based image stitching is proposed to calculate the percentage of corrosion on the surface of the whole container. Experiments on the corrosion defect dataset demonstrate the excellent accuracy and resilience of our approach. This technology will expedite the process of container's defect inspection at terminals, thereby supporting container transport logistics and supply chain processes. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

The main findings reveal three CE implementation strategies correlated with CE development stages: integrated to value chain, focused on institutional compliance and fragmented profiles. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for the expansion of CE-related sectors based upon persons employed, value added or gross investments. This topic deserves further investigation, with important implications for future research and policymaking. Copyright © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Due to this surge of popularity, analyzing the data stored on blockchains poses a new critical challenge in data science. To assist data scientists in various analytic tasks for a blockchain, in this tutorial, we provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of the fundamental elements of blockchain network models.

	abstract = {The coffee value chain is a source of livelihood for millions of people across the world and yet the resilience of coffee is limited by the relatively narrow genetic base among commercial coffee cultivars. A study was conducted to determine genetic variation, heritability estimates and relationships among coffee genotypes in Zimbabwe. Quantitative morphological characteristics of twelve genotypes were recorded under field conditions. There were significant variations in coffee yield, plant height, stem girth, number of primary branches, number of bearing branches, internode length and leaf characteristics, with no significant variations in seed characteristics and number of nodes. Broad sense heritability estimates for the quantitative traits ranged from 0.03% to 91.4%, being highest for plant height, coffee yield, stem girth, leaf length and leaf area. The implications are that coffee yield and plant height are independent of significant environmental influences while seed, branching traits and leaf traits are influenced by the environment in their expression. Yield was significantly correlated to branches per plant, plant height, seed traits and stem girth. Clustering of genotypes was influenced by plant height, yield and stem girth. Overall, few traits were important in distinguishing coffee genotypes, implying narrow diversity. Hybridization, further introductions from other producer countries, coffee gene banks and/or introductions from the wild, and concerted germplasm conservation efforts are recommended. © 2022 by the Korean Society of Breeding Science},

	abstract = {Corn is the most widely grown crop in the U.S. and makes up a significant part of the American diet. Under the pressure of feeding a growing population, accurate and timely estimation of corn yield before the harvest is of great importance to supply chain management and regional food security. Recently, machine learning (ML) in conjunction with satellite remote sensing has been used for developing corn yield prediction models. Despite the success, a major bottleneck of training a reliable supervised ML model is the need for representative ground truth labels (e.g., yield records), which may be limited or even not available due to financial and manpower reasons. Also, due to domain shift, an ML model trained with labeled data from a label-rich region (i.e., source domain) could experience a significant performance decrease when directly applied to the region of interest (i.e., target domain). To address this issue, we proposed a Bayesian domain adversarial neural network (BDANN) for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on county-level corn yield prediction. By applying adversarial learning and Bayesian inference, BDANN was trained to reduce domain shift and accurately predict corn yield by extracting domain-invariant and task-informative features from both source and target domains. Moreover, the results also demonstrated that the BDANN model generalized well on small training sets. Experiments in two ecoregions in the U.S. corn belt have shown the effectiveness of the proposed BDANN and its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {While addressing supply chain planning under uncertainty, Robust Optimization (RO) is regarded as an efficient and tractable method. As RO involves calculation of several statistical moments or maximum / minimum values involving the objective functions under realizations of these uncertain parameters, the accuracy of this method significantly depends on the efficient techniques to sample the uncertainty parameter space with limited amount of data. Conventional sampling techniques, e.g. box/budget/ellipsoidal, work by sampling the uncertain parameter space inefficiently, often leading to inaccuracies in such estimations. This paper proposes a methodology to amalgamate machine learning and data analytics with RO, thereby making it data-driven. A novel neuro fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to cluster the uncertain space such that the exact regions of uncertainty are optimally identified. Subsequently, local density based boundary point detection and Delaunay triangulation based boundary construction enable intelligent Sobol based sampling to sample the uncertain parameter space more accurately. The proposed technique is utilized to explore the merits of RO towards addressing the uncertainty issues of product demand, machine uptime and production cost associated with a multiproduct, and multisite supply chain planning model. The uncertainty in supply chain model is thoroughly analysed by carefully constructing examples and its case studies leading to large scale mixed integer linear and nonlinear programming problems which were efficiently solved in GAMS® framework. Demonstration of efficacy of the proposed method over the box, budget and ellipsoidal sampling method through comprehensive analysis adds to other highlights of the current work. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things has grown significantly in recent years. While implementing industrial digitalization, automation, and intelligence introduced a slew of cyber risks, the complex and varied industrial Internet of Things environment provided a new attack surface for network attackers. As a result, conventional intrusion detection technology cannot satisfy the network threat discovery requirements in today's Industrial Internet of Things environment. In this research, the authors have used reinforcement learning rather than supervised and unsupervised learning, because it could very well improve the decision-making ability of the learning process by integrating abstract thinking of complete understanding, using deep knowledge to perform simple and nonlinear transformations of large-scale original input data into higher-level abstract expressions, and using learning algorithm or learning based on feedback signals, in the lack of guiding knowledge, which is based on the trial-and-error learning model, from the interaction with the environment to find the best good solution. In this respect, this article presents a near-end strategy optimization method for the Industrial Internet of Things intrusion detection system based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. This method combines deep learning's observation capability with reinforcement learning's decision-making capability to enable efficient detection of different kinds of cyberassaults on the Industrial Internet of Things. In this manuscript, the DRL-IDS intrusion detection system is built on a feature selection method based on LightGBM, which efficiently selects the most attractive feature set from industrial Internet of Things data; when paired with deep learning algorithms, it effectively detects intrusions. To begin, the application is based on GBM's feature selection algorithm, which extracts the most compelling feature set from Industrial Internet of Things data; then, in conjunction with the deep learning algorithm, the hidden layer of the multilayer perception network is used as the shared network structure for the value network and strategic network in the PPO2 algorithm; and finally, the intrusion detection model is constructed using the PPO2 algorithm and ReLU (R). Numerous tests conducted on a publicly available data set of the Industrial Internet of Things demonstrate that the suggested intrusion detection system detects 99 percent of different kinds of network assaults on the Industrial Internet of Things. Additionally, the accuracy rate is 0.9%. The accuracy, precision, recall rate, F1 score, and other performance indicators are superior to those of the existing intrusion detection system, which is based on deep learning models such as LSTM, CNN, and RNN, as well as deep reinforcement learning models such as DDQN and DQN.  © 2022 Sumegh Tharewal et al.},

	abstract = {Blockchain represents an evolving technology for distributed and secure recording and sharing of information. Meanwhile, blockchain has thrived in banking, finance, and supply chain; its usage within the construction industry is still in its infancy. To this end, the existing literature falls short in providing comprehensive quantitative understanding, within a systems-based analytic context, of the factors affecting blockchain utilization in construction applications. This paper fills this knowledge gap. The authors: (1) conducted an extensive literature review on blockchain implementation in the construction domain; (2) identified a list of 41 factors affecting blockchain implementation in construction projects categorized in four categories: challenges, needs, requirements, and capabilities; (3) utilized a social network analysis (SNA) approach on a database of 111 publications to quantitatively analyze the literature as related to the aforementioned factors; and (4) performed clustering analysis on the SNA graphs to determine the combinations of factors that are most likely co-occurring in research publications. SNA results indicate that while the most investigated factor was “increased trust and transparency between project parties”, the least studied factors included: “cash upfront funding system”, “change payment processes and procedures”, “smart contracts design errors”, “cryptocurrency fluctuations”, “lack of sufficiently skilled personnel”, and “increased awareness and capabilities of personnel”. Also, clustering outcomes highlight that some combinations of factors are not well-represented in current scholarly efforts. Such imbalance and consequent knowledge gaps may contribute to the actual implementation rate of blockchain in construction applications. Ultimately, this paper provides a roadmap for potential future directions of blockchain construction-related research. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Industrial clusters are considered more resource- and greenhouse gas-efficient than stand-alone industrial plants, but clustering may also act as a barrier to radical changes required for deep greenhouse gas emission reductions. Here we explore how clustering in an energy-intensive chemical industry cluster may influence attainability of the deep emission reduction targets. Chemelot, located in the southeast of the Netherlands, was willing to collaborate and we adopt a qualitative system dynamics approach based on expert interviews and group model building sessions. We found that clustering may hinder reaching deep emission reductions by three reinforcing feedback mechanisms, or ‘traps’, related to: incremental changes; short-term focus; and companies acting alone. The system dynamics analysis also identified potential mechanisms to escape from these traps, notably: (1) increasing cluster autonomy; (2) activating public support; (3) promoting changes in the supply chain; and (4) attracting long-term investors. The findings can inform policymakers on how to steer industrial clusters towards deep emission reductions, and support industrial cluster decision-makers on both internal and external strategies. Key policy insights Industrial clustering may offer opportunities to accelerate deep greenhouse gas emission reductions, but it could also cause carbon lock-in because of increased physical and organizational interdependency, which favours incremental changes, short-term focus, and solitary actions rather than collective actions, at the cost of deep greenhouse gas emission reductions. To fully exploit the potential benefits of industrial clustering for greenhouse gas emission reductions, policies need to take into account the causal relations that operate in a self-reinforcing way to lock the cluster into high greenhouse gas emissions, and that can help escape them. A coordinating authority operating across the cluster is necessary to ensure effective collaboration within a chemical cluster so as to escape carbon lock-in. Policies addressing emissions along the full value chain (i.e. to include scope 3) might be mutually beneficial with the circularity and low-emission ambitions of the chemical industry. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The paper deals with the relevant problem of industrial development in Russia’s regions. For the economic development of regions at a qualitatively new level, innovative clusters are an effective form of organizing industrial business. The positive effects of clustering are achieved, first of all, by combining the scientific and production potential of the territory. To model the processes of interregional clustering, the method of spatial econometrics based on Moran’s indices was used. The results of the study show that a number of Russian regions have a high potential for the creation and development of interregional ties. The development of industrial clustering at the interregional level can help to level the socio-economic development of regions. Relations between promising regions and those being sharply inferior to them in development, in the form of clusters, can lead to synergistic effects. It has been established that interregional interaction in traditional industries, such as metallurgy and mechanical engineering, is not always mutually beneficial. Territories of catching-up development can become resource donors in such relations. The authors have noted the priority of supporting interregional clusters, including high-tech enterprises. High-tech manufacturing is an active link in value chains. Therefore, the formation of interregional clustering in this area should become a strategic direction of industrial policy. © 2021 KIIE},

	abstract = {Competition between companies is getting more intense by the day. Corporations need to decrease costs while improving the quality and reliability of their deliveries. Meanwhile, the demand for environmentally sustainable products and operations is increasing. These issues are all compounded by the supplier relations between companies and their need to develop better economic and environmental supply chain contracts. This research thus aims to propose a tool, i.e., the MOSS Software, concerning the total cost, rate of defected materials, rate of late deliveries, and environmental improvement potential for suppliers. MOSS is a two-stage software. First, the objectives are included in a multi-objective evolutionary mathematical model, and the model is solved using the NSGA-III algorithm. In the second stage, as a post-Pareto analysis approach, the kmeans algorithm is used for selecting representative solutions among Pareto sets by comparing silhouette values for different k values. An application of the MOSS software is also presented in this paper. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},

	abstract = {One of the major issues the agri-food supply chains is the considerable production of by-products, which are mostly discarded as wastes and dangerously landfilled. This problem is particularly acute in the coffee supply chain: coffee cultivation generates by-products and in quantities which are potentially dangerous for the environment. A circular economy business model aimed at the recovery of these by-products may represent an interesting solution in terms of environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The goal of this paper was to provide teachers and educators with case material on circular business models that can be used for problem-based learning and case-based learning activities. The proposed case was built to address a real-world problematic situation related to the coffee supply chain. From a theoretical point of view, this study contributes to the literature on circular economy business models by providing a case study developed in the context of a developing country. Furthermore, the research entails practical implications since it shows managers and startuppers how to map a circular business model in all its components under the guidance of a conceptual framework. © 2021 by the authors.

So to develop an ISM–MICMAC-based framework, at first, CSR initiatives were chosen from existing literature with experts’ advice. Later, MICMAC analysis results showed that “employee trainings and workshops” and “employee welfare and empowerment” are significant CSR initiatives that could help CSR’s integration in the food sector of Pakistan, whereas CSR initiatives “community betterment” and “contribution towards economic development” proved least significant in the model. This study recommends that food sector firms should promote employee-based strategies in the firms.

However, the identification of high leakage areas in urban water distribution networks lacks visual model-driven approaches. In the current study, the model parameters of the water distribution network (i.e., leakage point density, pipe age and material, road load, and average pressure of the pipe network) were collected in Haidian Island, Hainan Province, China as a case. The virtual district metering area (V-DMA) was used to modularize the water distribution network. A visual analytic hierarchical process (V-AHP) based on the V-DMA was established for identifying the leakage high-risk areas in the V-DMA. The first and second-level discriminant matrices (i.e., subjective and objective weights, respectively) were calculated based on the model parameters. Integration of V-AHP with V-DMA reveals insight into high leakage areas of urban water distribution networks, which was consistent with in-situ observations. Overall, this study provides a simple, efficient, and practically applicable method for identifying the leakage areas in water distribution networks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Given a set of data points, a clustering algorithm aims to classify each data-points into a specific group. Each group should have similar properties and/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features. The motivation of this study follows. Firstly, an improved metaheuristic algorithm named ISCA is proposed as a new data clustering technique to improve and incorporate a variety of PI-SCN decisions. By this framework, we propose a tool to make clear decisions for enterprise proprietors. The robustness of the proposed approach is tested against five recent metaheuristics using twelve benchmark datasets.

In particular, for both business partners, cost information is highly relevant in purchasing situations. According to empirical studies in literature, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are expected to have a great potential to reveal cost structures by machine learning (ML). In digitally enabled supply chains this information can contribute to cost reduction and operational excellence and lead to win-win situations in supplier relationship management. Nevertheless, authors do not thoroughly investigate how ANNs may support cost estimation for purchasing decisions. Based on a case study from the automotive industry, we evaluate ANNs regarding their capability to gain cost structure data. In an additional comparative study, we benchmark ANNs for cost estimation in purchasing against other promising ML algorithms. Thereby, we apply the cross-industry standard process model for data mining projects. The findings of the studies show that some ML algorithms outperform ANNs regarding accuracy. The research results give indications for choosing the ML approach that promises the best outcome for cost estimations and cost structure information to support decision-making in buyer–supplier relationships. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

For this purpose, it is necessary to be able to make a real-time prediction about the current and future process conditions even at high production rates. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of data acquisition, preprocessing and transformation on the performance of a multiclass support vector machine to classify abrasive wear states during blanking based on force signals. The performance of the model was quantitatively evaluated based on the model accuracy and the separability of the classes. As a result, it was shown, that the deviation of time series represents the key parameter for the resulting performance of the classification model and strongly depends on the sensor type and position, the preprocessing procedure as well as the feature extraction and selection. Furthermore, it is shown that the consideration of domain knowledge in the phases of data acquisition, preprocessing and transformation improves the performance of the classification model and is essential to successfully implement AI projects. Summarizing the findings of this study, trustworthy data sets play a crucial role for implementing an automated process monitoring as a basis for resilient manufacturing systems. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The routing of commodities is a tactical problem in supply chain management that aims to synchronise transportation services connecting a network of warehouses and consolidation locations. This paper considers the routing of commodities in a transportation network that is flexible in response to demand through changes to regional warehouse clustering and the designation of consolidation locations. Traditionally, warehouse clustering and consolidation locations are determined as part of strategic planning that is performed months to years in advance of operations—limiting the flexibility in transportation networks to respond to changes in demand. A mathematical programming-based algorithmic framework is proposed to integrate the strategic decisions of location planning with tactical decisions of vehicle routing and synchronisation. A multi-armed bandit problem is developed to explore warehouse clustering decisions and exploit those that lead to small transportation costs. An extensive computational study will show that the proposed algorithmic framework effectively integrates strategic and tactical planning decisions to reduce the overall transportation costs. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: This paper presents a bibliometric overview of research published application of social network analysis in supply chain management in recent decades. It may be useful for showing the most important problems in this area. With this aim, Citespace is used to analyse the literature on the application of social network analysis in supply chain management to clarify the development and research trend. Bibliometric analysis is the quantitative study of bibliographic material. It provides a general picture of a research field that can be classified by papers, authors, and journals. The main objective of this study is to investigate the knowledge domain about application social network analysis in the supply chain field and reveal the thematic patterns and topics of high interest to researchers to predict emerging trends in the literature. Methods: To investigate the growth of studies about the applicable social network in supply chain management, 647 articles were reviewed by CiteSpace software. These papers were collected from the Core Collection of Thomson Reuters and published in 16 journals in operations research and management science from 2004 to 2021. Document co-citation analysis, clustering analysis, and citation burst detection were conducted to investigate and examine the thematic patterns, emerging trends, and critical articles of the knowledge domain. Results: Social network approaches are increasingly popular in the supply chain. Four major clusters are discussed in detail, namely multi-objective optimization, sustainable supply chain, supply network, and circular economy. Three research trends of supply chain network design, structural characteristics, and supplier selection and evaluation were identified based on citation bursts analysis. Conclusions: The present study offers a new approach to visualizing relevant data to synthesize scientific research findings of the application of social network analysis in supply chain management. Additionally, directions for future research in this area are presented. © Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The literature on Maritime Transportation (MT) is experiencing a transition phase where the focus of the research is repositioning. It registered steep growth in recent years with its beginning articles on the concepts of cost minimization to the current focus on achieving sustainable operational effectiveness using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Thus, this becomes a right time to investigate the trajectory of research on MT. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed study aims to explore the potential of data analytics techniques such as data mining and network analytics to reflect the trajectory of research in the maritime supply chain over time. This study identifies the eight main dimensions of the research published under maritime paradigm through network analytics. The in-depth review of these dimensions rendered us to segregate them further into sub-dimensions for the ease of understanding and interpretability. Further, the text mining is employed to extract thematic evolution of the research. Findings: The evolved themes are completely exclusive from the conventional MT research with artificial intelligence, digital storage, waste management and biofuels emerging as contemporary themes. It is found that although there are a sufficient amount of literature on sustainable port practices but their policy implications are still underexplored. The inter-dimension research is needed to achieve the motive of economic efficiency and environmental sustainability simultaneously. Originality/value: The study has contributed on the methodology side of conducting literature reviews. The dimensions, sub-dimensions and themes are obtained using data analytics tools and techniques. This omits the possibility of personal bias and thus making the results verifiable. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Balanced scorecard (BSC) can be defined as a popular performance measurement method that can translate the strategy into a set of performance indicators and manage the status of implementing the various strategies. However, BSC is unable to simulate the complicated environment and the dynamic behavior of performance metrics. Therefore, the author combines BSC with system dynamics (SD) to explore a more efficient tool for measurement SCP. Design/methodology/approach: A dynamic causal model is proposed based on the causal hypotheses. The developed DBSC enables managers to evaluate and measure the SCP in a much-balanced way. Using DBSC makes it possible that different SCP metrics to be reviewed and distributed into the four above-mentioned perspectives. It also enables supply chain (SC) managers to evaluate different strategies to improve SCP. Findings: investigates two strategies to improve SCP as follows: (1) competitive strategy and (2) harvesting big data and using data mining techniques to determine the customer's expectations and then compares the results of these two strategies based on the four perspectives of DBSC and introduce the best strategy. Finally, harvesting big data and data mining is selected as the best strategy.

	abstract = {Blockchain is one of the most anticipated technology revolutions, with immense promise in various applications. It is a distributed and encrypted database that can address a range of challenges connected to online security and trust. While many people identify Blockchain with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, it has a wide range of applications in supply chain management, health, Internet of Things (IoT), education, identity theft prevention, logistics, and the execution of digital smart contracts. Although Blockchain Technology (BT) has numerous advantages for Decentralized Applications (DApps), it is nevertheless vulnerable to abuse, smart contract failures, security, theft, trespassing, and other concerns. As a result, using Machine Learning (ML) models to detect anomalies is an excellent way to detect and safeguard blockchain networks from criminal activity. Adapting ensemble learning methods in ML to create better prediction outcomes is a viable approach for anomaly identification. Ensemble learning, as the name implies, refers to creating a stronger and more accurate classification by combining the prediction results of numerous weak models. As a result, an in-depth evaluation of ensemble learning methodologies for anomaly detection in the blockchain network ecosystem is applied in this paper. It comprises numerous ensemble methods (e.g., averaging, voting, stacking, boosting, bagging). The review collects data from three established databases, which are Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and Google Scholar. Specific keywords are employed, such as Blockchain, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Anomaly Detection, and Ensemble Learning, employing advanced searching algorithms. The results of the search found 60 primary articles from 2017 to 2022 (30 from Scopus, 20 from the WoS, and 10 from Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we decided to divide our debate into three primary themes: (1) the fundamentals of Blockchain Technology (BT), (2) the overview of ensemble learning, and (3) the integration and analysis of ensemble learning in blockchain networks for anomaly detection.

However, the parameter cannot be accurately measured in real life. This paper provides a method based on prior information to solve this issue. First, compared to classical concept lattice theory, the interval concept lattice theory can deal with uncertain information more accurately. It is used to extract the objects within the interval parameters [α, β], and then interval concepts and lattice structure are built. Second, based on the interval concepts and lattice structure, the association rule mining algorithm is designed to further extract the association rules under different interval parameters. Third, to obtain the effective association degree between two objects, the rule optimization algorithm is put forward by comparing the update of rules. Finally, the association degree can indirectly reflect the substitutability between products. Then the price of a new product can be determined.

	abstract = {The last decades have seen a growing interest in construction management amongst scholars, particularly, in how to apply supply chain management (SCM) strategies to improve logistics efficiency and project performance. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which integrate multiple quantitative methods to synthesise the literature on construction logistics and supply chain management (CLSCM) and analyse their trends during the last two decades. In this work, we concurrently deploy the rigorous six-step SLR protocol together with co-citation analysis, factor analysis, multidimensional scaling-based fuzzy k-means clustering, and keyword extraction and co-occurrence analysis to ascertain and examine clusters of CLSCM application. The results show that there are six established research clusters in CLSCM, namely, logistics and SCM for prefabricated construction, construction procurement, construction supply chain integration, green construction SCM, reverse logistics in construction and onsite construction logistics. Amongst these clusters, construction supply chain integration plays the most integral role. Informed by this ascertained knowledge structure, we explore the research trends during the period reviewed, propose a conceptual framework for CLSCM and suggest research avenues. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The majority of existing studies focuses on sensitivity or burst identification ability of monitoring systems based on certain specific operating conditions of WSNs, while nodal connectivity or long-term hydraulic fluctuation is not fully considered and analyzed. A new method of pressure sensor placement is proposed in this paper based on Graph Neural Networks. The method mainly consists of two steps: monitoring partition establishment and sensor placement. (1) Structural Deep Clustering Network algorithm is used for clustering analysis with the integration of complicated topological and hydraulic characteristics, and a WSN is divided into several monitoring partitions. (2) Then, sensor placement is carried out based on burst identification analysis, a quantitative metric named “indicator tensor” is developed to calculate hydraulic characteristics in time series, and the node with the maximum average partition perception rate is selected as the sensor in each monitoring partition. The results showed that the proposed method achieved a better monitoring scheme with more balanced distribution of sensors and higher coverage rate for pipe burst detection. This paper offers a new robust framework, which can be easily applied in the decision-making process of monitoring system establishment. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Several supply chain risk management approaches have been revisited or reapplied in the literature; however, collaborative resource sharing is less researched. This study aimed to investigate the current academic state of the art and advances in using collaborative resource sharing as a reactive method to facilitate supply chain recovery in the presence of disruptive events. More specifically we considered the role of different collaborative resource-sharing strategies that organizations can adopt to support supply chain functionalities during times of disruption. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to analyze academic articles that were published online from 2000 to 2022. In order to analyze the literature, we adopted a combination of text-mining, automatic and manual categorization of selected articles, and exploratory analyses such as cluster analysis and relational indicators. We also consider the machine learning classification algorithm i.e. agglomerative hierarchical clustering for the categorization of clusters. The findings show that, for disruptive risks, collaborative sharing of labour and material resources is effective for the recovery of supply chains. More so, labour resources tend to contribute more to the recovery of supply chains through the physical and mental recreation of recovery activities and experiences. Whilst information resources and a mix of information and material resources are highly important in reducing the impact of COVID-19 disruptive supply chain risk. In conclusion, collaborating on the three resources, namely labour, material, and information resources can be an effective post-disruption recovery strategy for supply chains.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The main aim of the study is to forecast material demand and provide data support for decision-makers. The system includes a data centre subsystem and an application subsystem. At the same time, two kinds of collaborative transmission process models of supply chain information are established, and simulation analysis is carried out on the two models by the Monte Carlo method to verify the effect of collaborative transmission of information flow in supply chains within big data environments. The major contribution of the work is the design of a supply chain model with the help of big data. The impacts of the Internet of Things with empirical studies and limited models are the focuses of the study. It can be seen from the simulation results that there will be a minimum (Formula presented.) to minimise the cost (Formula presented.) under the two supply chain information-transfer process models. The manufacturing cost of the big data platform is about (Formula presented.) lower than that of the traditional supply chain, and increased delay costs accordingly lead to increased costs for manufacturers in both supply chains. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {In modern systems, there is a tendency to model issues more accurately with low computational cost and considering multiscale decision-making which increases the complexity of the optimization. Therefore, it is necessary to develop tools to cope with these new challenges. Supply chain management of enterprise-wide operations usually involves three decision levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. These decision levels depend on each other involving different time scales. Accordingly, their integration usually leads to multiscale models that are computationally intractable. In this work, the aim is to develop novel clustering methods with multiple attributes to tackle the integrated problem. As a result, a clustering structure is proposed in the form of a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) later converted into a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for clustering shape-based time series data with multiple attributes through a multi-objective optimization approach (since different attributes have different scales or units) and minimize the computational complexity of multiscale decision problems. The results show that normal clustering is closer to the optimal case (full-scale model) compared with sequence clustering. Additionally, it provides improved solution quality due to flexibility in terms of sequence restrictions. The developed clustering algorithms can work with any two-dimensional datasets and simultaneous demand patterns. The most suitable applications of the clustering algorithms are long-term planning and integrated scheduling and planning problems. To show the performance of the proposed method, it is investigated on an energy hub as a case study, the results show a significant reduction in computational cost with accuracies ranging from 95.8% to 98.3%. © 2021 by the authors.

We assume that the resulting quality level of the product at every step is stochastic. We also consider that this quality level at each supply chain step has a minimum accepted level and any product that does not meet the minimum accepted level is rejected. We propose an integrated approach that uses Big Data mining techniques to study the effect of these decisions on the quality of the final product and determine our state transition matrix. From there, stochastic optimization methods are implemented to find an optimal policy describing the preferred suppliers and settings for their process parameters. The goal of this policy is to maximize the supply chain's expected profit and reduce rejected product. We show how this technique outperforms traditional techniques in running time as the problem's complexity (state and action space size) grows. We also conduct experiments to explore how the optimal policy changes as the quality threshold for acceptance becomes more restrictive and exhibits a convex behavior. © 2020},

In the context of industrial convergence, the users’ medical business needs also show a trend of diversification and personalization. The phenomenon of multi-service resource crossing and multi-organization information barriers in the traditional medical supply chain lead to a lag in the medical resource recommendation time, which makes medical enterprises face the problem of reducing the efficiency of information resource flow in industrial interconnection businesses. This study thus constructed a collaborative recommendation model of medical services based on a cloud platform by mining the characteristics of dynamic medical service resources and user demand, and used a singular value decomposition algorithm based on time context to solve the model so as to achieve reasonable recommendation of dynamic multi-service resources in the medical supply chain. The results showed that the proposed collaborative recommendation model of dynamic medical business resources based on the cloud platform can effectively achieve medical business recommendations and provide ideas for reducing the operating costs of medical enterprise alliances under the condition of industrial interconnection and improving the efficiency of industrial resource interconnection. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

However, the current challenges facing companies, such as rising process and supply chain complexity, as well as high volumes of unstructured data, cannot easily be answered by relying on traditional Six Sigma tools. Instead, the Process Mining (PM) technology using big data analytics promises valuable support for 6S and its data analysis capabilities. The article presents a design science research project in which a method for the integration of PM in Six Sigma's DMAIC project structure was developed. This method could be extended, refined and tested during three evaluation cycles: an expert evaluation with Six Sigma professionals, a technical experiment and finally a multi case study in a company. The method therefore was eventually endorsed by 6S experts and successfully applied in a first pilot setting. This article presents the first developed method for the integration of PM and Six Sigma. It follows the recommendations of many researchers to test Six Sigma as an application field of PM as well as using the potential of big data analytics. The method can be used by researchers and practitioners alike to implement, test and verify its design in organisations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The national broadcast service providers in China have been involved in a fierce battle with various new providers from each node of the supply chain. Although there are historical advantages, customer churn rate has been increasing in recent years. To better respond to market competition, national broadcast service providers such as cable network enterprises should recognize customer preference and forecast customer churn intention before the competition does. Based on a positivist approach, customer churn is related to watching intensity, consumption amount, and paying habits. Watching preference (as the exclusive resource) has only a moderate effect on customer watching intensity and customer churn. In order to explore the mechanism between variables and observe user retention strategies, in-depth interviews were conducted. This study provides references to similar major traditional enterprises in the new competition era. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Off-site construction (OSC) is an innovative and sustainable construction method. One of its critical success factors is the proper management of its supply chain (SC). Recently, significant research attention has been focused on the modelling of OSC-SC to improve its performance and sustainability. However, the literature still lacks a comprehensive review of the modelling studies on off-site construction -supply chain management (OSC-SCM). Therefore, this research contributes by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date mapping and clustering of 309 journal articles on the modelling of OSC-SC to identify its trends and gaps, and hence, highlight future research opportunities. To achieve these objectives, a mixed review method, consisting of scientometric and systematic reviews, is used. The scientometric review identifies the most prolific journals, researchers, co-occurrence network of keywords, and their citation bursts. On the other hand, the systematic review classifies the articles based on OSC type and supply chain (SC) stage. At each SC stage, the articles are further classified based on problem settings and solution methods. The results show that production problems have received the most attention (i.e., by 28% of the included articles), followed by on-site construction (19%), design (13%), and logistics (7%) problems. However, researchers are more inclined to address problems at multiple SC stages (33%) due to the interrelationship between these stages. Besides, the systematic analysis shows that OSC-SC problems have been solved frequently by a variety of solution methods such as optimization (25%), simulation (13%) and building information modelling (BIM) (9.5%). However, researchers tend more to integrate multiple solution methods (35%) to address the complexities of OSC-SC problems. Finally, the included studies are classified based on the three sustainability dimensions. The results show that economic, environmental, and social sustainability dimensions have been considered in previous studies by 72%, 24%, and 4%, respectively. Therefore, the study identifies research gaps at each SC stage of each OSC type to incentivize future studies to consider more environmental and social sustainability factors in OSC-SC models. Since modular integrated construction (MiC) has the highest prefabrication level, this study provides future research directions for sustainable supply chain management (SCM) in MiC. The present research is an important reference guide that helps researchers and practitioners to understand different problem settings and their solution methods in OSC-SCM. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The methodological approach is introduced and illustrated by the use case of service provider documents in purchasing processes.

	abstract = {In the automotive industry, cost estimation of components to be purchased plays an important role for price negotiations with suppliers and, therefore, for cost control within the supply chain. While traditional bottom-up cost estimation is a very time consuming and know-how intensive process, intelligent machine learning methods have the potential to significantly reduce the effort in the cost estimation process. In this paper, a literature review on intelligent cost estimation methods for parts to be procured in the manufacturing industry is carried out by text mining. Following the results of this literature review, building blocks for an intelligent cost estimation system are outlined that comprise cost estimation methods, dimensionality reduction methods, methods for multi-level cost estimation, and methods for interpreting the results of the cost analysis. Regarding cost estimation methods, Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines outperform established linear regression algorithms. Dimensionality reduction methods like Correlation Analysis or Principal Component Analysis are rarely studied. Nevertheless, they contribute a lot to the reduction of expensively provided input parameters for cost estimation. Methods for multi-level cost estimation, that support cost prediction of parts and assemblies following the construction plan of a vehicle, and methods for interpretation of intelligent cost analytics cannot be found at all in literature. Consequently, in this paper corresponding approaches are derived from the areas of Multitask Learning and Explainable Machine Learning. Finally, a combination of methods considered most suitable for predictive analytics to estimate procurement costs is presented. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Fishery-based activity for small island regions created more complicated problems that limited marine resources and high production costs. Thus, the need to develop efficient and effective tools for interconnecting supply and production becomes more crucial than ever to help local coastal communities. This study aimed to designs a web-based DSS for a sustainable supply chain of sectors in Southeast Maluku Regency, Indonesia (SIRIPIKAN). Firstly, we crafted the DSS framework to identify the fishing, supplier, and seller locations. Secondly, we measured the level of sustainability of marine resources. Thirdly, the web-based DSS can help local coastal communities increase managers' capability and ability in the fisheries-related business activity carried out. SIRIPIKAN aims to increase the profitability of fisheries business activities in coastal communities and preserve marine resources. This research combined the data mining activities with spatial analysis to obtain the cluster support map and MSY to measure sustainability and feasibility study as an approach for the development of the system. The model provides an integrated sustainable production with users' input used to optimize the decision-making process of profitability and sustainability in existing marine resources. © 2021.

In this paper, we propose two data-driven approaches that allow making better decisions in supply chain management. In particular, we suggest a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network-based method for forecasting multivariate time series data and an LSTM Autoencoder network-based method combined with a one-class support vector machine algorithm for detecting anomalies in sales. Unlike other approaches, we recommend combining external and internal company data sources for the purpose of enhancing the performance of forecasting algorithms using multivariate LSTM with the optimal hyperparameters. In addition, we also propose a method to optimize hyperparameters for hybrid algorithms for detecting anomalies in time series data. The proposed approaches will be applied to both benchmarking datasets and real data in fashion retail. The obtained results show that the LSTM Autoencoder based method leads to better performance for anomaly detection compared to the LSTM based method suggested in a previous study.

	abstract = {Recent IoT proliferation has undeniably affected the way organizational activities and business procedures take place within several IoT domains such as smart manufacturing, food supply chain, intelligent transportation systems, medical care infrastructures etc. The number of the interconnected edge devices has dramatically increased, creating a huge volume of transferred data susceptible to leakage, modification or disruption, ultimately affecting the security level, robustness and QoS of the attacked IoT ecosystem. In an attempt to prevent or mitigate network abnormalities while accommodating the cohesiveness among the involved entities, modeling their interrelations and incorporating their structural, content and temporal attributes, graph-based anomaly detection solutions have been repeatedly adopted. In this article we propose, a multi-agent system, with each agent implementing a Graph Neural Network, in order to exploit the collaborative and cooperative nature of intelligent agents for anomaly detection. To this end, against the propagating nature of cyber-attacks such as the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), we propose a distributed detection scheme, which aims to monitor efficiently the entire network infrastructure. To fulfill this task, we consider employing monitors on active network nodes such as IoT devices, SDN forwarders, Fog Nodes, achieving localization of anomaly detection, distribution of allocated resources such as the bandwidth and power consumption and higher accuracy results. In order to facilitate the training, testing and evaluation activities of the Graph Neural Network algorithm, we create simulated datasets of network flows of various normal and abnormal distributions, out of which we extract essential structural and content features to be passed to neighbouring agents. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {It is a difficult time for the world's economics while the impact of COVID-19 is undergoing. A possible worldwide sovereign debt crisis could emerge, in short term, for supply chains blockage due to its slowing-down in many countries. China, having the second largest economy in the world, is crucial for the stability and sustainability of the economic recovery. China endures a long-term growth since 2000; nevertheless, a large amount of that growth is contributed by the government debt, which was spent on infrastructures. The accumulation of debts is a potential risk to the future growth of China. This research evaluates the central government and local government debts with a series of indicators. The weights of indicators are determined by objective methods of the CRITIC approach. Results confirm that the central government debt of China is on the edge of risk, while the risk of local governments debt is already in a concerning danger. The local government risk is 50% higher than the central government's risk. Moreover, the K-means clustering algorithm performed on data, collected from various provinces, suggests that the local government debts of China follow a pattern of geographical distribution; that is, the closer to the coast, the lesser the risk, which is in accordance with the pattern of labor flowing. Labors are attracted by job opportunities which lie in the well-developed regions of China. This is confirmed by the crosscheck with the wage growth data. This indicates that the less developed areas of China rely more heavily on debt-investment stimulation that could be of a potential stagnation because the yield of investment follows diminishing marginal returns and the relative lacking labor weakens the potential economic growth.  © 2021 Tianhao Ouyang and Xiaoyong Lu.},

The purpose of this study is to develop an effective green supplier evaluation model. Currently the evaluation criteria are determined through a literature review combined with decision-maker opinions. A few studies have used data mining techniques to screen the core criteria. This study proposes a novel hybrid MCDM model, that integrates the support vector machine (SVM), the fuzzy best worst method (FBWM) and, the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (FTOPSIS) approaches to select the most suitable green suppliers. A case study, using data from a multinational electronics manufacturer, is carried out for illustration. First, the SVM is used to extract the core criteria from the historical data. The original 25 criteria are reduced to 13 criteria. Then, the FBWM is used to obtain the weights of the core criteria. Finally, the FTOPSIS is used to integrate the performance and prioritize the green suppliers. Finally, practical management implications and suggestions for improvement for decision-makers and green suppliers are provided © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Accurate oil market forecasting plays an important role in the theory and application of oil supply chain management for profit maximization and risk minimization. However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has compelled governments worldwide to impose restrictions, consequently forcing the closure of most social and economic activities. The latter leads to the volatility of the oil markets and poses a huge challenge to oil market forecasting. Fortunately, the social media information can finely reflect oil market factors and exogenous factors, such as conflicts and political instability. Accordingly, this study collected vast online oil news and used convolutional neural network to extract relevant information automatically. Oil markets are divided into four categories: oil price, oil production, oil consumption, and oil inventory. A total of 16,794; 9,139; 8,314; and 8,548 news headlines were collected in four respective cases. Experimental results indicate that social media information contributes to the forecasting of oil price, oil production and oil consumption. The mean absolute percentage errors are respectively 0.0717, 0.0144 and 0.0168 for the oil price, production, and consumption prediction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Marketers must consider the impact of social media information on the oil or similar markets, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In recent years, the health sector has faced increasingly important challenges. Due to the economic crisis and competitions, hospitals are facing many issues affecting the supply chain, such as budget cuts or lack thereof as well as insufficient human resources. Although essential for an excellent service, logistics take up a considerable part of the budget as challenges need to be addressed such as delays in drugs delivery, transportation and storage conditions, routing and scheduling. As to governance, each hospital is assigned to a specific region, which cannot be defined due to political, demographic, or geographic issues. This paper focuses on multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) in healthcare logistics to feed the hospital pharmacies. The idea is to apply MDVRP’s approach to the health sector, specifically hospital pharmacies. In this projection, hospitals are considered to present clients, and central pharmacies present deposits. This problem (the MDVRP) is known by this nature NP-hard. For that, the heuristic method was used as genetic algorithm to solve the problem. The paper is organized as follows, the first section discusses, compares, and proposes clustering methods for healthcare facilities with applying them on Moroccan hospitals case; the second section proposes a genetic algorithm to resolve the MDVRP with a simulation.

	abstract = {The efficiency of inventory management determines the customers’ buying experience, so a supply chain network with a shorter replenishment time is needed. The supply chain network is hoped to be robust to the stock-out of some distributors in the network under random customer demands. At the same time, replenishment path optimization method with the objective of minimizing the replenishment time is required. After reviewing previous work done in the field of supply network topology, scale-free network is proven to be efficient when it was used to model supply network. In addition, multi-agent based collaborative replenishment model is smarter. But, there is rare research on multi-agent based collaborative replenishment in the supply chain modelled by scale-free network. In this study, we proposed a spare parts supply chain network model based on a novel scale-free network. In this network growth process, the connection probability function of connecting new distributor to the existing distributors in the network, is constructed considering the connection number (for an existing distributor, its connection number means the number of other distributors which have collaborative relationship with it) and inventory capacity of the existing distributors and the transit time between new distributor and existing distributors. The connection probability function is built from the standpoints of both new distributor and the existing distributors. Furthermore, different selection policies are discussed in the network growth process to improve the efficiency. Unlike other replenishment path optimization methods, Q learning takes the advantage of interacting with the environment to make a dynamic decision. So, Q learning is selected to optimize the replenishment path in supply chain network. In the experiment, network static and dynamic performance is analyzed using the indicators: degree distribution, clustering coefficient, centrality and response time. Experimental results showed that the replenishment time of supply chain network which are optimized by Q learning is reduced by approximately 40%. So, the shorter replenishment time of the supply chain network is verified. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, a multi-hierarchy industrial virtual water network model (MIVWN) was developed for analyzing the status of varied industrial sectors in the virtual-water system. A special case study for Hubei Province, China, was conducted to demonstrate the potential profits of its use in the formulation of water-resource management related legislation. Specifically, multi-hierarchy scenarios for system identification were performed to get more insights on the complex interrelationships among various industrial sectors. It is found that the industrial sectors have low water-use efficiency; and the mutual connections of virtual water between various industrial sectors are limited in Hubei. For the substantial industrial sectors, it is of vital importance to upgrade the upstream and downstream supply chains. For the isolated sectors, the decision maker should commit to enhance their virtual water exchanges with other sectors. It is expected that the results will provide a solid basis for supporting the application of an effective water-resource management strategies for industrial sectors. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The role of anonymous online marketplaces and forums that resemble eBay or Amazon, where anyone can post, browse, and purchase opioid commodities, has become increasingly important in opioid trading. Therefore, a greater understanding of anonymous markets and forums may enable public health officials and other stakeholders to comprehend the scope of the crisis. However, to the best of our knowledge, no large-scale study, which may cross multiple anonymous marketplaces and is cross-sectional, has been conducted to profile the opioid supply chain and unveil characteristics of opioid suppliers, commodities, and transactions. Objective: We aimed to profile the opioid supply chain in anonymous markets and forums via a large-scale, longitudinal measurement study on anonymous market listings and posts. Toward this, we propose a series of techniques to collect data; identify opioid jargon terms used in the anonymous marketplaces and forums; and profile the opioid commodities, suppliers, and transactions. Methods: We first conducted a whole-site crawl of anonymous online marketplaces and forums to solicit data. We then developed a suite of opioid domain-specific text mining techniques (eg, opioid jargon detection and opioid trading information retrieval) to recognize information relevant to opioid trading activities (eg, commodities, price, shipping information, and suppliers). Subsequently, we conducted a comprehensive, large-scale, longitudinal study to demystify opioid trading activities in anonymous markets and forums. Results: A total of 248,359 listings from 10 anonymous online marketplaces and 1,138,961 traces (ie, threads of posts) from 6 underground forums were collected. Among them, we identified 28,106 opioid product listings and 13,508 opioid-related promotional and review forum traces from 5147 unique opioid suppliers' IDs and 2778 unique opioid buyers' IDs. Our study characterized opioid suppliers (eg, activeness and cross-market activities), commodities (eg, popular items and their evolution), and transactions (eg, origins and shipping destination) in anonymous marketplaces and forums, which enabled a greater understanding of the underground trading activities involved in international opioid supply and demand. Conclusions: The results provide insight into opioid trading in the anonymous markets and forums and may prove an effective mitigation data point for illuminating the opioid supply chain. © Zhengyi Li, Xiangyu Du, Xiaojing Liao, Xiaoqian Jiang, Tiffany Champagne-Langabeer.

	abstract = {Root cause analysis for quality problem solving is critical to improve product quality performance and reduce the quality risk for manufacturers. Subjective conventional methods have been applied frequently in past decades. However, due to increasingly complex product and supply chain structures, diverse working conditions, and massive amounts of components, accuracy and efficiency of root cause analysis are progressively challenged in practice. Therefore, data-driven root cause analysis methods have attracted attention lately. In this paper, taking advantage of the availability of big operations data and the rapid development of data science, we design a big data-driven root cause analysis system utilizing Machine Learning techniques to improve the performance of root cause analysis. More specifically, we first propose a conceptual framework of the big data-driven root cause analysis system including three modules of Problem Identification, Root Cause Identification, and Permanent Corrective Action. Furthermore, in the Problem Identification Module, we construct a unified feature-based approach to describe multiple and different types of quality problems by applying a data mining method. In the Root Cause Identification Module, we use supervised Machine Learning (classification) methods to automatically predict the root causes of multiple quality problems. Finally, we illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed system and algorithms based on actual quality data from a case company. This study contributes to the literature from the following aspects: (i) the integrated system and algorithms can be used directly to develop a computer application to manage and solve quality problems with high concurrences and complexities in any manufacturing process; (ii) a general procedure and method are provided to formulate and describe a large quantity and different types of quality problems; (iii) compared with traditional methods, it is demonstrated using real case data that manufacturing companies can save significant time and cost with our proposed data-driven root cause analysis system; (iv) this study not only aims at improving the quality problem solving practices for a complex manufacturing process but also bridges a gap between the theoretical development of Machining Learning methods and their application in the operations management domain. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Resilience and flexibility in manufacturing and supply chains are widely discussed at times of the present crises situation due to COVID-19 pandemic. It is a question of ongoing debate among practitioners about the role of flexibility and complexity in building resilience for firms and their supply chains. In this research, we examine the flexible business strategies at the demand, supply, and process side of supply chains contributing to resilience. Five of the major flexible business strategies were acknowledged in this research and the single items for constructing them were posited. In this study, we observe the correlations among the constructs based on survey-based research in electronics manufacturing firms, followed by a dimensionality reduction of constructs using factor analysis. The data collected were subject to several initial tests for ensuring validity, reliability, and adequacy using relevant statistical indicators. The measurement model was converted into a structural model and path coefficients were determined. From the path analysis, the latent variables contributing to flexibility in supply chains were found to be independent estimators of resilience. Adding to it, we observe that the single items for measuring the flexibility of supply, process, product, and pricing strategies were evidenced to be strongly correlated. The results are useful to managers for taking decisions related to flexibility implementation, towards enhancing resilience in supply chains. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

Pythagorean fuzzy numbers are used to capture uncertainties associated with decision makers’ ambiguous judgment for the selection of transportation companies in an MCDM context which can also be considered as an important area of supply chain management. In the proposed approach, a new distance measure based on cross-evaluation of Pythagorean fuzzy sets is introduced to overcome the disadvantages of existing distance measures. Unlike existing MCDM approaches, in which either subjective or objective weights of criteria are used, in this method AHP is modified using Pythagorean fuzzy information to calculate subjective weights of criteria, as well as Pythagorean fuzzy entropy weight model is applied to compute objective weights of criteria. Finally, both the weights of criteria are simultaneously taken into consideration to obtain final ranking of the alternatives. To demonstrate the application potentiality of the proposed method, a numerical example is considered with Pythagorean fuzzy input in the context of selecting the best transportation company which is one of the most important parts of transportation management. Further, a comparative analysis is executed with other existing techniques to establish the efficacy of the proposed methodology. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The K-means clustering technique has been utilized to conduct the port classification process at several levels. First, ports have been classified into two general clusters (low capabilities and moderate-to-high capabilities). Then only ports with moderate-to-high potentials were classified and taxonomized. In addition to identifying and classifying ports with moderate-to-high capabilities, findings of the second round demonstrate the existence of three main clusters. The new port classification has been used to provide new insights about the top 50 terminal ports as a real case study.

Transforming the operation of businesses has been possible because of the astonishing speed at which technology has witnessed the change. The automotive industry is on the edge of a revolution. The increased customer expectations, changing ownership, self-driving vehicles, and much more have led to the transformation of automobiles, applications, and services from artificial intelligence, sensors, RFID to big data analysis. Large automobile industries have been emphasizing the collection of data to gain insight into customer’s expectations, preferences, and budgets alongside competitor’s policies. Statistical methods can be applied to historical data, which has been gathered from various authentic sources and can be used to identify the impact of fixed and variable marketing investments and support automakers to come up with a more effective, precise, and efficient approach to target customers. Proper analysis of supply chain data can disclose the weak links in the chain enabling the adoption of timely countermeasures to minimize the adverse effects. To fully gain benefit from analytics, the collaboration of a detailed set of capabilities responsible for intersecting and integrating with multiple functions and teams across the business is required. The effective role played by big data analysis in the automobile industry has also been expanded in the research paper. The research paper discusses the scope and challenges of big data.

	abstract = {New applications of industrial automation request great flexibility in the systems, supported by the increase in the interconnection between its components, allowing access to all the information of the system and its reconfiguration based on the changes that occur during its opera-tions, with the purpose of reaching optimum points of operation. These aspects promote the Smart Factory paradigm, integrating physical and digital systems to create smarts products and processes capable of transforming conventional value chains, forming the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). This flexibility opens a large gap that affects the security of control systems since the new communication links can be used by people to generate attacks that produce risk in these applications. This is a recent problem in the control systems, which originally were centralized and later were implemented as interconnected systems through isolated networks. To protect these systems, strategies that have presented acceptable results in other environments, such as office environments, have been chosen. However, the characteristics of these applications are not the same, and the results achieved are not as expected. This problem has motivated several efforts in order to contribute from different approaches to increase the security of control systems. Based on the above, this work proposes an architecture based on artificial neural networks for detection and isolation of cyber attacks Denial of Service (DoS) and integrity in CPS. Simulation results of two test benches, the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset, and a tanks system, show the effectiveness of the proposal. Regarding the SWaT dataset, the scores obtained from the recall and F1 score metrics was 0.95 and was higher than other reported works, while, in terms of precision and accuracy, it obtained a score of 0.95 which is close to other proposed methods. With respect to the interconnected tank system, scores of 0.96, 0.83, 0.81, and 0.83 were obtained for the accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall metrics, respectively. The high true negatives rate in both cases is noteworthy. In general terms, the proposal has a high effectiveness in detecting and locating the proposed attacks. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {CONTEXT: According to the bifurcation hypothesis, a gap may be growing between “agroecological” organic farms, which rely mostly on ecosystem services, and “conventionalised” ones, which rely more on external inputs, related to contrasting evolutions in farm structure (e.g. size, specialisation) and supply chains. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to 1) analyse the diversity of organic vegetable farming systems in France, 2) investigate the extent to which bifurcation can be observed among organic vegetable farms in France and 3) investigate the extent to which structural factors that can reflect bifurcation (e.g. profiles of “new organic farmers”, marketing channels, farm size) are related to conventionalised or agroecological OF. METHODS: We developed a farm typology based on Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) using information obtained from an online survey with 165 complete answers. We used composite indexes that aggregated primary indicators to compare the biotechnical and socio-economic dimensions of farms among clusters. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The diversity that exists in organic vegetable farms, with large differences among farm clusters, can be interpreted as a snapshot sign of bifurcation, which is a temporal process, and support hypotheses that relate farming structure to farming practices in this perspective. Our study suggests that 1) the dichotomy that contrasts “agroecological” to “conventionalised” organic farms should be considered as a conceptual perspective with two poles and a gradient of farms between them; 2) farms that were created as organic tended to be more agroecological than farms that were converted from conventional farming; 3) new entrants to organic farming had the best agroecological performances; 4) the best agroecological performances were associated with short supply chains, although good agroecological performances did occur with some long supply chains; and 5) the smallest farms were more likely to implement agroecological practices, but farm size did not have the same influence on all agroecological practices. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings confirm the influence of structural factors that reflect bifurcation of the degree of conventionalisation or agroecology of organic vegetable farming. For a given set of structural factors (i.e. farmer profile, farm size and supply chain), however, agroecological performances varied greatly. This suggests levels of freedom to develop more agroecological organic practices for a given farm size or supply chain that should be further investigated. © 2021},

	abstract = {The primary goal of this article is to identify the research fronts on the application of data-driven methods in business and economics. For this purpose, the research literature of the business and economic sciences Subject Categories from the Web of Science is mapped using BibExcel and VOSviewer. Since the assignment to subject categories is done at the journal level and since a journal is often assigned to several subject categories in Web of Science, two mappings are performed: one without considering multiple assignments (broad view) and one considering only those (articles from) journals that have been assigned exclusively to the business and economic sciences subject categories and no others (narrow view). A further aim of this article is therefore to identify differences in the two mappings. Surprisingly, engineering sciences play a major role in the broad mapping, in addition to the economic sciences. In the narrow mapping, however, only the following clusters with a clear business-management focus emerge: (i) Data-driven methods in management in general and data-driven supply chain management in particular, (ii) Data-driven operations research analyses with different business administration/management focuses, (iii) Data-driven methods and processes in economics and finance, and (iv) Data-driven methods in Information Systems. One limitation of the narrow mapping is that many relevant documents are not covered since the journals in which they appear are assigned to multiple subject categories in WoS. The paper comes to the conclusion that the multiple assignments of subject categories in Web of Science may lead to massive changes in the results. Adjacent subject areas—in this specific case the application of data-driven methods in engineering and more mathematically oriented contributions in economics (econometrics) are considered in the broad mapping (not excluding subject categories from neighbouring disciplines) and are even over-represented compared to the core areas of business and economics. If a mapping should only consider the core aspects of particular research fields, it is shown in this use case that the exclusion of Web of Science-subject categories that do not belong to the core areas due to multiple assignments (narrow view), may be a valuable alternative. Finally, it depends on the reader to decide which mapping is more beneficial to them. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the supply chain has become an increasingly pop-ular research topic, but there are little researches on developing countries or emerging market economies as the research object, let alone providing a framework for assessing CSR in sustainable supply chains in the context of these countries. This paper will make up for these literature gaps. From the perspective of the green supply chain management, this paper integrates various authoritative standards and adopts two methods, “R clustering” and “variation coefficient analysis”, to establish a CSR performance evaluation system of China’s transportation industry. Applying the mean square error index weighting method analyzes the performance of 74 companies in China’s transportation industry in 2018 to verify the rationality of the evaluation system. The results find that this industry generally scores low and the performance of responsibilities of different sub‐sectors in this industry is different, but the overall performance trend is improving. This research has impli-cations for China’s transportation industry to improve CSR levels from the perspective of green supply chain management, for managers and stakeholders who are committed to improving China’s CSR green and sustainable development, and for the development of CSR in developing countries and emerging markets. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim (ZBM), a special spice from Chinese different areas, have a widespread variation in quality and price. To avoid the commercial adulteration of ZBM, it is necessary to discriminate them from different areas. As volatile aroma compounds (VAC) have the potential to discriminate ZBM, electronic nose (E-nose) was used to preliminarily discriminate the VAC through sensor response analysis, radar chart analysis, and principal component analysis. Then, Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was utilized to identify VAC through hierarchical cluster analysis and quantitative analysis. Finally, artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to assess the accuracy of the discrimination of ZBM. As a result, we found that ZBM could be successfully discriminated between Chinese Sichuan and the other areas. Our findings would provide guidance for evaluating and predicting the variation of VAC of ZBM from different areas in further study. Practical applications: Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim (ZBM) is a traditional and important spice used in Sichuan cuisine especially hotpot, which are famous all over overseas. However, the ZBM from different producing areas bring various flavors, hampering the quality of Sichuan cuisine developing toward to standardization. Therefore, the authors in this work pursuit an effective way to distinguish the ZBM produced in Sichuan rather than in other province. According to the results of the present study, ZBM could be successfully discriminated between Chinese Sichuan and the other producing areas by using E-nose and GC-MS through artificial neural network. These findings would provide the guidance for evaluating the producing areas of ZBM to be whether or not Sichuan, which could offer the practical help in the purchase of the raw material in the supply chain. Besides, these also can be applied to predict the variation of volatile aroma compounds of the ZBM in the further study. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {Background During food or feed contamination events, it is of utmost importance to ensure their rapid resolution to minimize impact on human health, animal health and finances. The existing Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) is used by the European Commission, national competent authorities of member countries and the European Food Safety Authority to report information on any direct or indirect human health risk arising from food or feed, or serious risks to animal health or the environment in relation to feed. Nevertheless, no methods exist to to collectively evaluate this vast source of supply chain information. Methods To aid in the extraction, evaluation and visualization of the data in RASFF notifications, we present the Rapid Alert Supply Network Extractor (RASNEX) open-source tool available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4322555 freely. Among RASNEX’s functions is the graphical mapping of food and feed supply chain operators implicated in contamination events. RASNEX can be used during ongoing events as a support tool for risk analysis using RASFF notifications as input. Results In a first use case, we showcase the functionality of RASNEX with the RASFF notification on a 2017/2018 contamination event in eggs caused by the illegal use of fipronil. The information in this RASFF notification is used to visualize nine different flows of main and related food products. In a second use case, we combine RASFF notifications from different types of food safety hazards (Salmonella spp., fipronil and others) to obtain wider coverage of the visualized egg supply network compared to the first use case. Actors in the egg supply chain were identified mainly for Italy, Poland and Benelux. Other countries (although involved in the egg supply chain) were underrepresented. Conclusions We hypothesize that biases may be caused by inconsistent RASFF reporting behaviors by its members. These inconsistencies may be counteracted by implementing standardized decision-making tools to harmonize decisions whether to launch a RASFF notification, in turn resulting in a more uniform future coverage across European food and feed supply chains with RASNEX. © 2021 Lorenzen et al.

This division just reflects the different modes of division of labor in the manufacturing value chain of the two major economic regions in the world.

Using a century-long, globally gridded time series that indexes net water availability, every year we compute local occurrences of an extreme "dry"or "wet"condition for a specified duration and return period. A global exposure index is then derived for major mining commodities by weighting extreme event occurrence by local production exposed. We note significant spatial and temporal clustering of exposure at the global level leading to the potential for fat-Tailed risk associated with investment portfolios and supply chains. This may not be a surprise to climate scientists familiar with the space-Time patterns of interannual to decadal climate oscillations that can affect remote regions through teleconnections. However, the traditional approach of climate risk analysis only considers local or point extreme value analysis and hence does not account for temporal and spatial clustering of exposure for global portfolios. As multinational enterprises and supply chains assess and disclose physical climate risks, they need to consider the much higher chance that they may have multiple assets that may be exposed to extreme wet and/or dry climate extremes in the same year. © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In recent years, recommender systems have become necessary in overcoming the challenges related to the incredible growth of information. They are used in a wide range of contexts and applications, mainly as prediction tools for customer interest, designed to help customers decide, compare, discover and explore products (Meyer in Recommender systems in industrial contexts, Sciences et Technologies de l’Information, Grenoble, 2012). Therefore, research in the field has focused on improving the efficiency of data processing for instant and accurate recommendations. Recommendation of products, accordingly, does not take into consideration supply chain constraints for deliveries. This can lead to recommendations for products that can be costly or too long to ship to the customer, resulting in an avoidable increase in the stress on the supply chain. This paper addresses the problem of considering delivery constraints in product recommendations. The objective is to shift demand toward products that can be delivered using the current network state without additional resources in a given time window, perimeter and with a minimum acceptable profit, in the context of e-commerce. To achieve this goal, we propose a methodology to adjust product recommendations in order to shift customers’ interests towards particular products with consideration for remaining unit loads of scheduled deliveries. For this, quasireal-time information about the supply chain is taken into consideration to improve the number of shippable products in the recommendation list, resulting in a possible improvement in truck-load utilization, lower operation costs and reduced lead-times for delivery. This method works in two stages: the first stage is the computation of the recommendation with traditional recommendation systems, and the second stage is recommendation adjustments in four phases that consider the evaluation of active trucks, evaluation of physical constraints for transportation, evaluation of the profits associated with adding a pickup/delivery to a scheduled tour for each recommended item and adjustment of recommendation scores. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of the recommendation adjustment on the recommendation list has been conducted for each of the parameters considered in the proposed method: time window, perimeter radius and minimum acceptable profit. Various experimental results prove that the method permits increasing the number of recommended products that can be shipped using the available resources within a given perimeter radius, time window and minimum profit. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

This study analyzes people’s unfiltered comments and behaviors on social media sites related to the sustainability of fashion products. Recently, the number of social media data, called big data, has exploded, transcending the level that can be analyzed with existing tools. This study aims to identify consumers’ perceptions of sustainable fashion using the search words “sustainable fashion” to examine public opinion trends found in SNS big data. Text mining was employed to extract meaningful words from the SNS texts using semantic network analysis to analyze the connectivity and propagation trends. The text data were collected from Facebook using the Google search engine to detect tendencies in the occurrence of keywords related to sustainable fashion in SNS over the past five years (2016~2020). The results revealed that the keywords “eco-friendly”, “ethical”, and “recycle” had the highest frequency and centrality. As a result of grouping the keywords based on their correlations, sustainable fashion texts from the SNS data could be classified into four groups: “supply chain of sustainable fashion”, “circular fashion”, “fashion business concepts for sustainability”, and “academic importance of sustainable fashion”. This study strengthens the extent of research by using SNS big data and provides guidelines for product development and communication strategies for a sustainable fashion industry based on customers’ meaningful opinions. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to the vast quantities of the water supply networks, the water quality sensors will only be placed on critical nodes, resulting in multiple solutions. However, the increased monitoring data enhances the uniqueness of the solution. Combined with the real-time location of pollution sources, this work proposed a multi-strategy dynamic multi-mode optimization algorithm based on domain knowledge, which could guide the population search and avoid trapped into local optimal. The merging mechanism was used to keep the diversity of the population and prevent sub-population clustering on the same optimal solution. The simulation results showed that the algorithm could effectively solve the real-time location problem of pollution sources in different pipe networks and pollution scenarios. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

However, the impact of the regions' performance on supply chain design decisions remains a relatively under-researched subject in the literature. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for designing a sustainable supply chain that is resilient to random disruptions. We propose a multi-period multi-objective optimization model that utilizes a k-means clustering method to evaluate the regions' sustainability performance. The model aims to determine sourcing and network design decisions as well as resilience strategies. To manage the operational risks associated with the supply chain, we employ a new robustness measure that eliminates the need to estimate the probability distribution of random parameters. Finally, a Benders decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the model. Practical insights are drawn from an actual case study of a downstream petrochemical industry in Iran. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Currently, the social sustainability is a factor that must be considered to design governmental strategies and policies. The objective of this research paper was to show, with a case study an approach to optimize distribution and delivery logistics of food in a social assistance program of school breakfast using mathematical models that include transportation distance, optimal locations, and vehicle routing through different clusters. By using qualitative variables like poverty levels, food insecurity and social exclusion, different clustering methods are proposed with the purpose of identifying the common characteristics in the studied population; and at the same time, reducing the distribution complexity. The results show an efficient approach to design a supply chain that includes economic and social factors. The new model developed in this paper can be used to plan social assistance governmental programs, to identify the specific needs and characteristics of the beneficiaries, minimizing the total cost of the distribution network logistics when delivering food for school meals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Green-ripe pineapples are shipped overseas by sea freight, while those picked at full maturity need to be transported by airfreight over the same large distance. In this study, fresh-cut pineapple cubes were assessed two, five, and eight days after processing from green-ripe pineapples after mimicked sea freigh (SF) and fully ripe air-freighted (AF) pineapples. The sea-freighted samples displayed elevated titratable acidity (TA), thus resulting in smaller ratios of total soluble solids and TA compared to the AF pineapples. Differences in the carotenoid levels of the two fresh-cut categories were found to be insignificant. By contrast, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) calculated on the basis of the volatiles analysed by headspace solid-phase microextraction–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HS-SPME–GC–MS) permitted to distinguish all six individual sample types and to segregate them into two major clusters (SF and AF). The effect of storage on the volatiles was further evaluated by partial least squares (PLS) regression. Substantial chemical markers to differentiate the individual samples and to describe the effect of storage were deduced from the PCA and PLS regression, respectively. In general, fresh-cut products obtained from fully ripe AF fruit displayed higher concentrations of volatiles, in particular, increased concentrations of diverse methyl esters. With progressing storage duration, the concentrations of ethanol and diverse ethyl esters increased. Moreover, products from AF pineapples displayed lower microbial counts compared to those from SF fruit. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Design/methodology/approach: A sample of consumers was surveyed in farmers' markets and social network analysis (SNA) was adopted as a methodological approach to reconstruct the links between the worlds of production and consumption and to derive the relative importance attributed to various factors that promote relational structures. Findings: The work demonstrates the importance of sustainability – as a productive and behavioural model of firms – for the construction of efficient and durable relationship systems in two farmer markets in Sicily. In particular, four fundamental components emerge in the construction of networks represented by consumer sensitivity to sustainability processes, the individual behavioural model of purchasing and consumption, the expectation of political direction and the level and factors of knowledge of the firm. The clustering elements of the relationships were found to be the territory and local products, the environmentalist attitude and the protection of resources, as well as the adoption of a rational waste disposal policy, the fight against food waste, the encouragement of healthier and more sustainable consumption styles, clear and transparent communication and the activation of sustainable supply chain processes in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Originality/value: The paper aims to demonstrate how alternative food systems can become a useful model for large enterprises, which are committed to rebuilding their business strategy to overcome the current crisis. © 2021, Vera Teresa Foti and Giuseppe Timpanaro.},

	abstract = {Food quality and safety issues occurred frequently in recent years, which have attracted more and more attention of social and international organizations. Considering the increased quality risk in the food supply chain, many researchers have applied various information technologies to develop real-time risk identification and traceability systems (RITSs) for preferable food safety guarantee. This paper presents an innovative approach by utilizing the deep-stacking network method for hazardous risk identification, which relies on massive multisource data monitored by the Internet of Things timely in the whole food supply chain. The aim of the proposed method is to help managers and operators in food enterprises to find accurate risk levels of food security in advance and to provide regulatory authorities and consumers with potential rules for better decision-making, thereby maintaining the safety and sustainability of food product supply. The verification experiments show that the proposed method has the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy up to 97.62%, meanwhile achieves the appropriate model parameters only up to 211.26 megabytes. Moreover, the case analysis is implemented to illustrate the outperforming performance of the proposed method in risk level identification. It can effectively enhance the RITS ability for assuring food supply chain security and attaining multiple cooperation between regulators, enterprises, and consumers. © 2021 Jianlei Kong et al.},

	abstract = {Globally, Pakistan ranks 4th in cotton production, 6th as an importer of raw cotton, and 3rd in cotton consumption. Nearly 10% of GDP and 55% of the country’s foreign exchange earnings depend on cotton products. Approximately 1.5 million people in Pakistan are engaged in the cotton value chain. However, several diseases such as Mildew, Leaf Spot, and Soreshine affect cotton production. Manual diagnosis is not a good solution due to several factors such as high cost and unavailability of an expert. Therefore, it is essential to develop an automated technique that can accurately detect and recognize these diseases at their early stages. In this study, a new technique is proposed using deep learning architecture with serially fused features and the best feature selection. The proposed architecture consists of the following steps: (a) a self-collected dataset of cotton diseases is prepared and labeled by an expert; (b) data augmentation is performed on the collected dataset to increase the number of images for better training at the earlier step; (c) a pre-trained deep learning model named ResNet101 is employed and trained through a transfer learning approach; (d) features are computed from the third and fourth last layers and serially combined into one matrix; (e) a genetic algorithm is applied to the combined matrix to select the best points for further recognition. For final recognition, a Cubic SVM approach was utilized and validated on a prepared dataset. On the newly prepared dataset, the highest achieved accuracy was 98.8% using Cubic SVM, which shows the perfection of the proposed framework.. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates billions of self-organized and heterogeneous smart nodes that communicate with each other without human intervention. In recent years, IoT based systems have been used in improving the experience in many applications including healthcare, agriculture, supply chain, education, transportation and traffic monitoring, utility services etc. However, node heterogeneity raised security concern which is one of the most complicated issues on the IoT. Implementing security measures, including encryption, access control, and authentication for the IoT devices are ineffective in achieving security. In this paper, we identified various types of IoT threats and shallow (such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM)) as well as deep machine learning (deep neural network (DNN), deep belief network (DBN), long short-Term memory (LSTM), stacked LSTM, bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)) based intrusion detection systems (IDS) in the IoT environment have been discussed. The performance of these models has been evaluated using five benchmark datasets such as NSL-KDD, IoTDevNet, DS2OS, IoTID20, and IoT Botnet dataset. The various performancemetrics such as Accuracy, Precision,Recall, F1-score were used to evaluate the performance of shallow/deepmachine learning based IDS. It has been found that deep machine learning IDS outperforms shallow machine learning in detecting IoT attacks. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

The four echelon supply chain caters the target of blending 20% bio fuels with conventional fuel during 2018–2026. The mixed integer linear programming model considers handling of multiple types of feed sources, products, transport options while performing the techno, economic and environmental analysis of the supply chain to optimally determine the operational and design decisions. The uncertainty in demand, import product price and biomass feed supply has been tackled using data driven robust optimization approach developed using fuzzy transcription of discontinuous uncertain parameter space using machine learning based unsupervised learning methods. To handle a ∼50% increase in overall biofuel demand over the nine-year planning horizon, the deterministic model shows a dynamically changing supply chain with a ∼20% increase in the newly added locations; however, the worst case robust optimization results are reported to be 6% leaner than the results obtained for the deterministic model. The sensitivity analysis of biomass availability on net present value indicates the need of 43% and above biomass feed supply to run such bio supply chain sector to survive. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Results: Word clouds show the most frequent words in a body of text. Sentiment analysis can be used to calculate polarity scores based on the sentiments that the respondents had in their interviews. Topic models cluster the texts based on dominating topics. Correspondence analysis shows the associations between the words being used and the respective managers. Multidimensional scaling allows researchers to visualize the similarities between the interviews and yields clusters of managers, which can also be used to highlight differences between companies. Conclusions: Textual data science can be applied to mine qualitative data and to extract novel knowledge. This can yield interesting insights that can supplement existing research approaches in logistics and supply chain research. © 2021 by the authors.},

The evolution of topics since 1975 is noted. There is clear indication that journal coverage has evolved. In early years, emphasis was on quantitative modeling methods and relevant methodologies. More recently new research areas to include supply chain management, marketing, service management, and health care are more noted. Some topics are highly correlated. We find that this evolution reflects the changes occurring in business and decision-making environment. The article discusses external and internal factors important in shaping the journal's topical trajectory. Unique challenges in analyzing text data are discussed. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, an unsupervised Bayesian approach for statistical topic modeling, is applied to 1,698 research articles from Decision Sciences over the period from 1975 to 2016.

To obtain primary outcomes, the log-likelihood measure in SPSS Statistics was used. The results can be used to identify the development and implementation of logistics measures in capitals across the EU. In addition to clustering, the statistical analysis evaluates the position of investigated cities concerning traffic congestions, and from an environmental point of view, the carbon dioxide produced from transport. The scrutiny delivers practical outlooks on how clustering can be undertaken and proves how the clusters can be used to plan city logistics and supply chain management.

Because the single-level distribution network structure of production enterprises is not suitable for large-scale logistics distribution, this paper proposes a distribution network structure design that accords with economies of scale and establishes an enterprise supply chain optimization model based on the fuzzy clustering algorithm. Using this optimization method to optimize the inventory of enterprise logistics supply chain, the operation is fast, the result is correct and reasonable, and it can provide good decision support for the distribution network of logistics enterprises.

	abstract = {To promote the progression of information management of agricultural resources in China, the present situation of agricultural management model in China is introduced, and an information agricultural tracking model based on Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed according to the characteristics of production flow of agricultural products. Then, the progression level of agricultural mechanization in China is analyzed based on data mining, and some suggestions are given. The research results show that in the four links of production, processing, transportation, and sales, the agricultural products tracking system in this study can simultaneously deal with more than 800 events per second when conducting information query. When the number of users reaches 20, the response time is 0.021 seconds. When processing messages sent by 100 users simultaneously, the response time is only about 0.12 seconds. When 160 users are sent to the system at the same time, the response time is less than 0.2 seconds. As the number of users sending messages at the same time increases, the response time remains within 0.3 seconds, although delayed. This system can effectively complete the agricultural commodity information tracking, with good performance, query speed, and high accuracy. The agricultural products tracking model in this study is very powerful to complete the information tracking of agricultural commodities, with good performance, fast query speed, and high accuracy. In summary, IoT and data mining are applied to agricultural resource information management, and the analysis and experiment are carried out.

	abstract = {The rapid development of emerging technologies such as machine learning and data mining promotes a lot of smart applications, e.g., Internet of things (IoT). The supply chain management and communication are a key research direction in the IoT environment, while the inventory management (IM) has increasingly become a core part of the whole life cycle management process of the supply chain. However, the current situations of a long supply chain life cycle, complex supply chain management, and frequently changing user demands all lead to a sharp rise in logistics and communication cost. Hence, as the core part of the supply chain, effective and predictable IM becomes particularly important. In this way, this work intends to reduce the cost during the life cycle of the supply chain by optimizing the IM process. Specifically, the IM process is firstly formulated as a mathematical model, in which the objective is to jointly minimize the logistic cost and maximize the profit. On this basis, a deep inventory management (DIM) method is proposed to address this model by using the long short-term memory (LSTM) theory of deep learning (DL). In particular, DIM transforms the time series problem into a supervised learning one and it is trained using the back propagation pattern, such that the training process can be finished efficiently. The experimental results show that the average inventory demand prediction accuracy of DIM exceeds about 80%, which can reduce the inventory cost by about 25% compared with the other state-of-the-art methods and detect the anomaly inventory actions quickly. © 2021 Chuning Deng and Yongji Liu.},

	abstract = {In recent years, blockchain (BC) networks have expanded to a broad spectrum of fields. They have garnered significant attention due to their feature of creating secure private and public networks in a decentralized manner. The traditional FSC fails to meet the customer requirements of quality, safety, reliability, transparency, and traceability. This paper proposes a novel 3-stage methodology using principal component analysis (PCA), total iterative structural modeling (TISM), and Matrice d'Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée à un Classement (MICMAC) analysis to develop an integrated BC with the food supply chain (FSC). The existing literature was surveyed and industry experts' opinion was gathered and various critical success factors (CSF) were identified which are associated with FSC and BC. The data collected from experts were then evaluated for data consistency and dimension reduction through PCA. The dimensionally reduced data set was analyzed by TISM and MICMAC analysis. TISM and MICMAC analysis categorizes the enabler factors according to their hierarchical level and is used to label or distinguish between dependence and driving power. The integrated methodology found nine CSFs, namely, transparent system, fraud detect, inventory management with tracking, scalability, secure system, cost reduction, safe and quality food, customer satisfaction, and government regulations, which are the main drivers for the FSC business. The paper integrates information technology, Blockchain, with operation management, supply chain. The proposed model overcomes the limitation associated with FSC and will motivate the academia and industry to adopt and achieve efficient and effective goals in this field of FSC. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The theory of constraints serves as a lens to identify production and market bottlenecks for the dissemination of electric ve-hicles. The valuable lessons learned from EV1 failure and Better Place bankruptcy paved the way for Tesla’s operations strategy to build gigafactories which bears a resemblance to Ford T mass production last century. Specifically, EV1 relied on external suppliers to develop batteries, while Better Place was dependent on a single manufacturer to build cars uniquely compatible with its charging infrastructure, whereas Tesla established a closed‐loop, green, vertically integrated supply chain consisting of batteries, electric cars and charging infrastructure to meet its customers evolving needs. The analysis unveils several limitations of the Tesla business model which can impede its worldwide expansion, such as utility grid overload and a shortage of raw material, which Tesla strives to address by innovating advanced batteries and further extending its vertically integrated supply chain to the mining industry. The study concludes by sketching fruitful possible avenues for future research. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The willingness to invest in Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) seems not to depend on supply nor demand of technological innovations. The required sensing and communication technologies have already matured and became affordable for most organizations. Businesses on the other hand require more operational data to address the dynamic and stochastic nature of supply chains. So why should we wait for the actual implementation of tracking and monitoring devices within the supply chain itself? This paper provides an objective overview of state-of-the-art IoT developments in today's supply chain and logistics research. The main aim is to find examples of academic literature that explain how organizations can incorporate real-time data of physically operating objects into their decision making. A systematic literature review is conducted to gain insight into the IoT's analytical capabilities, resulting into a list of 79 cross-disciplinary publications. Most researchers integrate the newly developed measuring devices with more traditional ICT infrastructures to either visualize the current way of operating, or to better predict the system's future state. The resulting health/condition monitoring systems seem to benefit production environments in terms of dependability and quality, while logistics operations are becoming more flexible and faster due to the stronger emphasis on prescriptive analytics (e.g., association and clustering). Further research should extend the IoT's perception layer with more context-aware devices to promote autonomous decision making, invest in wireless communication networks to stimulate distributed data processing, bridge the gap in between predictive and prescriptive analytics by enriching the spectrum of pattern recognition models used, and validate the benefits of the monitoring systems developed. © 2020 The Author(s)},

Still, large-scale empirical evidence on this complex association remains elusive, especially at the supply chain level of analysis. We begin to bridge this empirical gap by examining whether supply chain structure systematically associates to supply chain transparency in the context of the collective public environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures made by a focal firm's customers, suppliers, and subsuppliers. To shed light on this underexplored empirical phenomenon, we gather Bloomberg SPLC data and Bloomberg ESG data about 4803 firms and 20,504 contractual ties organized in 187 extended supply chains. We find that supply chain density positively associates with supply chain transparency, whereas supply chain clustering holds a negative association. We also find that supply chain geographical heterogeneity positively associates with supply chain transparency. Our results significantly expand the literature on supply chain transparency and are relevant to supply chain professionals because they emphasize the central role of supply chain structure in enabling or constraining supply chain transparency. © 2021 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.},

	abstract = {A ban on palm oil imports by the European Union has become a problematic issue, especially for palm oil producers’ countries. Oil palm has been widely used in many sub-sectors, and any changes in the production side may affect many sectors that use oil palm as an input factor in their productions. This study explores the chain of the oil palm sector on the other sub-sectors in Malaysia by using a value-added multiplier method and network modeling. The study focuses on the specific oil palm sub-sector and oils and fats sub-sector in the Malaysian economic structure based on the Malaysian Input-Output 2015 Table. Network visualization and all the analyses involving network methods were developed and performed using UCINET and GEPHI software. The value-added multiplier results explained that the net value between output multiplier and import multiplier is vital to depict the real impact of net resources used as an input factor in the oils and fats and oil palm sub-sectors. The high-density value level shows that the Malaysian oil palm sector has high connectivity in the economic system. From the network visualization analysis, the oils and fats sub-sector has a high level of integration with other sectors within the network. Meanwhile, the oil palm sub-sector categorized in the periphery structure group has a low level of integration in the input-output network. This is due to the high value-added demand for oil palm in the oils and fats sub-sector in the manufacturing sector. Overall, most of the sub-sectors in Malaysia are highly interconnected due to the high clustering ratio. Therefore, ensuring sufficient oil palm production is vital for sustainable production of other sub-sectors. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {With the availability of data and the increasing capabilities of data processing tools, many businesses are leveraging historical sales and demand data to implement smart inventory management systems. Demand forecasting is the process of estimating the consumption of products or services for future time periods. It plays an important role in the field of inventory control and Supply Chain, since it enables production and supply planning and therefore can reduce delivery times and optimize Supply Chain decisions. This paper presents an extensive literature review about demand forecasting methods for time-series data. Based on analysis results and findings, a new demand forecasting tool for inventory control is proposed. First, a forecasting pipeline is designed to allow selecting the most accurate demand forecasting method. The validation of the proposed solution is executed on Stock&Buy case study, a growing online retail platform. For this reason, two new methods are proposed: (1) a hybrid method, Comb-TSB, is proposed for intermittent and lumpy demand patterns. CombTSB automatically selects the most accurate model among a set of methods. (2) a clustering-based approach (ClustAvg) is proposed to forecast demand for new products which have very few or no sales history data. The evaluation process showed that the proposed tool achieves good forecasting accuracy by making the most appropriate choice while defining the forecasting method to apply for each product selection. © 2021 CCIS},

One urban planning goal is to prevent environmental hazards, such as those generated by chemical accidents, from reaching human settlements, as they can cause public health issues. However, in many developing countries, due to their strategic positioning in global value chains, the quick and easy access to labor pools, and competitive production costs, urban sprawls have engulfed industrial areas, exposing residential conurbations to environmental hazards. This case study analyzes the spatial configuration of accidental chemical risk scenarios in three major Mexican metropolitan areas: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. Spatial analyses use an areal locations of hazardous atmosphere (ALOHA) dispersion model to represent the spatial effects of high-risk industrial activities in conurbations and the potentially affected populations vulnerable to chemical hazards. Complementary geostatistical correlation analyses use population data, marginalization indexes, and industrial clustering sectors to identify trends that can lead to comprehensive environmental justice approaches. In addition, the marginalization degree of inhabitants evaluates social inequalities concerning chemical risk scenarios. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The literature has focused on the inception and growth of platforms, neglecting how entrants develop and grow disruptive platforms. To address this shortcoming, we study an entrant that was spun off from an established catalog retailer and is steering a multi-sided disruptive platform in the German fashion retail industry. We conduct a longitudinal study on how the entrant leverages the relationships with its multiple platform sides during 2014–2019 by analyzing secondary data using topic modeling and qualitative content analysis. We propose three levers: (1) “guarded inception,” which is the collaboration with a knowledgeable partner unaffected by disruption to quickly overcome the chicken-and-egg problem; (2) “activating force multipliers,” which is the strategic orchestration of complementors being contractually tied to the entrant and working to extend the entrant's value network.

	abstract = {Assessing the relationship between supply chain performance and organizational culture can help to predict scenarios and improve decision-making. However, this relationship is rarely explored due to the complexity of quantitatively addressing its natural subjectivity. Although soft computing techniques would have the potential to overcome this limitation, they have been rarely applied to this context. This paper aims to introduce a decision model to analyze and quantify the causal relationship between organizational culture and supply chain performance based on the combination of fuzzy grey cognitive maps, grey clustering and multiple fuzzy inference systems. Such model is novel in the literature and can provide new theoretical and practical perspectives. The development of this study is based on the SCOR® (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model attributes (SCC, 2017) and Hofstede's (2001) organizational practices, following the quantitative axiomatic prescriptive model-based research. The main contribution is the introduction of a decision-making model that promotes the alignment between organizational culture and supply chain management, internalizing culture as a driver for performance improvement efforts. By conducting two real application cases in companies from different industrial sectors, results show that the model is able to identify crucial elements regarding cultural profile and performance for both organizations, aiding prioritization, anticipation and enabling the development of guidelines for action plans. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Planning for optimized farming with the aim of providing ideal site and cultivar selection is critical for a stable and sustainable supply of rice with sufficient quantity and quality to customers. In this study, a range of morphological characteristics and yield of eight rice cultivars that are commonly cultivated in Korea were investigated from 2005 to 2020. All morphological characteristics were significantly different among the eight rice cultivars. The dataset of morphological characteristics and yield was used to isolate groups of similar rice cultivars. The k-means clustering method was used to group the rice cultivars. Three groups (Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3) were created. Most cultivars were in Group 1. High-yielding rice cultivars were in Group 2, while the rice cultivars in Group 3 had the lowest rice grain yield. After grouping these rice cultivars, ideal farming locations for all three rice cultivar groups were identified to reduce transportation cost using an optimized location–allocation model. Simulation results suggested the following: (1) Group 1 should be produced in Jellanam-do (south west region), (2) Group 2 should be produced in Chungcheongnam-do (central west region), and (3) Group 3 should be mainly produced in the central west region of South Korea. Simulation results showed the potential to reduce transportation cost by around 0.014%. This can also reduce 21.04 tons of CO2 emission from a freight truck. Because these eight cultivars only make up 19.76% of the total rice production in South Korea, the cost reduction proportion was only 0.014% of total revenue. In future studies, more rice cultivars should be investigated to increase the efficiency of the model performance. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Using data of Fujian tea business as an example, customer sources showed a typical clustered pattern overall that could be classified into several hot areas. The distribution of customer sources is dynamic along with time. These hot areas spread from coastal cities to inland cities, ranging from urban to suburban. Meanwhile, it showed a relatively irregular distribution in suburban areas with aggregation distribution near urban areas.

	abstract = {This study aimed to characterise the quality of meat from commercially-raised rabbits. Animals came from five different producers and were slaughtered in three different plants under provincial or federal inspection jurisdiction. Animal behaviour evaluated by scan sampling prior to feed withdrawal (FW) and transport, as well as blood lactate concentration at exsanguination, did not raise concerns with respect to stress. Stomach pH was higher (P=0.047) when the FW time was short (.13.5 h), at a mean value of 2.23. All pH values measured 1 h post-mortem from the Biceps femoris (BF) and almost all (97.6%) from the Longissimus lumborum (LL) were higher than 6. Values for ultimate pH measured 24 h postmortem (pHu) ranged from 5.80 to 6.83 and from 5.70 to 6.70 for BF and LL muscles, respectively. The maximum meat drip loss recorded was 2.6%, while cooking loss reached 30%. Meat lightness (L∗) and colour intensity (C∗) for the long FW times (≥23 h) were no different from those with short and intermediate (15.5 to 17.3 h) FW times. However, these colour parameters were higher for the short FW time class compared to the intermediate FW time class (P<0.02). A hierarchical cluster analysis based on pHu, cooking loss and lightness (L∗) from 200 rabbit loins was performed. Of the four clusters created, clusters 1 and 2 had the best and second-best meat quality, respectively. Clusters 3 and 4 had the lowest meat quality and presented DFD-like (dark, firm and dry) characteristics. Meat did not exhibit PSE-like (pale, soft, exudative) characteristics, even for the slaughter lot with the minimum mean pHu. Of the eight slaughter lots evaluated, more than 50% of the meat from three of them fell into clusters 3 and 4; all three were in the intermediate FW time class. Overall, the quality of rabbit meat analysed was acceptable for commercial use, but rather variable. This suggests that there are factors within the value chain that are not yet fully controlled and require further investigation. © 2021 Universidad Politecnica de Valencia.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The considerations of global sustainability have dramatically increased the importance of the remanufacturing process. Many scholars have started focusing on this vital area from both a management and an engineering point of view. Previous studies have aimed to categorize this area using traditional review approaches, using a smaller body of literature and mostly focusing on the managerial aspects of remanufacturing. Our paper is the only study for which tech-mining and scientometric methods are used to examine remanufacturing research, for the purpose of identifying top actors and key trends with regard to business and technological approaches. We combine both management- and engineering-related studies in this scientometric study. The results shed light on the principal actors, nations, organizations, and scientific domains in this field. Remanufacturing research is categorized using the co-occurrence-based clustering method. This paper identifies four broad research clusters: production planning and control of remanufacturing, material and remanufacturing engineering, supply chain management of remanufacturing process, and remanufacturing applications and new trends. This paper offers benefits to numerous parties: policymakers in the remanufacturing field, academics who wish to see the research domains, and those practitioners interested in the key management, processes, and technologies of remanufacturing activities.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyze structural characteristics and the evolution of “international trade-carbon emissions” network in the equipment manufacturing industry. To do so, we construct four kinds of networks, namely export trade network (E network), export implied carbon emission network (EC network), foreign value-added network (FVA network), and foreign value-added implied carbon emission network (FVAC network) for the said industry. The data obtained from world-input-output table and social network analysis method was used for empirical analysis. The results indicate that (1) the four types of networks show a trend of denseness, which also has the characteristics of trade clustering effect and small-world network. As the equipment manufacturing industry in various countries is increasingly embedded in the global value chain, the value chain is extended globally, which leads to the complexity of the international carbon transfer network. (2) The four types of networks’ pattern are basically stable. Germany plays an important intermediary role. Whereas China is deeply involved in the division of global value chain and has achieved the shift from the edge to the core in all four types of networks, but there is still a big gap compared with Germany. (3) The E network and EC network have the obvious core-edge feature, and the two kinds of networks can be divided into developed countries block represented by Germany, Japan, the USA; developing countries block represented by China and India; and European Union block represented by Spain and France. The developing world receives carbon emission transfer from the developed world. Finally, (4) the division of FVA network and FVAC network segment shows that the global value chain under the current international division of labor is characterized by multi-regionalization. Therefore, actively embedding in the regional value chain has become an important way for China’s equipment manufacturing industry to upgrade to low carbon. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research primarily aims to find and analyse the interaction among success factors for improving the performance of Indonesia’s dairy milk supply chain. Further, this research aims to formulate the right policies for improving the performance of the chain based on the success factor that belongs to cause groups. Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyses 10 success factors for improving the performance of the Indonesian dairy supply chain with the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method and analyses the Delphi method to formulate the right policies for improving performance. Findings: There are four important influencing factors that directly impact the overall system, i.e. the number of dairy cattle import, national milk demand, the total number of dairy farmers and the number of dairy cattle ownership or herd size. Several alternative policies have been designed by several experts according to the influencing factors, i.e. the government assists in the procurement of imported cattle, provides financial assistance to farmers in the form of low-interest financing, improves the partnership system between farmers and dairy cooperatives, provides a reward system for the farmers and increases the level of formality of contract between the farmers and cooperatives. Research limitations/implications: Interrelationships of each success factor and the most important influencing success factors could not be generally determined because it depends on the point of view of the experts. Future research can apply the success factors proposed by this research to the different dairy milk supply chain. Then, this research used only nine experts for formulating alternative policies. Future research may repeat this method using multiple experts to justify the validity of the research. Moreover, this research only explored 21 success factors of the increase in the performance of the Indonesian dairy supply chain. Future research should consider not only the supply side and number of dairy cattle but also several success factors from the causal relationship diagram in the broader dairy milk supply chain. Practical implications: This research provides essential insights for policymakers, as they have to understand and evaluate the success factors before formulating several alternative policies. Social implications: The research has revealed that the right alternative policies can be designed, as the causal factor has been known. Originality/value: This research contributes to applying a combination of causal relationship diagram of System Dynamic and DEMATEL method as a qualitative and quantitative method in one integrated way through performance dairy supply chain analysis. As a result, this research draws a policy for the dairy supply chain referring to the success factor as a cause for the low performance of the Indonesian dairy supply chain. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Glehniae Radix (GR) is one of the major medicinal materials in China. The global demand for GR, especially in Asian countries, is constantly increasing, and the supply of wild medicinal materials falls short of the demand. Previous studies have shown that the production and processing modes of different value chains (VCs) impact the quality of medicinal materials. After 4 years of field and market research, this study includes interviews with stakeholders in the VCs, integrates different types of VCs, and further analyzes the VCs. GR characteristics were also assessed; the length and upper-middle diameter of the collected samples were measured, and the effective components of the samples were determined to rank the GR samples according to their quality. The effective components were further analyzed by the K-means clustering method. Concomitantly, the local price (the sales price of the place where the medicinal materials are produced) and market price (the sale price of medicinal materials in the market) of GR in Chifeng, Inner Mongolia, and Anguo, Hebei, were documented, and the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) method was used to predict the GR price. Ten VCs are summarized in this article. The results showed that the income of the staff at the beginning of the VC is inadequate. Regarding GR origin, Inner Mongolia GR showed higher quality than that of other areas. As a result, the price of medicinal materials is relatively high, which corresponds to the market price of the survey. The forecast results showed that the market price of GR would increase slightly in the future, which could provide reference for the selection of medicinal materials cultivation in the future. Through the study, it was found that the vertical integration in the VCs of GR could guarantee not only the benefit of the growers but also the traceability of the medicinal materials, which further guarantees the quality of the medicinal materials. However, the complex relationship between the cultivation area and the quality of the medicinal materials is not clear, which should be addressed in future research. © Copyright © 2021 Chen, Lei, Bi, Jiang, Guo, Wang and Li.},

	abstract = {Background: Evolution in global supply chain has created numerous complexities especially in the transportation of freight. Some of the complexities include ever increasing operational cost, long lead-times, limited end-to-end visibility and raw material supply disruptions because of adverse weather conditions. To improve processes and keep abreast of competition, it is vital for businesses to leverage their operations on current technologies. Internet of things (IoT) technology is one of the innovative technologies that can bring about radical transformations to freight transportation. Despite the promising capabilities of IoT, research on its application and effect on road freight sector in developing economies is scanty. Objectives: The purpose of this article is to establish the likely effect of IoT on the road freight sector. This article identifies IoT technologies used in road freight and establishes the relationship between the drivers and benefits of implementing IoT technologies. Method: Structured questionnaires were sent to employees working within the road freight industry within South Africa. The data were subjected to factor analysis for dimension reduction. Regression analysis helped to establish the relationship between drivers and benefits of IoT. Results: The benefits of IoT were operational effectiveness and improved decision making. The drivers of implementing IoT were identified as asset visibility and the need for real-time information sharing. The main effect of IoT on road freight sector is increased asset visibility. The challenges impeding implementation of IoT include high cost of installation, skills gap, fear of hacking and cyberattacks. Conclusion: Road freight transport managers are advised that IoT can be a strategic tool that uses smart sensor technologies that provide visibility of assets to reduce operational costs and improve decision making. The article contributes to logistics management literature by enumerating the IoT technologies used in the road freight sector in South Africa. It also highlights that IoT provides end-to-end visibility resulting in improved decision-making for optimal operations. © 2021. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.

	abstract = {The advantages of logistics centers for companies, cities, and countries have been discussed in the literature and generally mathematical model-based evaluations besides multi-criteria approaches are proposed for site selection processes. However, since mathematical modeling of multiple site selection often turns out to be NP-hard problem structure, it is not always possible to obtain an optimal solution by the solvers. For this reason, various meta-heuristic approaches have emerged to solve these complex models. In this context, the aim of this study is to propose an integrated methodology which seeks an optimum result efficiently regarding a logistics center location selection problem. Thus, the optimal clustering of logistics mobility in a metropolitan area was carried out with GIS and a meta-heuristic approach. GIS produced the spatial information needed by p-median model, then the meta-heuristic approach determined the optimal result that considers the logistics costs. BPSO algorithm has employed as the meta-heuristic and it is observed that the algorithm can reach the optimum results within superior times for the problem sizes tested where binary integer programming verified the optimums and the algorithm continued to reach improved solutions where the exact algorithms failed for larger instances. The integrated solution methodology is applied to a large metropolitan region and it is found that it can be used properly by the urban city planners and supply chain managers to analyze critical nodes of transportation networks of megacities. © 2020 World Conference on Transport Research Society},

	abstract = {Globally, the livelihoods of over a billion people are affected by changes to marine eco-systems, both structurally and systematically. Resources and ecosystem services, provided by the marine environment, contribute nutrition, income, and health benefits for communities. One threat to these securities is ciguatera poisoning; worldwide, the most commonly reported non‐bacterial seafood‐related illness. Ciguatera is caused by the consumption of (primarily) finfish contaminated with ciguatoxins, potent neurotoxins produced by benthic single‐cell microalgae. When consumed, ciguatoxins are biotransformed and can bioaccumulate throughout the food‐web via complex path-ways. Ciguatera‐derived food insecurity is particularly extreme for small island‐nations, where fear of intoxication can lead to fishing restrictions by region, species, or size. Exacerbating these com-plexities are anthropogenic or natural changes occurring in global marine habitats, e.g., climate change, greenhouse‐gas induced physical oceanic changes, overfishing, invasive species, and even the international seafood trade. Here we provide an overview of the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century regarding the many facets of ciguatera, including the complex nature of this illness, the biological/environmental factors affecting the causative organisms, their toxins, vectors, detection methods, human‐health oriented responses, and ultimately an outlook towards the future. Ciguatera research efforts face many social and environmental challenges this century. However, several future‐oriented goals are within reach, including digital solutions for seafood supply chains, identifying novel compounds and methods with the potential for advanced diagnostics, treatments, and prediction capabilities. The advances described herein provide confidence that the tools are now available to answer many of the remaining questions surrounding ciguatera and therefore protection measures can become more accurate and routine. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Blockchains have become the prominent technology for logging records within a secured platform. However, the biggest challenge in existing blockchain technologies is unnecessary wastage of resources, such as electricity, due to network traffic and inefficient reward mechanisms during the blockchain mining process. To overcome this, we introduce a lightweight blockchain framework to reduce the cost of computationally intensive mining processes and network traffic while fairly rewarding concurrent miners. The proposed framework divides the traditional blockchain into two layers: master node(s) and slave agents (SAs). We develop mechanisms to (i) compute the reward accuracy of successful miners considering the significant factors of time taken to identify a number used only once (nonce) and their reward success rate history, (ii) ensure the reliability of new transactions with an equivalent proof of work consensus, (iii) handle SAs who identify a nonce value at the same time as other SAs while rewarding successful miners fairly, (iv) analyze the fairness of the reward accuracy model by catering to a successful miner who failed to receive a success reward to compensate for costs spent on the mining process and network traffic, and (v) reduce electricity usage and scalability problems during the integration of the blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) by subdividing the blockchain into separate shards. We find that a lower weight percentage of the time taken to identify a nonce has a more significant effect on reward accuracy than does a higher weight percentage. Further, our results show that the time taken to identify a nonce has a higher dependence on reward accuracy than on the effect of the reward success rate history. We compare our algorithm with the existing algorithms and found the same algorithm complexity O(N) in the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. We determine the break-even point to compensate for the cost of the mining process and network traffic. Consequently, we enable the possibility of compensation for a successful blockchain miner who failed to be granted a reward. This motivates miners to verify and validate new transactions before a new transaction is added to the blockchain. We also adopt an adversary model to obtain the fraction of participating master nodes and SAs that must be compromised by the adversaries to compromise our Master–Slave blockchain (MSB). In this study, we use an electronic healthcare system to illustrate how the proposed MSB works. However, our MSB could be applied in many fields, including the IoT, supply chain management, energy, and commodity transactions. © 2021},

The main contribution of the study is to propose a framework by making ideal matching and ranking of big data solutions to barriers to circularity in dairy supply chains. This framework further offers a specific roadmap as a practical contribution while investigating companies with restricted resources. In this study the main barriers are classified as ‘economic’, ‘environmental’, ‘social and legal’, ‘technological’, ‘supply chain management’ and ‘strategic’ with twenty-seven sub-barriers. Various big data solutions such as machine learning, optimization, data mining, cloud computing, artificial neural network, statistical techniques and social network analysis have been suggested. Big data solutions are matched with circularity focused barriers to show which solutions succeed in overcoming barriers. A hybrid decision framework based on the fuzzy ANP and the fuzzy VIKOR is developed to find the weights of the barriers and to rank the big data driven solutions. The results indicate that among the main barriers, ‘economic’ was of the highest importance, followed by ‘technological’, ‘environmental’, ‘strategic’, ‘supply chain management’ then ‘social and legal barrier’ in dairy supply chains. In order to overcome circularity focused barriers, ‘optimization’ is determined to be the most important big data solution. The other solutions to overcoming proposed challenges are ‘data mining’, ‘machine learning’, ‘statistical techniques’ and ‘artificial neural network’ respectively. The suggested big data solutions will be useful for policy makers and managers to deal with potential barriers in implementing circularity in the context of dairy supply chains. © 2021},

The findings are substantiated through the application of the approach in an omni-channel retail supply chain. The combination of clustering and neural networks improved demand forecast, supporting an assertive identification of demand volume and location. Simulation-based optimization allowed for the definition of which facility would serve identified demands most effectively.

	abstract = {Abstract: The recent adoption of building information modelling (BIM), and the quest to decarbonise our built environment, has impacted several segments of the supply chain, including design and engineering practitioners, prompting the need to redefine the construction personnel positions along with associated skills and competencies. The research informs ways in which practitioners can fully embrace the potential of BIM for energy efficiency to promote sustainable interventions by improving existing training practices and identifying new training requirements as BIM evolves and as practitioners’ ICT (Information and Communications Technology) maturity levels improve. This is achieved by adopting a novel text-mining approach which analyses social media alongside secondary sources of evidence to establish a level of correlation between BIM roles and skills. The use of ontological dependency analysis has helped to understand the degree of correlation of skills with roles as a method to inform training and educational programmes. A key outcome from the research is a semantic web-based mining environment which determines BIM roles and skills, as well as their correlation factor, with an application for energy efficiency. The paper also evidences that (a) construction skills and roles are dynamic in nature and evolve over time, reflecting the digital transformation of the Construction industry, and (b) the importance of socio-organisational aspects in construction skills and related training provision.

	abstract = {In recent years, Industry 4.0 makes a significant impact on the manufacturing industry, which enables the business more intelligent and efficient, all while minimizing costs. As known, the logistics concerns in the supply chain always play an important role to a manufacturing company, and decision on the selection of logistics service provider is a key point, especially for healthcare manufacture whose products are the medical devices or equipment of fragility and high cost. Practically there are so many logistics service providers with varieties in service quality, effectiveness, punctuality and reliability, that the manufacturers often encounter the challenge on the provider selection, and healthcare industry is no exception. However, the research on provider selection for healthcare manufacturers is quite limited. In order to help them to make the decision, this paper designs a logistics service provider selection scheme based on a novel weighted density-based hierarchical cluster analysis with integration of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for healthcare industry. Initially an evaluation index system reflecting the capability of the candidate providers in all aspects is established. To improve the clustering within the scheme, the density concept and the obtained weights are introduced into the traditional hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) to shape a novel Weighted Density-Based HCA (WDBHCA). To validate the feasibility of the scheme, a case study on a specified healthcare industry manufacturer is carried out, and results fulfill the case company's requirement which shows the feasibility of the proposed provider selection scheme. In addition, this scheme can be applied to the provider selection in other fields, as well. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The essence of the transformation processes currently taking place in all sectors of the economy, including industry, is increasingly described by the ecosystem approach. Industrial ecosystems have proven to be the models with the highest production efficiency. The effective management of industrial ecosystems is possible only if the mechanisms underlying their dynamics are understood. Achieving a high level of maturity for industrial ecosystems in the framework of digital technology implementation is of particular relevance, and this research aims to develop and test a methodology for assessing the maturity level of such industrial ecosystems by relying on principal component analysis and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. A mature industrial ecosystem gets rapidly integrated into the new technological paradigm and global value chains, is able to compete in global markets in the long term, and has increased potential for industrialization and digital transformation. The proposed methodology is based on the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) methodology for determining the levels of interests in the area of sustainable development of an industrial ecosystem. The proposed approach singles out a fourth assessment projection in addition to ESG, namely the digital maturity. All four maturity assessment projections are proven to be positively and significantly correlated. An industrial ecosystem maturity assessment scale has been developed, including six levels (very high; advanced; basic; elementary; zero; and minus one). The methodology has been tested on the national industrial ecosystem and the metallurgy and mining industrial ecosystem of Russia. The results show that the maturity level of the Russian industrial ecosystem as of mid-2021 is "basic" with the prospect of transition to "advanced." The Russian metallurgy and mining industrial ecosystem maturity level is “advanced.” The key directions for increasing the maturity levels of Russian industrial ecosystems based on innovations in various industrial aspects are proposed © 2021,International Journal of Technology.All Rights Reserved},

The field is of great significance from economic, food safety and public health points of views. The paper focuses on effective food production, food maintenance energy management and food retail packaging labeling control, using recent advances in machine learning. Appropriate deep neural architectures are adopted and used for this purpose, including Fully Convolutional Networks, Long Short-Term Memories and Recurrent Neural Networks, Auto-Encoders and Attention mechanisms, Latent Variable extraction and clustering, as well as Domain Adaptation. Three experimental studies are presented, illustrating the ability of these AI methodologies to produce state-of-the-art performance in the whole food supply chain. In particular, these concern: (i) predicting plant growth and tomato yield in greenhouses, thus matching food production to market needs and reducing food waste or food unavailability; (ii) optimizing energy consumption across large networks of food retail refrigeration systems, through optimal selection of systems that can be shut-down and through prediction of the respective food de-freezing times, during peaks of power demand load; (iii) optical recognition and verification of food consumption expiry date in automatic inspection of retail packaged food, thus ensuring safety of food and people’s health. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Resource depletion and environmental issues persuade manufacturers to reuse and recycle electronic products. One green strategy in mobile device manufacturing is to refurbish and reuse these products. Consumer feedback in the secondary market impress decision-makers and manufacturer strategies. This research provides a framework that focuses on data mining techniques to investigate consumer attitudes toward refurbished phones by one of the reverse supply chain practices: refurbishment. Furthermore, the consumer's opinions on refurbished mobile phones found on Twitter have been analyzed, and the most appropriate selling strategy has been proposed. Accordingly, the customer's strong motivating factors were identified by assessing approximately 25,000 tweets. The obtained data are analyzed according to three categories: environmental versus financial motivators, refurbished mobile phone features, and main components of refurbished mobile phones. The results indicate that the environmental factor is slightly higher motivating when compared to the financial factor. Other important features were prioritized from the consumer's point of view (highest to lowest): price, product warranty, quality, and seller's reputation. In a separate analysis, camera, display, battery, performance, innovative technologies, and internal memory were found to be the top components of a mobile device that customers pay attention to the most. Interrelationships between identified features were established using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) to accomplish a comprehensive framework. Classification analysis was performed by the matrix of cross-impact multiplications applied to classifications (MICMAC) technique to identify these features based on their driving and dependence power. Camera, screen, battery, internal storage, and performance were significant features that affected customer's attitudes. © 2021},

The originality of the study lies in the assumption that in every business model the generator of added value is the value chain which, if original enough, will maximize potential while minimizing costs. This approach will provide the respective enterprise with a high level competitiveness in the long term. The tested group of enterprises consisted of 354 SMEs, one hundred eighty-seven of which were from the manufacturing and industry sector, with 167 from the services sector. The novelty of this approach also consists of the integrated approach to the business environment in which the value streams were analyzed. The results suggest that the analysis of value streams is suitable for the projection of business models. In addition, the methods of dimensional reduction and logit regression have been identified as appropriate analytical tools, with representative results found valid and utilizable in business practice.

Such complex patterns are the result of a combination of simpler standardized disturbances. However, their detection and identification represent a challenge to current power quality monitoring systems. The detection of disturbances and their identification would allow early and effective decision-making processes towards optimal power grid controls or maintenance and security operations of the grid. In this regard, this paper presents an evaluation of the four main techniques for novelty detection: k-Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian Mixture Models, One-Class Support Vector Machine, and Stacked Autoencoder. A set of synthetic signals have been considered to evaluate the performance and suitability of each technique as an anomaly detector applied to power quality disturbances. A set of statistical features have been considered to characterize the power line. The evaluation of the techniques is carried out throughout different scenarios considering combined and single disturbances. The obtained results show the complementary performance of the considered techniques in front of different scenarios due to their differences in the knowledge modelization. © 2021, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

	abstract = {Recommender system is a computer-based intelligent technique which facilitates the customers to fulfill their purchase requirements. In addition to this, it also helps retailers to manage the supply chain of their business and to develop different business strategies keeping in pace with the current market. Supply chain management (SCM) involves the streamlining of a business’s supply-side activities to remain competitive in the business landscape. Maximizing the customer value is another important activity of SCM to gain an advantage in the market. In this work, the K-Means clustering algorithm has been used for the effective segmentation of customers who have bought apparel items. PCA has been used for dimensionality reduction of different features of products and customers. The main focus of this work is to determine the different possible associations of customers in terms of brand, product, and price from their purchase habits. The result shows that the clusters made by the algorithm based on PCA and K-Means are similar and the results are acceptable on the basis of feedback received from existing customers and satisfies the customers’ requirements based on the amount of money (price range) the customers want to spend while doing online shopping. The features of products purchased by customers were combined together to generate a unique product key for business, and a model was prepared to segment products based on the volume of products sold and revenue generated, and the price of products sold and revenue generated. This work, in the long run, will help business houses to build a sustainable, profitable, and scalable e-commerce business. Environmental, social, and economic aspects are important to make e-commerce more sustainable for the benefit of the society. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Supplier selection and evaluation is a crucial decision-making issue to establish an effective supply chain. Higher-order fuzzy decision-making methods have become powerful tools to support decision-makers in solving their problems effectively by reflecting uncertainty in calculations better than crisp sets in the last 3 decades. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) sets which are the general form of both intuitionistic and Pythagorean fuzzy sets, have been recently introduced to provide decision-makers more freedom of expression than other fuzzy sets. In this paper, we introduce q-ROF TOPSIS and q-ROF ELECTRE as two separate methods and new approaches for group decision making to select the best supplier. As the existing distance measures in q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment have some drawbacks and generate counter-intuitive results, we propose a new distance measure along with its proofs to use in both q-ROF TOPSIS and q-ROF ELECTRE methods. Moreover, a comparison study is conducted to illustrate the superiority of the proposed distance measure. Subsequently, a comprehensive case study is performed with q-ROF TOPSIS and q-ROF ELECTRE methods separately to choose the best supplier for a construction company by rating the importance of criteria and alternatives under q-ROF environment. Finally, a comparison and parameter analysis are performed among the proposed q-ROF TOPSIS and q-ROF ELECTRE methods and existing q-ROF decision-making methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing awareness about Circular Economy (CE) in production and supply chain management, there is little evidence linking CE practices to environmental and economic performances, especially within the traditional wood furniture industry in Indonesia. As with other management practices, implementation of CE can be supported by various factors. Among these factors are the so-called environmental-oriented supply chain cooperation (ESCC) practices. The study reported in this paper has three purposes. First, to investigate how the different levels of ESCC practices will affect the CE practices across the traditional wooden furniture industry in Central Java, Indonesia; second, to investigate the relationship between varying ESCC practices (which is grouped based on the implementation of CE practices) on the CE-targeted performances; and third, to examine the role of ESCC practices as a moderating variable in the relationship between CE practices and CE-targeted performances. This study uses primary data which were collected through closed questionnaires to 190 valid samples of wooden furniture SMEs across the cities of Jepara, Kudus, Rembang, Semarang, Blora and Surakarta. The data were processed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), K-means clustering analysis, Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and regression analysis. The results indicated that, depending on the levels of ESCC practices, the SMEs could be grouped into leaders, followers and laggard, which also determined the extent to which they practised the CE principles. The study also elaborated on the interactions between ESCC and CE practices, and how these might affect the CE-targeted environmental and economic performances. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Findings: A comparison with other models from literature is performed. As a result, the strategy that considered at the same time the excess of zeros and low demands provided the best performance, and thus it can be considered a promising approach, particularly for sustainable supply chains where resources consumption is significant and exist a huge variation in demand over time.

Using the series number of the pipes as category label will result in too many classification categories, and requires many training data to achieve detected accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes novel leakage detection model based on density based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and multiscale fully convolutional networks (MFCN) (DBSCAN-MFCN) to manage the water loss. In order to reduce the number of categories, a large water network is divided into a number of zones by the DBSCAN. The zones are used as the learning labels, which reduces the size of the output matrix of the MFCN. Then the leakage detection model is built based on the proposed method to detect the leakage area. Compared with support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), the accuracy of the proposed method is improved by 78%, 72% and 28%, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed method can solve the problem of leakage area detection, improve leakage detection efficiency and reduce water loss. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

To overcome these challenges, this paper attempts to develop a robust data-driven supply chain model for the efficient procurement of food grains in India. Following the data collected from three leading wheat producing Indian regions, a mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated for minimising total supply chain network costs and determining number and location of procurement centres. The NK Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (NKHGA) is employed to cluster the villages, along with a novel density-based approach to optimise the supply chain network. Sensitivity analysis indicates that policymakers should focus on creating an adequate number of procurement centres in each surplus state, well before the start of the harvesting season. The study is expected to benefit food grain supply chain stakeholders such as farmers, procurement agencies, logistics providers and government bodies in making an informed decision. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In this way, although there are some methods to carry out this practice, none are set up for impulse purchase products. This article illustrates this perspective within the context of an impulse purchase product provisioning problem and shows how group policies based on a clustering process can result in better (lower cost) groupings. To solve this problem, a method is proposed for finding a near-optimal inventory grouping solution. The key innovation in this solution is the idea to form groups for the items that have similar demand or ordering and cost characteristics. Subsequently, once the clusters have been formed, it was necessary to look at aggregating impulse purchase SKUs, and then two grouping techniques or heuristics that both consider common characteristics and develop some ordering decision rules are presented. The results show that the proposed method can be used to cluster impulse purchase products more effectively and the grouping techniques applied were efficient in terms of solution quality. The aim of the proposed unsupervised clustering-based method was not only to provide a classification of SKUs free of subjectivity processes but also to provide an approach to apply more efficient inventory policies for impulse purchase products. © 2021 School of Science, IHU.

	abstract = {Metal artifacts, constituting hoards, were deliberately abandoned for various reasons. In order to study hoards, an interdisciplinary, mainly metallic, database was created as part of the DEPOMETAL research program, and work on elemental compositions of copper-based artifacts was carried out on a national scale. A statistical protocol allowing chronological and geographical clustering of artifacts was developed and combined with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to characterize elemental compositions. For the period between 1350 and 1150 BCE, elemental compositions differ significantly between East and West France. Between 1150 and 950 BCE, there is a strong influence from the Alpine culture up to the mid-western part of France. This observation highlights relationships already observed for previous periods, but never demonstrated for this one. Between 950 and 800 BCE, the difference with the previous period is the revival of the Atlantic networks in mid west France. The study offers a new perspective on supply networks for the end of the Bronze Age in France. The cultural, and therefore identity defining, factors strongly influenced supply networks and also influenced the location of exploited deposits. This conclusion is innovative in the case of the Atlantic coast, which is often still presented as copper-free and dependent on alpine imports. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Given the key role of households in driving global emissions and resource use, a change in their consumption behaviours towards more sustainable levels is essential to reduce worldwide adverse environmental impacts. Thereby, focusing on cities is especially important because of today’s large share of the global population living in cities and because local authorities are close to the needs of their residents. However, devising targeted and effective policy measures implies a thorough understanding of prevailing consumption patterns and associated environmental consequences. The goal of this article is to investigate and compare household behaviours and lifestyle-induced carbon footprints in Sydney and Melbourne in order to enhance today’s understanding of household consumption in cities of a high-income, high-emission country. For this purpose, we employed a two-stage clustering approach with a Self-Organising Map and a subsequent Ward-clustering. This allowed for including expenditure data along with socio-economic attributes and thus for recognising lifestyle-archetypes. These emerging archetypes represent households with similar characteristics and comparable consumption patterns. Analysing the archetypes in detail and performing a city-comparison based on multi-dimensional scaling revealed similarities and dissimilarities between the two metropoles. ‘Older’ archetypes seem to behave more alike across cities but show different carbon footprints emphasising the importance of regionalised environmental assessments and of city-specific supply chains. Distinct patterns especially emerged in the high- and low-income segments highlighting the different importance of different lifestyles in each city. Socio-economically similar family-archetypes were found in both cities, but some of them showed diverging consumption behaviours. This article showed that studying household-induced environmental impacts in cities should not rely on macro-trends but should rather be based on city-specific analyses that capture local peculiarities and consider socio-economic characteristics and consumption data simultaneously. © 2020 The Author(s).

To protect the hardware, the obfuscation methodology hides the original function by adding a large number of redundant states. However, existing hardware obfuscation approaches have hardware overhead and efficiency of obfuscation limitations. This paper proposed a novel methodology for IP security using the minimum spanning tree finite state machine (MST-FSM) obfuscation. In the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm, the Hamming distance defines the cost of obfuscated states. The Kruskal algorithm optimizes the connection relationship of obfuscated states by computing the Hamming distance of the MST-FSM. The proposed MST-FSM is automatically generated and embedded in the hardware IP with the self-building program. Finally, the MST-FSM is applied on the itc99 benchmark circuits and encryption standard IP cores. Compared with other state-of-the-arts, the obfuscation potency is improved by 3.57%, and the average hardware cost is decreased by about 6.01%.  © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Abstract: In traditional Indian agro-fresh food supply chain (AFSC), authors identify the following four shortcomings through the literature survey: (1) unorganized supply chain structure; (2) low profitability of farmers; (3) high wastage of agricultural products; and (4) a large number of small-farm-holding farmers. According to the fourth shortcoming, 85% of farmers have less than 2 hectares of farming land, and these farmers transport their products independently into the market to sell. Owing to this, a higher transportation cost is incurred in traditional AFSC, which leads to low profit for farmers. To overcome these shortcomings, authors propose aggregation of products by forming clusters of farmers and its transportation from these cluster centers to market. This paper formulates multi-period, multi-product, mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to design a four-echelon supply chain with considering the clustering of farmers and perishability of products. A real case study problem of Mandsaur District (India) of vegetable distribution is solved in LINGO 17.0 to check the validity of the formulated model. The results revealed that 85% of the total distribution cost incurred in the transportation of products from farmers to the market. Hence, the major focus should be to design an efficient transportation plan for the minimization of transportation cost from farmers to the market. Further, sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed model is robust and sensitive to changes in maximum distance traveled by a farmer to reach a cluster center and number of hubs to be opened, respectively.

V4 countries are the Czech Republic (CZ), Slovakia (SK), Poland (PL) and Hungary (HUN). No correction factors reflecting road density among major population places were still available for V4 countries. Three-level administrative classification and data from statistical offices concerning population density on 31 December 2017 was used. In MS-Excel was designed functions for obtaining coordinates of selected places and road distances using queries to Web Map Service Google Maps (WMS). Road distances obtained by queries represent the fastest connection on the road. The great-circle distance and spherical triangle were used to calculate direct distances from coordinates. The places were selected using ABC analysis based on the population sample and it was reduced so that the monthly limit of queries to WMS was not exceeded. The obtained values of correction factors can be used in vehicle routing. For the smallest classification items, in CZ, for 273 places with a population of over 5 000, the average values of the correction factor (kavg) range between 1.277 and 1.326.

This article uses a combination of normative analysis and empirical analysis to analyze the status quo of the supply chain of small and medium e-commerce companies. First, this article establishes an evaluation framework for the supply chain of e-commerce companies based on edge computing. Second, according to the distribution of the supply chain, this article adds the member's predetermined quota, reputation, execution time, and other indicators as parameters to establish a fuzzy neural network model. On this basis, combined with the price regression model, the pricing plan is evaluated. The results show that the financing risk obtained by this model differs very little from the actual risk.

	abstract = {Increasing the sustainability of a system can be achieved by evaluating the system, identifying the issues and their root cause and solving them. Performance evaluation translates into key performance indicators (KPIs) with a high impact on increasing overall efficacy and efficiency. As the pool of KPIs has increased over time in the context of evaluating the supply chain management (SCM) system’s performance and assessing, communicating and managing its risks, a mathematical model based on neural networks has been developed. The SCM system has been structured into subsystems with the most relevant KPIs for set subsystems and their most important contributions on the increase in the overall SCM system performance and sustainability. As a result of the performed research based on the interview method, the five most relevant KPIs of each SCM subsystem and the most relevant problems are underlined. The main goal of this paper is to develop a performance evaluation model that links specific problems with the most relevant KPIs for every subsystem of the supply chain management. This paper demonstrates that by using data mining, the relationship between certain problems that appear in the supply chain management of every company and specific KPIs can be identified. The paper concludes with a graphical user interface (GUI) based on neural networks using the multilayer perceptron artificial intelligence algorithm where the most trustworthy KPIs for each selected problem can be predicted. This aspect provides a highly innovative contribution in solving supply chain management problems provided by organizations by allowing them to holistically track, communicate, analyze and improve the SCM system and ensure overall system sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.

The purpose of this article is to use data mining and symmetry-based learning techniques on product data to create a classification model that consists of two subsystems: (1) for predicting the garment category and (2) for predicting the garment sub-category. Classification techniques, such as Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Bayesian Forest were applied to the 'Deep Fashion' open-source database. The data contain three garment categories, 50 garment sub-categories, and 1000 garment attributes. The two subsystems were first trained individually and then integrated using soft classification. It was observed that the performance of the random forest classifier was comparatively better, with an accuracy of 86%, 73%, 82%, and 90%, respectively, for the garment category, and sub-categories of upper body garment, lower body garment, and whole-body garment. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {International authorities are increasingly recognizing that utilizing the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from various industries can assist strategies for mitigating climate change. In developing novel carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies they aspire to contribute to circular economy targets and reduce consumption of fossil-based raw materials. However, the potential economic effects of CCU on industrial value chains remain unclear. Hence, this study investigates the economic expectations placed on those actors currently conducting research and development (R&D) in CCU. The aspired levels of economic performance are identified through a systematic literature review of 19 policy advice reports and 15 scientific papers. Qualitative directed content analysis is conducted, based on an R&D input–output–outcome system. First, we identify three relevant groups of value chain actors by clustering industrial sectors: (a) equipment manufacturers, (b) high-emitting producers, and (c) producers of materials and fuels. Then, we derive a criteria list from the review. Finally, the analysis reveals how CCU innovations are anticipated to impact different industries: Equipment manufacturers could contribute to economic growth. For high-emitting producers, CCU provides one option for “surviving” sustainability transitions. Meanwhile, material and fuel producers need to act as “problem solvers” by offering competitive ways of utilizing CO2. We conclude by identifying research gaps that should be addressed to better understand the economic and social dimensions of CCU and to increase the chances of such innovations contributing to broader sustainability transformations of industrial and energy systems. © 2020 The Authors.

However, the existing methods pay little attention to the analysis of customer requirements data in the beginning of life period. Thus, a data-driven approach for customer requirements discernment is proposed in this paper. It not only manages the vagueness in the semantic expression level using the intuitionistic fuzzy sets, but also adopts the electroencephalogram data as endogenous neural indicators to handle the vagueness in the neurocognitive level. An experimental research integrated with the Kano model is developed to record the EEG data which inherently interpret customers’ psychological states. Benefit from the data mining method, the effect of customer requirements on psychological response can be investigated using the EEG data. Taking the data of initial requirement importance, performance realization levels and customers’ psychological states into consideration, three novel adjusting models are established to acquire the comprehensive importance of each requirement. A case study is conducted to illustrate the feasibility of the approach proposed in this paper. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a transformation in the value chain of different industrial sectors, like the electricity networks, with the appearance of smart grids. Currently, the underlying knowledge in raw data coming from numerous devices can mark a significant competitive advantage for utilities. It is the case of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Such technology gets user consumption characteristics at levels of detail that were previously not possible. In this context, the terms big data and data analytics become relevant, which are tools that allow using large volumes of information and the generation of valuable knowledge from raw data that can support data-driven decisions for operating on the grid. This paper presents the results of the big data implementation and data analytics techniques in a case study with smart metering data from the city of London. Implemented big data and data analytic techniques to show how to understand user consumption patterns on a broader horizon, the relationships with seasonal variables identify behaviors related to specific events and atypical consumptions. This knowledge helps support decision making about improving demand response programs and, in general, the planning and operation of the Smart Grid. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The implementation of Industry 4.0 emphasizes the capability and competitiveness in agriculture application, which is the essential framework of a country’s economy that procures raw materials and resources. Human workers currently employ the traditional assessment method and classification of cocoa beans, which requires a significant amount of time. Advanced agricultural development and procedural operations differ significantly from those of several decades earlier, principally because of technological developments, including sensors, devices, appliances, and information technology. Artificial intelligence, as one of the foremost techniques that revitalized the implementation of Industry 4.0, has extraordinary potential and prospective applications. This study demonstrated a methodology for textural feature analysis on digital images of cocoa beans. The co-occurrence matrix features of the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) were compared with the convolutional neural network (CNN) method for the feature extraction method. In addition, we applied several classifiers for conclusive assessment and classification to obtain an accuracy performance analysis. Our results showed that using the GLCM texture feature extraction can contribute more reliable results than using CNN feature extraction from the final classification. Our method was implemented through on-site preprocessing within a low-performance computational device. It also helped to foster the use of modern Internet of Things (IoT) technologies among farmers and to increase the security of the food supply chain as a whole. © 2020 by the authors.

ABC classification is usually used for inventory items classification because the number of inventory items is so large that it is not computationally feasible to set stock and service control guidelines for each individual item. Moreover, in ABC classification, the inter-relationship between items is not considered. But practically, the sale of one item could affect the sale of other items (cross selling effect). Hence, within time-periods, the inventories should be classified. In this article, a modified approach is proposed considering both time-periods and cross-selling effect to rank inventory items. A numerical example and an empirical study with a data set are used to evaluate the proposed approach. It is illustrated that by using this modified approach, the ranking of items may get affected resulting in higher profit. © 2020 IGI Global.},

Up until now, however, scarce attention has been given to the application of DM techniques in the field of inventory management. Here, we take advantage of descriptive DM to detect and grasp important patterns among several features that coexist in a real-world automotive SC. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to analyse and understand the interrelations between ten quantitative and dependent variables in a multi-item/multi-supplier environment. Afterwards, the principal component scores are characterised via a K-means clustering, allowing us to classify the samples into four clusters and to derive different profiles for the multiple inventory items. This work provides evidence that descriptive DM contributes to find interesting feature-patterns, resulting in the identification of important risk profiles that may effectively leverage inventory management for improved SC performance.

	abstract = {In current supply chain operations, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) procure parts from hundreds of globally distributed suppliers, which are often small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs). The SMEs also obtain parts from many other dispersed suppliers, some of whom act as sole sources of critical parts, leading to the creation of complex supply chain networks. These characteristics necessitate having a high degree of visibility into the flow of parts through the networks to facilitate decision making for OEMs and SMEs, alike. However, such visibility is typically restricted in real-world operations due to limited information exchange among the buyers and suppliers. Therefore, we need an alternate mechanism to acquire this kind of visibility, particularly for critical prediction problems, such as purchase orders deliveries and sales orders fulfillments, together referred as work orders completion times. In this paper, we present one such surrogate mechanism in the form of supervised learning, where ensembles of decision trees are trained on historical transactional data. Furthermore, since many of the predictors are categorical variables, we apply a dimension reduction method to identify the most influential category levels. Results on real-world supply chain data show effective performance with substantially lower prediction errors than the original completion time estimates. In addition, we develop a web-based visibility tool to facilitate the real-time use of the prediction models. We also conduct a structured usability test to customize the tool interface. The testing results provide multiple helpful suggestions on enhancing the ease-of-use of the tool.  © 2020 by ASME.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted data mining analysis on the archival data of China's FSPs in the mobile production industry from 2015 to 2018, using neural networks in the first stage and multiple regression in the second stage. Findings: The findings suggest that digital platforms sponsored by FSPs have a discriminative effect based on implicit BDA on identifying the quality and potential risks of borrowers. The results also show that tailored information utilised by FSPs has a supportive effect based on explicit BDA in helping SMEs obtain financing. Originality/value: This study contributes to the emergent research on BDA in supply chain management by extending the contextual research on information signalling and platform theory in SCF. Furthermore, it examines the distinctive financing decision models of FSPs and provides a solution that addresses the information deficiency and overload of both lenders and borrowers and plays a certain reference role in alleviating the financing problems of SMEs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Academic/practical relevance: The supply chain is subject to the classic hold-up problem-as the lack of a contract commitment hinders suppliers' incentives to make investment upfront-complicated with supplier competition. Methodology: With deterministic costreduction outcomes, suppliers will not exert any effort if this effort is observable, and a pure-strategy equilibrium does not exist if the effort is unobservable. We analyze the mixed-strategy equilibrium with unobservable supplier effort, in which suppliers randomize their efforts and the buyer designs an optimal procurement mechanism. Results: We show that the optimal procurement mechanism can be implemented by a conventional single-price reverse auction with a random reserve price. The mixed strategy of supplier effort generates endogenous information asymmetry on supplier costs that provides suppliers with information rent, which sustains their efforts. The endogenous information asymmetry improves effort efficiency (by inducing positive supplier effort), yet introduces trade inefficiency (by causing the possible failure of trade between the parties). Although increasing supplier competition (measured by the number of suppliers) hurts the effort efficiency, it improves trade efficiency. As a result, the buyer is always better off introducing supplier competition by including more than one supplier in the supply base. However, the desired supply base size (number of suppliers) depends on the product revenue: For high-margin goods, the optimal size is achieved with two suppliers, whereas for low-margin goods, a larger supply base is better for the buyer. We show that the result based on deterministic cost reduction can be established as a limit of the case when uncertainty in cost reduction exists and shrinks to null. Managerial implications: Our study helps to understand the impact of supplier competition when supplychain parties deliberately make their actions unpredictable to avoid being held up. The findings provide managerial guidance on procurement auction and supply base designs.  © 2019 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {Radix Astragali (RA), the root of Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus (Bunge) P.K. Hsiao, known as “Huangqi” in Chinese, has been used as a traditional herbal medicine or food in China for more than 2,000 years and is now consumed globally. Unfortunately, the increasing demand for RA has led to the overexploitation of its wild stock, as well as quality problems, including adulteration and contamination. Therefore, the sustainable cultivation of RA is urgently needed. In the present research, semi-structured interviews and key informant interviews were conducted, over a 2-year period, to collect data from stakeholders in the main production areas; moreover, a targeted chemical analysis-based quality assessment strategy was applied to understand the quality of RA. Accordingly, 10 different types of value chains (VCs) were identified in RA production; meanwhile, the contents of the main active ingredients (astragaloside and calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside) were analyzed by HPLC-ELSD-UV and the yield of medicinal material was demined and further analyzed using k-means clustering analysis. The results show that the tight relationship between quality of the RA and stakeholders’ revenues among the VCs, which reflects a more general trend in the production system. Over the past few decades, vertical coordination has emerged increasingly in VCs of RA, which leads to a more coherent traceability system and rigorous regulations in the supply chains. Daodi herbs can be considered to be a standard that is distinctive with good quality characteristics that emphasize the origins of the medicinal plants. We find that the suitability of geographical areas and vertical integration can improve the VCs of RA, which further contributes to its quality control, as well as its sustainable production. © Copyright © 2020 Bi, Bao, Zhang, Yao and Li.},

	abstract = {Under the backdrop of the continuous escalation of the Sino-US. trade friction, research on the coping strategies of the Chinese manufacturing industry has become the focus of attention for industry and academia. The characteristics of global value chains (GVCs) are of utmost importance to the formulation of industrial strategies. However, comparatively little attention has been paid to this topic in existing studies. Following the production activity decomposition framework and combining with the 2016 Release of the World Input-Output Tables, the characteristics of GVCs between China and the U.S. from the three aspects of the degree of participation, GVC status, and value-added linkage were compared, the relationship between the degree of external dependence and the degree of participation, the input of independent innovation and GVC status, the outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) and value-added linkage were empirically analyzed, the corresponding strategies were put forward. Results show that: The degree of backward participation of the Chinese manufacturing industry is significantly stronger than the degree of forward participation, whereas the degree offorward and backward participation of the U.S. manufacturing industry is comparatively balanced. The Chinese manufacturing industry can improve the structural imbalance of participation in GVCs by reducing the industry’s degree of external dependence. The embedding position of the Chinese manufacturing industry is increasing rapidly, including the continued weakening of the industrial value-added, whereas the U.S. manufacturing industry has a significant rising trend toward the high end in GVCs. The Chinese manufacturing industry can increase the input of independent innovation to reverse the trend of “marginalization” of the GVC status. The value-added output linkage of the Chinese manufacturing industry is highly concentrated, whereas the input linkage is diversified and dispersed. Moreover, the characteristics of the value-added linkage clustering of the U.S. manufacturing industry are significant. The Chinese manufacturing industry can optimize the allocation scheme for the value-added linkage by transferring OFDI. This study is important for China to select the industrial strategies. © Vilnius University, 2002-2020.},

Similar to the concept of key sectors, a network analysis of key regions and key region-sectors of the EU in the global value chains (GVC) is carried out, taking into account both direct and indirect linkages. Additionally, a clustering analysis is performed to indicate the existence of highly interconnected groups of regions and the polarized structure of the European value chain network. The analysis is extended to quantify implications of Brexit, showing the relative vulnerability of the most internationalized regions and the differentiated sectoral impact according to the geographical origin, as London would mostly affect (tourism and financial) services, whereas the rest of the UK regions would mainly affect manufacturing activities. The findings suggest the considerable heterogeneity of European value chains as a result of varying levels of urban hierarchy, trade specialization between and within countries as well as sectoral concentration of regional economies. The empirical findings can provide valuable policy insights for supporting coordinated economic strategies to enhance regional competitiveness, development and cohesion, and reduce trade imbalances and spatial inequalities in the EU. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Non-destructive mechanisms for fruit grading and sorting have received wide research attention in the drive towards sustainable agricultural practices minimizing energy utilization, computational resources and improving the longevity of the produce. Green engineering practices imbibing artificial intelligence and image processing approaches have considerably improved the potential of agricultural supply chain of several products. Automated sorting and grading of tomatoes according to ripeness levels and defects, to improve their utilization and commercial value is a complex problem, due to the large number of discerning parameters involved. In this paper, we propose a classification system employing a pair of binary SVM classifiers for sorting and grading tomatoes. The first SVM classifier is unique irrespective of the ripeness levels, to separate tomato species. The ripeness level is determined for tomato species based on the mean green component. Followed by this, the defective and healthy tomatoes are distinguished with a super pixel segmentation operation. The second SVM classifier is then employed to detect the black spot and canker defects separately in ripe and unripe fruits. Though the same feature vectors are employed for defect detection irrespective of the ripeness, the reference image taken for generation of residual images for feature extraction differs for ripe and unripe tomatoes. Extensive experiments with well-designed test cases on datasets created under controlled experiments demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed system. We have accomplished a classification accuracy of 95% for ripe fruits and 92.5% for unripe fruits in the detection of black spots and cankers. © 2020 Alpha Publishers. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to discern emerging trends and provide a longitudinal perspective on merchandising research by identifying relationships between merchandising-related subdomains/themes. Design/methodology/approach: This study sourced 657 merchandising-related articles published since 1960, from the Scopus database and 425 from Web of Science. After processing and normalizing the data, this study performed co-word and thematic network analyses. Taking a text mining approach, this study used topic modeling to identify a set of coherent topics characterized by the keywords of the articles. Findings: This study identified the following merchandising-related themes: branding, retail, consumer, behavior, modeling, textile and clothing industry and visual merchandising. Although visual merchandising was the first type of merchandising to be used in-store, only recently has it become an emerging topic in the academic literature. There has been a further trend over the past decade to understand the adoption of simulation technology, such as computer-aided design, particularly in supply chain management in the clothing industry. These and other findings contribute to the discussion of the merchandising concept, approached from an evolutionary perspective. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions of this study hold implications at the intersection of merchandising, sectors, new technologies, research methodologies and merchandising-practitioner education. Research trends suggest that, in the future, virtual reality and augmented reality using neuroscientific methods will be applied to the e-merchandising context. Practical implications: The different dimensions of merchandising can be used to leverage store managers’ decision-making process toward an integrated store-management strategy. In particular, by adopting loyalty merchandising tactics, the store can generate emotional attachment among consumers, who will perceive its value and services as unique, thanks to merchandising items designed specifically with that aim in mind. The stimulation of unplanned purchases, the strategic location of products and duration of each merchandising activity in the store, the digitalization of merchandising and the application of findings from neuroscience studies are some of the most relevant practical applications. Originality/value: This study provides the first-ever longitudinal review of the state of the art in merchandising research, taking a holistic perspective of this field of knowledge spanning a 60-year period. The work makes a valuable contribution to the development of the marketing discipline. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The current wave of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is reshaping the manufacturing sector with system interoperability, remote real-time process monitoring and advanced analytics. As digitally enabled manufacturing machines continue to grow exponentially, it becomes imperative to uniquely and securely identify them in the cyber-physical world, particularly in defense, biomedical, energy and aerospace manufacturing. Research about threats originating from internal adversaries’ i.e the machine/organization owner within a tiered digitally connected supply chain is scarce. This paper introduces a machine fingerprinting scheme named as the ‘Witness Box Protocol’ (WBP) that exploits the physical properties of manufacturing machines (legacy or smart) and their surroundings to create a unique biometric like fingerprint. WBP provides both machine registration and authentication on a digital network through a low cost, non-invasive approach. The fingerprint is generated by a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique that accommodates small variations in physical signature data and can corroborate data provenance from machines by verifying machine identity through authentication. Additionally, this fingerprint hash simplifies asset management within a large enterprise or distributed network comprising of thousands of machines in a Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm. In this research, fingerprints were randomly generated from the statistical features of signals from 3D printers and CNC machine in a production-like lab environment. Using k-means clustering and Jaccard similarity index, these fingerprints are shown to identify the source equipment with 95 % accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The new era of circular supply chain management (CSCM) produces a new complex decision area for process managers. Part of it can be attributed to green procurement, in which a large number of potential ideas need to be reviewed that can sustain business. Such a large amount of data can quickly lead to information overload, especially without the presence of appropriate decision support tools. While there exists a range of visualisation methods that can aid the exploration of recommendations, there is a lack of studies that illustrate how these exploration techniques can facilitate the identification of CSCM activities. This paper showcases a study on how to ease the identification of new sustainable business opportunities through visual data exploration. Following the design science methodology, we have designed and evaluated a recommender system prototype (the IS Identification App) that supports sector-based identification of industrial symbiosis. The interactive visualisation enhances users with more control over recommendations and makes the recommendation process more transparent. Our case study results indicate that the interactive visualisation technique is a viable, fast and effective approach for exploring recommendations that increase the sustainability of the supply chain. © 2020 The Author(s)},

With the advent of Big Data, operations have become increasingly more data-driven, facing new challenges related to volume, variety, and velocity, and giving birth to another type of value chain called Big Data Value Chain (BDVC). Organizations have become increasingly interested in this kind of value chain to extract confined knowledge and monetize their data assets efficiently. However, few contributions to this field have addressed the BDVC in a synoptic way by considering Big Data monetization. This paper aims to provide an exhaustive and expanded BDVC framework. This end-to-end framework allows us to handle Big Data monetization to make organizations’ processes entirely data-driven, support decision-making, and facilitate value co-creation. For this, we present a comprehensive review of existing BDVC models relying on some definitions and theoretical foundations of data monetization. Next, we expose research carried out on data monetization strategies and business models. Then, we offer a global and generic BDVC framework that supports most of the required phases to achieve data valorization. Furthermore, we present both a reduced and full monetization model to support many co-creation contexts along the BDVC. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The paper discusses an approach for detecting cyber attacks against smart power supply networks, based on identifying anomalies in network traffic by assessing its self-similarity property. Methods for identifying long-term dependence in fractal Brownian motion and real network traffic of smart grid systems are considered. It is shown that the traffic of a telecommunication network is a self-similar structure, and its behavior is close to fractal Brownian motion. Fractal analysis and mathematical statistics are used as tools in the development of this approach. The issues of a software implementation of the proposed approach and the formation of a dataset containing network packets of smart grid systems are considered. The experimental results obtained using the generated dataset have demonstrated the existence of self-similarity in the network traffic of smart grid systems and confirmed the fair efficiency of the proposed approach. The proposed approach can be used to quickly detect the presence of anomalies in the traffic with the aim of further using other methods of cyber attack detection. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background Despite progress made over the past twenty years, child mortality remains high, with 5.3 million children under five years having died in 2018 globally. Pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria remain among the commonest causes of under-five mortality; contributing 15%, 8%, and 5% of global mortality respectively. Recent evidence shows that integrated community case management (iCCM) of pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria can reduce under-five mortality. However, despite growing evidence of the effectiveness of iCCM, there are implementation challenges, especially stock out of iCCM commodities and inadequate supportive supervision of community health workers (CHWs). This study aimed to address these two key challenges to successful iCCM implementation by using mobile health (mHealth) technology. Methods This cluster randomised controlled trial compared health centre catchment areas (clusters) where CHWs and their supervisors implemented mHealth-enhanced iCCM supportive supervision and supply chain management vs clusters implementing iCCM as per current Zambian guidelines. CHWs in intervention clusters used community DHIS2 platform on mobile phones to report on a weekly basis children with iCCM conditions and make requisitions for iCCM commodities. Their supervisors received electronic reports on disease caseloads and monthly automated supervision reminders. The supervisors on receipt of requisitions, organized the medical supplies and notified CHWs for collection. Intention-to-treat analysis on the primary outcome, the percentage of children aged 2-59 months receiving appropriate treatment for malaria, pneumonia, or diarrhoea from an iCCM trained CHW, was performed using a generalized linear model. Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals comparing the prevalence of appropriate treatment in the intervention and control groups were calculated using log binomial regression with an exchangeable correlation matrix, adjusted for clustering by health facility. Results In the intervention clusters, 61.3% (98/160) of expected monthly supervision visits took place vs 52.0% (78/150) in the controls. A total of 3690 children 2-59 months old presented with malaria, diarrhoea, or pneumonia. In the intervention group, 65.9% (1,252/1,899) of children received appropriate care for iCCM conditions, compared to 63.3% (1,134/1,791) in the control group. The mHealth intervention was associated with 18.0% improvement in supportive supervision and 21.0% increase in appropriate treatment for pneumonia; these changes were not statistically significant. There was a 2-3-fold increase in the proportion of CHWs receiving supplies ordered: prevalence ratios ranged from 2.82 (confidence interval (CI) = 1.50, 5.30) to 3.01 (95% CI = 1.29, 7.00) depending on the particular commodity. Conclusion This study was unable to determine whether using mHealth technology would strengthen supervision and supply chain management of iCCM commodities for community-level workers. There was no statistically significant effect of mHealth enhanced iCCM on appropriate diagnosis and treatment for children with malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhoea in rural Zambia. Longer term longitudinal studies are required to determine the impact of mHealth enhanced iCCM on health outputs and outcomes. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Carbon emissions embodied in interprovincial trade (CEE-IT) are closely related with the environmental responsibility allocation. Besides the perspective of administrative division, more rational and effective clusters based on provincial characteristics is more conducive for understanding the regional emission reduction linkages and simplifying the steps of responsibility determination. To provide a reasonable management of CEs transference mitigation in China, this study develops a provincial clustering scale CEE-IT model through three-scale accountings (i.e., aggregated-scale, consumption-scale and income-scale analysis). Specifically, 30 provinces are aggregated into several new regions with similar characteristics. Carbon emissions from different energy sources are first considered to distinguish and specify different emission reduction modes. The input output analysis (IOA) and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) are applied to quantify the embodied interprovincial carbon emissions and the relative contributions of socio-economic factors at the sector-level of disaggregation and aggregation, respectively. Three-scale accountings are innovatively employed into EEBT model to deeply analyze the emissions along China's domestic inter-regional supply chains for identifying regional production, consumption and income-based emission responsibilities. Based on three accounting perspectives, the results provide suggestions for coordinated emission reduction across regions (including specific provinces) from the overall and decomposition levels. It shows that cutting the imports of mining sector for all regions could reduce emissions from the supply side. Rural household consumption and fixed capital formation are the major drivers for Ⅳ region from the consumption side. Technological innovations in Ⅲ region have reduced carbon emissions by 55.2% and contributed 159 Mt reductions from 2007 to 2012. Ⅲ region is insensitive to energy types and the utilization of crude oil in Ⅰ region limit the improvement of its system efficiency. Importing large quantities of emission-intensive products from Beijing and Jiangsu is a cause of high income-based emissions in Ⅱ region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

However, solving the CCCP is a challenging task due to its computational complexity. In this work, a strategy based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and dispersion reduction is presented to obtain the most likely locations of facilities for sets of client points considering their distribution patterns. Experiments performed on large CCCP instances, and considering updated best-known solutions, led to estimate the performance of the GMMs approach, termed as Dispersion Reduction GMMs, with a mean error gap smaller than 2.6%.

	abstract = {This article argues that technical leaders in a post-COVID-19 world should adopt stakeholder-oriented management techniques tailored to complex, chaotic, and disordered domains. In part, this is because the unprecedented breadth of the novel coronavirus's impact has required organizations to strengthen their stakeholder orientation, given the second-order, network effects of management decisions during a global pandemic on unseen, unknown constituencies. In part, this is because even our causal models and modes of group sense-making have been affected by the suffering and uncertainty caused by the pandemic. This article draws from ongoing research on complex stakeholder networks, applying recent advances in graph theory to establish that organizations with more resilient, more efficient, more globally connected stakeholder networks better satisfy the claims of their stakeholders, across an array of financial and environmental, social and governance metrics. This research can be extended into postcrisis, chaotic, and disordered domains by adapting the Cynefin framework, from the Welsh word for 'habitat,' and applying it to the stakeholder theory literature. This stakeholder network perspective yields surprisingly simple and relevant tools for managers, as shown by a case study of the real-world performance of large US firms during the period of COVID-19's initial diffusion and impact.  © 1973-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To preserve the quality of fresh pear fruit after harvest and deliver quality fruit year-round a controlled supply chain and long-term storage are applied. During storage, however, internal disorders can develop due to suboptimal storage conditions that may not cause externally visible symptoms. This makes them impossible to be detected by current commercial quality grading systems in a reliable and non-destructive way. A combination of a Support Vector Machine coupled with a feature extraction algorithm and X-ray Computed Tomography is proposed to successfully detect internal disorders in ‘Conference’ and ‘Cepuna’ pear fruit nondestructively. Classifiers were able to distinguish defective from sound fruit with classification accuracies ranging between 90.2 and 95.1% depending on the cultivar and number of used features. Moreover, low false positive and negative rates were obtained, respectively ranging between 0.0 and 6.7%, and 5.7 and 13.3%. Classifiers trained on ‘Conference’ data were transferred effectively to the ‘Cepuna’ cultivar, suggesting generalizability to other cultivars as well. With continuing developments in both hardware and software to increase inspection speed and reduce equipment costs, the method can be implemented in industrial applications, e.g., inline translational X-ray CT. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The authenticity of tea has become more important to the industry while the supply chains become complex. The quality and price of tea produced in different regions varies greatly. Currently, a rapid analytical method for testing the geographical origin of tea is missing. XRF is emerging as a screening technique for mineral and elemental analysis with applications in the traceability of foodstuffs, including tea. This study aims to develop a reliable multivariate classification model using XRF spectroscopy to obtain the mineral content. A total of 75 tea samples from tea producing countries throughout the world were analysed. After variable shortlisting, 18 elements were used to construct the multivariate models. Tea origin was determined by classifying the tea into 5 major geographical regions producing most of the global tea. PCA showed initial clustering in some regions, although the types of teas included in the study (black, green, white, herbal) showed no discrete cluster membership. The prediction power of each classification model developed was determined by using two multivariate classifiers, SIMCA and PLS-DA, against an independent validation set. The average overall correct classification rates of PLS-DA models were between 54-85% while the results of SIMCA models were between 70-84% resolving the poor clustering initially shown by PCA. This study demonstrated the potential of geographical origin of tea prediction using elemental contents of tea. Naturally, the classification can be linked not only to origin but to the type of tea as well. Practical application: Wholesalers and retailers need a rapid and robust screening tool to confirm the origin and type of tea they sell to consumers. X-Ray fluorescence spectroscopy proved a good technique for achieving this in commercial teas sourced worldwide. Building on multivariate models, broad classification was accomplished both in terms of origin (Asian vs non-Asian) and in tea type with zero sample preparation and low cost of analysis. © 2021 The Author(s)},

Since the introduction of the method for DCA by Small (J Am Soc Inf Sci 24(4):265–269, 1973) a variety of modifications towards optimising its results have been proposed by several researchers. We recommend a new approach to improve the results of DCA by integrating the concept of the document similarity measure into it. Our proposed method modifies DCA by incorporating the semantic similarity using latent semantic analysis for the abstracts of the top-cited documents. The interaction of these two measures results in a new measure that we call as the semantic similarity adjusted co-citation index. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through an empirical study of the tourism supply chain (TSC), where we employ the techniques of the network and cluster analyses. The study also comprehensively explores the resulting knowledge structures from both the methods. The results of our case study suggest that the clustering quality and knowledge map of the domain can be improved by considering the document similarity along with their co-citation strength. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {For a slow-moving high-margin product, we demonstrate the viability of an information-based nudging strategy. The motivation to study this problem was because a firm faced availability constraints for one of its slow-moving high-margin products, but the available quantities still exceeded the current demand. To identify customers to nudge, we develop a support vector machine (SVM) approach to rank order the customers based on their propensity to purchase the product. The underlying notion in our approach is that Type I errors, to be defined in the paper, in our classifier are not necessarily problematic but are potential nudging targets. Also, as a consequence, traditional ways of evaluating classifiers (with Type I and Type II errors) are not appropriate. Therefore, we conduct a field experiment to evaluate how well the identified customers are nudged through information and/or couponing. We find that in terms of the successful nudges, our SVM-based approach performed better than other approaches. The experiment also generated insights about when couponing as opposed to information is more effective when nudging. © 2020 Production and Operations Management Society},

	abstract = {The utilization of the black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens L. for recycling organic waste into high-quality protein and fat biomass for animal feeds has gained momentum worldwide. However, information on the genetic diversity and environmental implications on safety of the larvae is limited. This study delineates genetic variability and unravels gut microbiome complex of wild-collected and domesticated BSF populations from six continents using mitochondrial COI gene and 16S metagenomics. All sequences generated from the study linked to H. illucens accessions KM967419.1, FJ794355.1, FJ794361.1, FJ794367.1, KC192965.1, and KY817115.1 from GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences generated from the study and rooted by GenBank accessions of Hermetia albitarsis Fabricius and Hermetia sexmaculata Macquart separated all samples into three branches, with H. illucens and H. sexmaculata being closely related. Genetic distances between H. illucens samples from the study and GenBank accessions of H. illucens ranged between 0.0091 and 0.0407 while H. sexmaculata and H. albitarsis samples clearly separated from all H. illucens by distances of 0.1745 and 0.1903, respectively. Genetic distance matrix was used to generate a principal coordinate plot that further confirmed the phylogenetic clustering. Haplotype network map demonstrated that Australia, United States 1 (Rhode Island), United States 2 (Colorado), Kenya, and China shared a haplotype, while Uganda shared a haplotype with GenBank accession KC192965 BSF from United States. All other samples analyzed had individual haplotypes. Out of 481,695 reads analyzed from 16S metagenomics, four bacterial families (Enterobactereaceae, Dysgonomonadaceae, Wohlfahrtiimonadaceae, and Enterococcaceae) were most abundant in the BSF samples. Alpha-diversity, as assessed by Shannon index, showed that the Kenyan and Thailand populations had the highest and lowest microbe diversity, respectively; while microbial diversity assessed through Bray Curtis distance showed United States 3 (Maysville) and Netherlands populations to be the most dissimilar. Our findings on genetic diversity revealed slight phylogeographic variation between BSF populations across the globe. The 16S data depicted larval gut bacterial families with economically important genera that might pose health risks to both animals and humans. This study recommends pre-treatment of feedstocks and postharvest measures of the harvested BSF larvae to minimize risk of pathogen contamination along the insect-based feed value chain. © Copyright © 2020 Khamis, Ombura, Akutse, Subramanian, Mohamed, Fiaboe, Saijuntha, Van Loon, Dicke, Dubois, Ekesi and Tanga.},

	abstract = {Although hydrogen is identified to be the first choice of the energy industry in the future society, the severe shortage of hydrogen infrastructure hinders the development of the hydrogen economy. Therefore, by simultaneously integrating the planning and operation issues of a hydrogen supply chain network (HSCN) and taking the hydrogen demand of hydrogen fuel vehicles into account, this paper proposes a general optimization design model for a HSCN based on the off-grid wind-hydrogen coupling system to realize the scientific layout of hydrogen infrastructure and stimulate the transition of hydrogen energy. The uncertainties on both sides of the source and load of a HSCN are well-considered. Therein, the uncertainty of wind power is handled with chance constrained programming, while the uncertainty of hydrogen demand is addressed by a density-based clustering approach. The analysis focuses on a HSCN of Fujian Province, China and case study is conducted. Results show that the estimated hydrogen demand in Fujian Province over the course of a year is 0.197 million tons. The hydrogen production is located in Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Xiamen and the daily hydrogen production in Fuzhou is 309.11 ton/day, accounting for 57.48% of the total hydrogen production in Fujian Province. Since the revenue of the energy storage batteries cannot offset its high investment cost, the abnegation of the energy storage batteries in the HSCN is obtained. Compared with the deterministic HSCN, the total cost of the HSCN considering the uncertainties of wind power and hydrogen demand is reduced by 1.35%. The Levelized cost of hydrogen is 3.073–3.155$/kg and hydrogen production shows a significant scale effect. These results could provide information and direction to stakeholders, investors and policymakers for the planning of the future HSCN in Fujian Province to promote the tremendous development of the hydrogen industry. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

We perform both implicit and explicit evaluation of TSR as a recommender system and from new user cold starts we achieve a hit-rate@10 of 77% on a collection of 630 items with only 376 supply-chain consumer labels, and 67% with only 142 supply-chain supplier labels, demonstrating a high level of performance even with extremely few labels in challenging cold-start scenarios. TSR is suitable for any dataset featuring few labels and user and item content, where similarity of content indicates similar relationship forming capability. TSR can be used as a standalone recommender system or to complement existing high-performance recommender models that require more labels or do not support cold starts. © 2020, The Author(s).},

A predictive archetypal can analyze which articles are best acceptable to ac-quaintance backorders giving the alignment advice and time to adjust, thereby demography accom-plishes to aerate their profit. Objective: To address the issue of predicting backorders, this paper has proposed an un-supervised approach to backorder prediction using Deep Autoencoder. Methods: In this paper, artificial intelligence paradigms are researched in order to introduce a predictive model for the present unbalanced data issues, where the number of products going on backorder is rare. Results: Un-supervised anomaly detection using deep auto encoders has shown better Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic and precision-recall curves than supervised classification techniques employed with resampling techniques for imbalanced data problems. Conclusion: We demonstrated that Un-supervised anomaly detection methods specifically deep au-to-encoders can be used to learn a good representation of the data. The method can be used as a predictive model for inventory management and help to reduce the bullwhip effect, raise customer satisfaction as well as improve operational management in the organization.

	abstract = {Practical constrained optimization models are often large, and solving them in a reasonable time is a challenge in many applications. Further, many industries have limited access to professional commercial optimization solvers or computational power for use in their day-to-day operational decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to deal with the issue of solving large operational stochastic optimization problems (SOPs) by using machine learning models. We assume that decision makers have access to facilities to optimally solve their large-scale optimization model for some initial and limited period and for some test instances. This might be through a collaborative project with research institutes or through short-term use of high-performance computing facilities. We propose that longer term support can be provided by utilizing the solutions (i.e., the optimal value of the actionable decision variables) of the stochastic optimization model from this initial period to train a machine learning model to learn optimal operational decisions in the future. In this study, the proposed approach is employed to make decisions on transshipment of blood units in a network of hospitals. We compare the decisions learned by several machine learning models with the optimal results obtained if the hospitals had access to commercial optimization solvers and computational power, and with the hospital network's current empirical heuristic policy. The results show that using a trained neural network model reduces the average daily cost by about 29% compared with current policy, while the exact optimal policy reduces the average daily cost by 37%. Although optimization models cannot be fully replaced by machine learning, our proposed approach while not guaranteed to be optimal can improve operational decisions when optimization models are computationally expensive and infeasible for daily operational decisions in organizations such as not-for-profit and small and medium-sized enterprises. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Nowadays, social networks are complicated due to carrying vast arrays of data about individuals and organizations. In today’s competitive environment, companies face two significant problems: supplying resources and attracting new customers. Even the concept of supply-chain management in a virtual environment is changed. In this article, we propose a new and innovative combination approach to recommend organizational people in social networks based on organizational communication and SCM. The proposed approach uses a hybrid strategy that combines basic collaborative filtering and demographic recommendation systems, using data mining, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy techniques. The results of experiments and evaluations based on a real dataset collected from the LinkedIn social network showed that the hybrid recommendation system has higher accuracy and speed than other essential methods, even substantially has eliminated the fundamental problems with such systems, such as cold start, scalability, diversity, and serendipity. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Hardware Trojans (HTs) have become a major threat for the integrated circuit industry and supply chain and have motivated numerous developments of HT detection schemes. Although the side-channel HT detection approach is among the most promising solutions, most of the previous methods require a trusted golden chip reference. Furthermore, detection accuracy is often influenced by environmental noise and process variations. In this article, a novel electromagnetic (EM) side-channel fingerprinting-based HT detection method is proposed. Different from previous methods, the proposed solution eliminates the requirement of a trusted golden fabricated chip. Rather, only the genuine RTL code is required to generate the EM signatures as references. A factor analysis method is utilized to extract the spectral features of the HT trigger's EM radiation, and then a k-means clustering method is applied for HT detection. Experimentation on two selected sets of Trust-Hub benchmarks has been performed on FPGA platforms, and the results show that the proposed framework can detect all dormant HTs with a high confidence level.  © 2020 ACM.},

The subway power supply system provides the required electrical energy. Once the power supply is interrupted, it will not only cause the paralysis of urban rail transit, but also it will also endanger the lives of passengers and cause property damage. With the continuous development of science and technology, big data mining platform technology is fully used in value utilization. Compared with traditional data analysis, the data mined is more effective and reasonable, although there are some ways to mine data and data processing. The same, but in the mining process, research and analysis should be based on actual valuable indicators, big data mining should be used as a platform for analysis, the mining technology should be prospected, and the application of big data mining in subway power supply network operation monitoring should be explored.

BNs have transitioned from an emerging topic to a growing research area in supply chain (SC) resilience and risk analysis. As a result, there is an acute need to review existing literature to ascertain recent developments and uncover future areas of research. Despite the increasing number of publications on BNs in the domain of SC uncertainty, an extensive review on their application to SC risk and resilience is lacking. To address this gap, we analyzed research articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals from 2007 to 2019 using network analysis, visualization-based scientometric analysis, and clustering analysis. Through this study, we contribute to literature by discussing the challenges of current research, and, more importantly, identifying and proposing future research directions. The results of our survey show that further debate on the theory and application of BNs to SC resilience and risk management is a significant area of interest for both academics and practitioners. The applications of BNs, and their conjunction with machine learning algorithms to solve big data SC problems relating to uncertainty and risk, are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Each of these three technologies is currently experiencing an enormous boost in technological development and real-world implementation and is predicted to increasingly affect many aspects of fisheries and seafood trade. As any economic sector acting on global scales, fishing and seafood production are often challenged with a lack of trust along various steps of the production process and supply chain. Consumers are often not well informed on the origin and production methods of their product, management authorities can only partly control fishing and trading activities and producers can be challenged by low market prices and competition with peers. The emerging data technologies can improve the trust among agents within the fisheries sector by increasing transparency and availability of information from net to plate. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

	abstract = {Purpose: The proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) will become a large trade agreement in Asia, which has brought together the ten members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and five of the neighbors’ countries. Under the trend of globalization, the progress of the transportation industry and regional integration will increase the volume of trade, therefore maritime performance is intrinsically linked to trade. In fact, few studies have examined regional integration in the context of seaborne. This paper aims to use the cluster analysis and Poisson quasi-maximum likelihood (PQML) gravity model to investigate the trading bloc phenomenon and relation between trade and marine transportation. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, hierarchical clustering analysis and tree diagrams are used to identify functional areas characterized by bilateral trade intensity and bilateral liner shipping connectivity indices. Regional reorganizations that have occurred within Asian countries were studied. This study illustrates that these trading blocs have a positive impact on trade when maritime transport, production and trading networks have developed between regions. A gravity model was constructed using worldwide trade data for 2007, 2010 and 2015. The study considered free trade agreement (FTA)/common market (CM) of EU, RCEP and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as regional dummies and designed a real trade bloc induction variable. In addition, the study did not use the commonly adopted ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation but used the PQML method to estimate the gravity equation to overcome the problem of a large number of zero trade observations. Preliminary results show that regional integration cannot guarantee the establishment of intraregional trade but depends on the stage of economic development and regional industrial characteristics. Findings: The major findings are summarized as follows. Both liner shipping connectivity and logistics performance have significant advantages with positive coefficients in each regression results. The creation of intraregional trade is not guaranteed, depending on the characteristics of the trade and the stage of economic development of the region. For RCEP, the effect created by intra-regional trade is better than the EU. Instead, the “nominal” intra-RCEP trade was significantly below the “real” trading blocs. For RCEP, the effect created by intra-regional trade is better than that of the EU. Instead, “nominal” intra-RCEP trade is much lower than “real” trading blocs. The real trading bloc between East Asia and Taiwan clearly exists, and the bloc phenomenon is becoming more and more significant. This result shows that Taiwan’s trade flow with East Asia is higher than the normal level relationship implied by its corresponding economic and geographical conditions. Originality/value: This paper focuses on new empirical work done for this study is on the potential impact on trade. Earlier studies that have discussed and/or provided estimates of the benefits to the RCEP plan from improved transport and supply chain connectivity are cited. Marine transportation performance inherently links to economies of commerce. Few studies have examined regional integration in the context of maritime transportation, which reflects the lack of a mix of trade economists and maritime logistics research in the existing literature. This paper attempts to investigate the trading bloc phenomenon formed by regional integration (such as RCEP) and the relation between trade and marine transportation. With the official entry into force of the RCEP in 2020, it will promote increased trade and demand for logistics and maritime transport services in East Asia. © 2020, Pacific Star Group Education Foundation.},

	abstract = {Supply Chain Finance (SCF) is important for improving the effectiveness of supply chain capital operations and reducing the overall management cost of a supply chain. In recent years, with the deep integration of supply chain and Internet, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Blockchain, etc., the efficiency of supply chain financial services can be greatly promoted through building more customized risk pricing models and conducting more rigorous investment decision-making processes. However, with the rapid development of new technologies, the SCF data has been massively increased and new financial fraud behaviors or patterns are becoming more covertly scattered among normal ones. The lack of enough capability to handle the big data volumes and mitigate the financial frauds may lead to huge losses in supply chains. In this article, a distributed approach of big data mining is proposed for financial fraud detection in a supply chain, which implements the distributed deep learning model of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on big data infrastructure of Apache Spark and Hadoop to speed up the processing of the large dataset in parallel and reduce the processing time significantly. By training and testing on the continually updated SCF dataset, the approach can intelligently and automatically classify the massive data samples and discover the fraudulent financing behaviors, so as to enhance the financial fraud detection with high precision and recall rates, and reduce the losses of frauds in a supply chain. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

A novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based data-driven distributionally robust chance constrained programming framework is proposed. GAN is applied to fully extract distributional information from historical data in a nonparametric and unsupervised way without a priori approximation or assumption. Since GAN utilizes deep neural networks, complicated data distributions and modes can be learned, and it can model uncertainty efficiently and accurately. Distributionally robust chance constrained programming takes into consideration ambiguous probability distributions of uncertain parameters. To tackle the computational challenges, sample average approximation method is adopted, and the required data samples are generated by GAN in an end-to-end way through the differentiable networks. The proposed framework is then applied to supply chain optimization under demand uncertainty. The applicability of the proposed approach is illustrated through a county-level case study of a spatially explicit biofuel supply chain in Illinois. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers},

	abstract = {Unique features of solar energy, such as the low cost of operation and low pollution, make photovoltaic power plants attractive. Despite the advantages of these power plants, such as low cost of operation and operating without pollution, their high establishment cost compared to that of the conventional fossil fuel-fired power plants prevents their rapid growth. Therefore, designing and optimizing an efficient supply chain network will help to develop the photovoltaic industry. This study proposes a bi-objective model to design and optimize a thin-film photovoltaic power plant supply chain network integrating reverse logistics. The first objective minimizes the costs of supply chain network design, which optimizes decisions from suppliers to disposal centers. The second objective maximizes the efficiency of the data envelopment analysis model to find suitable locations of facilities. As there is uncertainty in electricity demand prediction and perfect foresight is not possible, a fuzzy-robust programming approach is devised to cope with the uncertain parameters. The validity and practicality of the proposed approach are investigated by a case study based on real-world data. Finally, K-Means clustering is incorporated into the model to analyze the installed photovoltaic capacity of different cities in each period. The results show that using an optimistic approach to deal with uncertainty reduces the total cost by 20% in comparison with using a pessimistic approach. The results also provide helpful insights for decision-makers and policymakers in allocating and optimizing the operation of facilities by considering the real-world characteristics of the candidate locations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to bridge the gap in the literature on supply chain finance (SCF) by exploring the relationship between network capabilities and corporate financial performance (CFP) in financial supply chains (FSCs). Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect panel data and adopt regression analysis to analyse the joint investment activities among 1359 manufacturing firms and 289 financial service providers in China to explore how network capabilities, both network power and network centrality, improve CFP in the FSCs. Findings: Under the FSCs environments, network centrality (i.e. eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality) raises CFP (ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q) and network power (node degree, clustering coefficient) also improves CFP. However, node strength from the network power stream has a negative effect on Tobin's Q, indicating that when the partner of a firm has an extremely strong influence in FSCs; this weakens the bargaining ability and flexibility of the focal firm, thus reducing its long-term financial performance. Practical implications: The joint investment activities among supply chain partners and financial service providers help managers understand the advanced financing solutions generated by internal and external network organisations as well as be aware of network capabilities' impact on CFP in FSCs. Originality/value: This study answers the call for more empirical research on SCF to provide a broader sample to examine financial supply chain management. This is one of the earliest studies to shed light on a new perspective – how network capabilities improve CFP in the FSCs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {To identify the water-use characteristics of sectors, previous studies primarily focused on measuring water use from the production side and the consumption side. In addition to sectors causing pressure on water resources as producers and drivers, there are also other important water-using sectors as primary suppliers and intermediate good suppliers. Income-based and betweenness-based methods are introduced here to measure the water use from these viewpoints. Using China as a case study, the results reveal critical differences between different perspectives, and sectors with novel water use characteristics have been identified. The K-means clustering method is used to cluster 139 sectors into five categories with distinctive features, of which the intermediate production drivers (category 2) are the critical virtual water transmission sectors which are rarely focused on before. New water-saving strategies can be revealed from the income perspective and the betweenness perspective, such as levying an income tax or improving the use efficiency of upstream input. The novelty of this study lies in the application of an unsupervised statistical learning technique to synthesize the different roles played by economic sectors for water-saving. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the complexities underlying business processes often mean that operational performance depends on a multitude of factors. Yet, at times the number of empirical cases is rather limited. This presents the challenge of discerning meaningful patterns among a large number of variables that can then be used to derive generalized frameworks and mental models for decision making. In this article, we tackle this challenge with an extension of Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation (SICE), a novel data mining technique, to address decisions in Operations and Supply Chain Management. We conduct a simulation study to validate the effectiveness of this extension in improving the accuracy and stability of pattern detection. We then apply it to an empirical dataset that is characterized by high dimension, low sample size, and lack of multivariate normal distribution. Our study pioneers the application of SICE in Operations and Supply Chain research. We also extend SICE with bootstrapping. The extended SICE is an effective technique for mining a complex empirical dataset and is a valuable aid for decision support. © 2019 Decision Sciences Institute},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral anomaly detection is a key technique of unsupervised target detection. In the hyperspectral anomaly detection based on spectral dimensional transformation, the feature projection makes it easy to distinguish the ground objects which are not distinguishable in the original feature space. Although the means of spectral dimensional transformation can improve the distinguishable between diverse categories, it cannot highlight the anomalous targets. To be able to highlight anomalous targets while improving the diversity between different ground objects, an unsupervised network model of redundant difference-value network (RDVN) is proposed and applied to hyperspectral anomaly detection. RDVN is composed of multiple single-layer neural networks with the same structure and hyper-parameters. A group of training samples is used as the input of the networks, and the difference between the activation values of any network and benchmark network is used as the error for backpropagation. After the training is completed, the difference-value between the activation values of the two networks is used as a distinguishing feature (DF). Finally, DF is used as the input of the anomaly detector to obtain the detection results. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher detection accuracy. DF not only highlights the anomalous target to increase the true positive rate but also increases the discriminability between different categories, thereby reducing the false-positive rate. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {A mining complex is an integrated value chain where the materials extracted from a group of mineral deposits are sent to different processing streams to produce sellable products. A major short-term decision in a mining complex is to determine the flow of materials that first includes deciding which handling facilities to send the extracted materials and then determining how to utilize the processing facilities. The flow of materials through the mining complex is significantly dependent on the performance of and interaction between its different components. New digital technologies, including the development of advanced sensors and monitoring devices, have enabled a mining complex to acquire new information about the performance of its different components. This paper proposes a new continuous updating framework that combines policy gradient reinforcement learning and an extended ensemble Kalman filter to adapt the short-term flow of materials in a mining complex with incoming information. The framework first uses a new extended ensemble Kalman filter to update the uncertainty models of the different components of a mining complex with new incoming information. Then, the updated uncertainty models are fed to a neural network trained using a policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm to adapt the short-term flow of materials in a mining complex. The proposed framework is applied to a copper mining complex and shows its ability to efficiently adapt the short-term flow of materials in an operational mining environment with new incoming information. The framework better meets the different production targets while improving the cumulative cash flow compared to industry standard approaches. © 2020, The Author(s).},

The planning model accounts for the production and distribution of Cheese, Yogurt, Powdered Milk and UHT milk products across a two-echelon Supply Chain. This task is undermined by the inherent variability of raw materials and finished products demand. The integrated production and distribution planning methodology introduced is based on a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming formulation. In real-world settings the number of scenarios grows substantially; thus, a scenario reduction strategy based on clustering techniques is given. A decomposition and solving strategy is also introduced and applied to a real-world case study. This study showed that the value of the stochastic solution might rise to 21.1% above the deterministic solution. This indicates the importance of considering uncertainty for dairy production and distribution. Besides, different-size instances are tested to study the scalability of the solution approach. © 2020},

	abstract = {Nowadays global supply chains enable companies to enhance competitive advantages, increase manufacturing flexibility and reduce costs through a broader selection of suppliers. Despite these benefits, however, insufficient understanding of uncertain regional differences and changes often increases risks in supply chain operations and even leads to a complete disruption of a supply chain. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a text-mining based global supply chain risk management framework involving two phases. First, the extant literature about global supply chain risks was collected and analyzed using a text-based approaches, including term frequency, correlation, and bi-gram analysis. The results of these analyses revealed whether the term-related content is important in the studied literature, and correlated topic model clustering further assisted in defining potential supply chain risk factors. A risk categorization (hierarchy) containing a total of seven global supply chain risk types and underlying risk factors was developed based on the results. In the second phase, utilizing these risk factors, sentiment analysis was conducted on online news articles, selected according to the specific type of risk, to recognize the pattern of risk variation. The risk hierarchy and sentiment analysis results can improve the understanding of regional global supply chain risks and provide guidance in supplier selection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The recent literature concerning globalizing regional development has placed significant emphasis on the Global Production Network (GPN 2.0). GPN 2.0 in economic geography emphasizes that regional growth is caused by a shift in the strategic coupling mode from a low to high level. In addition, GPN 2.0 regards firm-level value capture trajectories as key analytical object, rather than the interactive relationships among scalar and divergent actors in GPN 1.0. To provide a better understanding of causal linkages between the GPNs and uneven regional development in the background of globalization and to test the applicability of GPN 2.0 analysis framework, the paper analyzed 62 Korean-invested automotive firms in Jiangsu Province, China. In order to explore the value capture trajectories of lead firms in the GPNs, the authors applied K-means clustering method to quantitatively analyze the local supply networks of lead firms from organizational and spatial dimensions. Then, comparisons were made between strategic coupling modes of GPNs and regional development in North and South Jiangsu. This study found obvious similarities within these two regions but obvious differences between them in terms of value capture trajectories. We observed that North Jiangsu is currently in the stage of “structural coupling”, whereas South Jiangsu is in the stage of “functional coupling.” Thus, this article argues that spatial settings such as regional assets and autonomy are key factors influencing uneven economic development. This research may provide a crucial reference for the regional development of Jiangsu, China. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Since the opening of the economy, China's regional economy has developed rapidly, the overall national strength has been increasing, and the people's living standards have been continuously improved. The issue of coordinated regional development has become an important issue in today's society. Genetic algorithm is a kind of prediction algorithm that has developed rapidly in recent years and is widely used. However, when solving engineering prediction problems, there are often problems such as premature convergence and easiness to fall into local optimal solutions. Therefore, on the basis of studying the related theories of genetic algorithm and artificial immune algorithm, this paper uses the advantages of the two algorithms, combines the two algorithms, and proposes an improved algorithm for genetic algorithm-adaptive immune genetic algorithm. Taking genetic algorithm as the basic framework, the operators and selection methods of artificial immune algorithm are integrated. Using the adaptive concept, the formulas of adaptive crossover probability and mutation probability are innovatively designed. Compared with the fixed value of the immune genetic algorithm, the introduction of the adaptive concept can intelligently adjust the optimization process and increase the optimization speed. Considering the double uncertain factors of product market demand and waste product recycling in the remanufacturing supply chain system, the maximization of logistics network operating profit, the minimization of environmental impact, and the maximization of customer satisfaction are the forecast goals. The market demand of uncertain products is effectively controlled through the option contract mechanism, and a multiobjective forecasting model based on the option contract mechanism is established. According to the characteristics of the model, an improved immune genetic algorithm is designed to solve the problem, and the effectiveness of the immune genetic algorithm is verified through an example.  © 2021 Yang Yang.},

	abstract = {Rapid advances of sensing and cloud technologies transform the manufacturing system into a data-rich environment and make production scheduling increasingly complex. Traditional offline scheduling methods are limited in the ability to handle low-volume-high-mix workorders with diverse design specifications. Simulation-based methods show the promise for distributed scheduling of manufacturing jobs but are mostly implemented with historical data and empirical rules in a static manner. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms fuel increasing interests to solve dynamic scheduling problems in the manufacturing setting. However, it's difficult to utilize high-dimensional data for production scheduling while considering multiple practical objectives for smart manufacturing (e.g., minimize the makespan, reduce production costs, balance workloads). Therefore, this paper presents a new AI scheduler with composite reward functions for data-driven dynamic scheduling of manufacturing jobs under uncertainty in a smart factory. Internet-enabled sensor networks are deployed in the smart factory to track real-time statuses of workorders, machines, and material handling systems. A novel manufacturing value network is developed to take high-dimensional data as the input and then learn the state-action values for real-time decision making. Based on reinforcement learning (RL), composite rewards help the AI scheduler learn efficiently to achieve multiple objectives for production scheduling in real time. The proposed methodology is evaluated and validated with experimental studies in a smart manufacturing setting. Experimental results show that the new AI scheduler not only improves the multi-objective performance metrics in the production scheduling problem but also effectively copes with unexpected events (e.g., urgent workorders, machine failures) in manufacturing systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework, based on the picture fuzzy exponential entropy, and the VIsekriterijumska optimizacija i KOmpromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method, is proposed to manage SSS problems. Firstly, the evaluation criteria of SSS, including economic, environmental and social, is established. This can be evaluated in the form of the actual data or linguistic terms provided by suppliers and experts respectively in an actual decision-making process. Then, according to the translated scales, all the evaluation information can be converted into picture fuzzy numbers (PFNs). Secondly, the picture fuzzy exponential entropy is defined. Moreover, based on the entropy’s minimization principle, the defined picture fuzzy exponential entropy is used to determine the weight of the SSS’s criteria. Thirdly, the extended VIKOR method, which combines the grey correlation coefficient, is utilized to select a suitable supplier. This method avoids the shortcomings of the traditional VIKOR method in data mining and solves the conflict between SSS criteria. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed integrated decision framework are verified by an experiment, as well as a sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study research contributes in fulfilling the gap by carrying out a systematic literature review (SLR) of contemporary research studies in closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). To the best of the author’s knowledge, an SLR rooted in bibliometric analysis has not been carried focusing on advent developments in CLSC. SLR employs scientific methodologies to select papers from standard databases. The SLR using advanced bibliometric and network analysis enables unveiling the key features of the contemporary literature. Design/methodology/approach: The author has analyzed over 333 documents published from 2008 and onward. Using the contemporary tools from bibliometric analysis tools, the author presented an exploratory analysis. A network analysis is utilized to visualize literature and create clusters for the cocited research studies, keywords and publication sources. A detailed multivariate analysis of most influential works published based top 100 articles via a cocitation matrix is done. The multivariate analysis used k-means clustering in which optimal number of clusters are estimated. The analysis is further extended by using a factor analysis, which enables determining the most influential clusters in the k-means clustering analysis. Findings: The SLR using a bibliometric and network analysis enables unveiling the key features of the contemporary literature in CLSC. The author examined published research for influential authors, sources, region, among other key aspects. Network analysis enabled visualizing the clusters of cocited research studies, cowords and publication sources. Cluster analysis of cocited research studies is further explored using k-means clustering. Factor analysis extends findings by identifying most contributing grouping of research areas within CLSC research. Each clustering technique disclosed a unique grouping structure. Originality/value: CLSC has received considerable attention, and its core areas start with focusing on reverse logistics concepts relating reuse, recycling, remanufacturing, among others. Contemporarily, the studies have enhanced reverse logistics core functionalities interfaced with the other interesting avenues related to CO2 emission reduction, greening and environmental protection, sustainability, product design and governmental policies. Earlier studies have presented a literature review of CLSC; however, these reviews are commonly conducted in the traditional manner where the authors select papers based on their area of expertise, interest and experience. As such these reviews fall short in utilizing the advanced tools from bibliometric analysis. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study employs a systematic literature analysis and open expert interviews, combining the perspectives of science and practice. For each analyzed case, we identified the objectives behind the implemented measures. Using qualitative clustering, we categorized the located objectives into fields of action. The identified 13 fields of action provide an overview of the objectives of food loss prevention measures. The results indicate that different levels of importance can be assigned to these fields of action. In particular, the results show the relevance of increased network cooperation and transparency within a company and along the entire value chain. Furthermore, the study indicates that the creation of transparency provides the greatest overall added value in terms of reducing food losses. © 2020 by the author.},

While retail analytics plays an increasingly important role in successful retailing management, comprehensive store segmentation based on Data Mining-based Retail Analytics is still an under-researched area. This study seeks to address this gap by developing a novel approach to segment the stores of retail chains based on ‘purchasing behavior of customers’ and applying it in a case study. The applicability and benefits of using Data Mining techniques to examine purchasing behavior and identify store segments are demonstrated in a case study of a global retail chain in Istanbul, Turkey. Over 600 K transaction data of a global grocery retailer are analyzed and 175 stores in Istanbul are successfully segmented into five segments. The results suggest that the proposed new retail analytics approach enables the retail chain to identify clusters of stores in different regions using all transaction data and advances our understanding of store segmentation at the store level. The proposed approach will provide the retail chain the opportunity to manage store clusters by making data-driven decisions in marketing, customer relationship management, supply chain management, inventory management and demand forecasting. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In addition to its capacity of providing preference-based recommendations as an unsupervised learning methodology, it has been also proven useful in sales forecasting, product introduction and other production related businesses. Since some consumers and companies need a recommendation or prediction for future budget, labor and supply chain coordination, dynamic recommender systems for precise forecasting have become extremely necessary. In this article, we propose a new recommendation method, namely the dynamic tensor recommender system (DTRS), which aims particularly at forecasting future recommendation. The proposed method utilizes a tensor-valued function of time to integrate time and contextual information, and creates a time-varying coefficient model for temporal tensor factorization through a polynomial spline approximation. Major advantages of the proposed method include competitive future recommendation predictions and effective prediction interval estimations. In theory, we establish the convergence rate of the proposed tensor factorization and asymptotic normality of the spline coefficient estimator. The proposed method is applied to simulations, IRI marketing data and Last.fm data. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of future time forecasting. © 2021 Yanqing Zhang, Xuan Bi, Niansheng Tang and Annie Qu.},

Design/methodology/approach: The authors identify and cluster risk factors in RL by using risk management theory. Experts in RL and supply chain risk management validated the risk factors via a questionnaire. An unsupervised data mining method, self-organising map, is utilised to cluster RL risk factors into homogeneous categories. Findings: A total of 41 risk factors in the context of RL were identified and clustered into three different groups: strategic, tactical and operational. Risk mitigation strategies are recommended to mitigate the RL risk factors by drawing on supply chain risk management approaches. Originality/value: This paper studies risks in RL and recommends risk management strategies to control and mitigate risk factors to implement RL successfully. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In order to ensure that future-proof talent can continue to emerge in this discipline, the role of SCM executives is extremely important. Although many studies have been conducted in the field of talent management (TM), the future role of SCM executives has been mostly neglected in research. The present empirical study addresses this gap, taking into consideration the fourth industrial revolution, as innovation in technology continues to drive significant changes in the SCM field. Aiming to investigate the extent to which increasing digitalization is influencing the future role of SCM executives, a Delphi study with 103 experts from industry, academics, and politics/associations was carried out. In order to identify meaningful topic clusters from the data, fuzzy c-means clustering was used. From an actor-network theory perspective, our results show that in some areas of TM, digitalization is leading to a strong fusion of SCM executives and digital technologies, as well as to a clear division of roles, in which either SCM leaders or technology will dominate in the future. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the topological properties of the global supply chain network in terms of its degree distribution, clustering coefficient, degree-degree correlation, bow-tie structure, and community structure to test the efficient supply chain propositions proposed by E. J.S. Hearnshaw et al. The global supply chain data in the year 2017 are constructed by collecting various company data from the web site of Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ platform. The in- and out-degree distributions are characterized by a power law of the form of γin = 2.42 and γout = 2.11. The clustering coefficient decays hCðkÞi ∼ k bk with an exponent βk = 0.46. The nodal degree-degree correlations hknn(k)i indicates the absence of assortativity. The bow-tie structure of giant weakly connected component (GWCC) reveals that the OUT component is the largest and consists 41.1% of all firms. The giant strong connected component (GSCC) is comprised of 16.4% of all firms. We observe that upstream or downstream firms are located a few steps away from the GSCC. Furthermore, we uncover the community structures of the network and characterize them according to their location and industry classification. We observe that the largest community consists of the consumer discretionary sector based mainly in the United States (US). These firms belong to the OUT component in the bow-tie structure of the global supply chain network. Finally, we confirm the validity of Hearnshaw et al.’s efficient supply chain propositions, namely Proposition S1 (short path length), Proposition S2 (power-law degree distribution), Proposition S3 (high clustering coefficient), Proposition S4 (“fit-gets-richer” growth mechanism), Proposition S5 (truncation of power-law degree distribution), and Proposition S7 (community structure with overlapping boundaries) regarding the global supply chain network. While the original propositions S1 just mentioned a short path length, we found the short path from the GSCC to IN and OUT by analyzing the bow-tie structure. Therefore, the short path length in the bow-tie structure is a conceptual addition to the original propositions of Hearnshaw. Copyright: © 2020 Chakraborty, Ikeda.

Database of agricultural residues including location, availability and price throughout Thailand was accumulated based on top seven highest availability sources. Cost model was developed to compare cost when different types of agricultural residues were utilized to generate either electricity or heat. Cluster analysis was applied in the demand side analysis by clustering biomass power plants which were located within 50 km radius from the same centroid. Transportation cost was estimated from the biomass source to the corresponding demand centroid. The cost model for transporting agricultural residues to the demand location was then proposed. From the cost model of transporting agricultural residues, a biomass power plant was chosen as examples. It was shown that when the biomass power plant replaced eucalyptus barks with corncobs, the production cost could be reduced by more than 60%. From the analysis, it was also revealed that the most important factors that a biomass power plant should consider were energy content and cost of the raw material, as well as availability of the nearest supply source. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Agricultural food production is projected to be 70% higher by 2050 than it is today, with the world population rising to more than 9 billion, 34% higher than it is now. The farmers have been forced to produce more with the same resources. This pressure means that optimizing productivity is one of the main objectives of the producers but also in a sustainable way. Not only does agriculture face a decline in production, but it has also had to face limitations in data collection, storing, securing, and sharing, climate change, increases in input prices, traditional food supply chain systems where there is no direct connection between the farmer and the buyer, and limitations on energy use. Existing IoT-based agriculture systems have a centralized format and operate in isolation, leaving room for unresolved issues and major concerns, including data security, manipulation, and single failure points. This paper proposes a futuristic IoT with a blockchain model to meet these challenges. Further, this paper also proposes and novel energy-efficient clustering IoT-based agriculture protocol for lower energy consumption and network stability and compares its results with its counterpart low-energy adoptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol network stability is 23% higher as compared to LEACH as first node of LEACH dies at 168 rounds while IoT-based agriculture first node dies after 463 rounds. Similarly, IoT-based agriculture protocol energy consumption is 68% lower than that of LEACH. The proposed protocol also extends the network life to more rounds and demonstrates an increase of 112%.  © 2021 Sabir Awan et al.},

This article extends the SCND model to a large-scale SCND with uncertainties (LUSCND), which is more practical but also more challenging. However, it is difficult for traditional approaches to obtain the feasible solutions in the large-scale search space within the limited time. This article proposes a cooperative coevolutionary bare-bones particle swarm optimization (CCBBPSO) with function independent decomposition (FID), called CCBBPSO-FID, for a multiperiod three-echelon LUSCND problem. For the large-scale issue, binary encoding of the original model is converted to integer encoding for dimensionality reduction, and a novel FID is designed to efficiently decompose the problem. For obtaining the feasible solutions, two repair methods are designed to repair the infeasible solutions that appear frequently in the LUSCND problem. A step translation method is proposed to deal with the variables out of bounds, and a labeled reposition operator with adaptive probabilities is designed to repair the infeasible solutions that violate the constraints. Experiments are conducted on 405 instances with three different scales. The results show that CCBBPSO-FID has an evident superiority over contestant algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.},

OGD is becoming a major source for knowledge and innovation to generate economic value, if properly used. However, currently there are no standards or frameworks for applying knowledge continuum tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to improve elicit knowledge extraction from OGD in a consistent manner. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a comprehensive review of literature on both OGD and knowledge management (KM) frameworks. It provides insights into the extraction of knowledge from OGD by using a vast array of phased KM TTPs into the OGD lifecycle phases. Findings: The paper proposes a knowledge iterative value network (KIVN) as a new conceptual model that applies the principles of KM on OGD. KIVN operates through applying KM TTPs to transfer and transform discrete data into valuable knowledge. Research limitations/implications: This model covers the most important knowledge elicitation steps; however, users who are interested in using KIVN phases may need to slightly customize it based on their environment and OGD policy and procedure. Practical implications: After its validation, the model allows facilitating systemic manipulation of OGD for both data-consuming industries and data-producing governments to establish new business models and governance schemes to better make use of OGD. Originality/value: This paper offers new perspectives on eliciting knowledge from OGD and discussing crucial, but overlooked area of the OGD arena, namely, knowledge extraction through KM principles. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Sustainability commitments by private sector actors are emerging as interventions to help reduce global deforestation. Much attention is placed on the forest conservation impact of these interventions in areas where commodity production constitutes a main driver of deforestation. It is, however, less clearly understood what role they could play in areas where the production of commodities is not evidently leading to the loss of forest and how they could contribute to other objectives including sustainable rural development and peacebuilding. In this paper, we examine the potential of the cocoa sector in Colombia in achieving deforestation reduction and peacebuilding simultaneously, as aimed by the country's Cocoa, Forests and Peace Initiative. Results from correlations and spatially explicit analyses show that regardless of its widespread production across Colombia, in the past fifteen years cocoa has not been an important driver of deforestation. This suggests that efforts to end deforestation in the Colombian cocoa sector emerged following global trends, and not because of an evident link between cocoa production and deforestation. Furthermore, results from spatial clustering analyses highlight areas where different types of value chain interventions may be appropriate to parallel forest conservation and peacebuilding, while interviews with key actors in the cocoa sector provide clues as to how these interventions should be developed and implemented. Specifically, our results show that narratives around approaches to achieve zero deforestation from agricultural commodities should (1) be adjusted to local contexts, (2) incorporate location-specific development needs, (3) complement existing rural development efforts, (4) enhance collaboration among actors that operate both within and beyond the value chain, and (5) apply high-resolution data to assess deforestation-commodity relations and verify zero-deforestation commitments. These considerations are particularly relevant in contexts where commodity production is not evidently leading to deforestation, as in the case of cocoa production in Colombia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

However, such an approach leads to scattered literature and the possibility (or risk) that the focus could spin out of control in terms of the existing themes and future research trends. Consequently, the aim of this research is twofold: (i) to identify the main overarching themes discussed in the past and track their evolution over time, and (ii) propose a future research agenda for each overarching theme that considers the multidisciplinary nature of research efforts made on the topic. To reach the first objective, a method based on text mining was implemented. To reach the second one, a review based on recent and relevant paper was made for each overarching theme. Text mining suggests four overarching themes: (i) business, (ii) operations, (iii) technological solutions and (iv) work and skills. ‘Business’ includes studies that investigate the impact of Industry 4.0 on business perspectives and they suggest that governments and industries have a change in manufacturing perspective and attempt to benefit from this industrial revolution wave. ‘Operations’ includes studies investigating the impact of Industry 4.0 new technologies on production, logistics, and supply-chain processes. Manuscripts belonging to ‘Technological solutions’ discuss technological solutions at the core of Industry 4.0. ‘Work and skills’ stream of literature attempts to under the human element lurking behind the scene of Industry 4.0 regarding opportunities and implications. Finally, the paper suggests a future research agenda for each overarching theme, thus paving the way for new research on the topic. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Spatial information science has a critical role to play in meeting the major challenges facing society in the coming decades, including feeding a population of 10 billion by 2050, addressing environmental degradation, and acting on climate change. Agriculture and agri-food value-chains, dependent on spatial information, are also central. Due to agriculture's dual role as not only a producer of food, fibre, and fuel but also as a major land, water, and energy consumer, agriculture is at the centre of both the food-water-energyenvironment nexus and resource security debates. The recent confluence of a number of advances in data analytics, cloud computing, remote sensing, computer vision, robotic and drone platforms, and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and networks have lead to a significant reduction in the cost of acquiring and processing data for decision support in the agricultural sector. When combined with costeffective automation through development of swarm farming technologies, these technologies have the potential to decouple productivity and cost efficiency from economies of size, reducing the need to increase farm size to remain economically viable. We argue that these pressures and opportunities are driving agricultural value-chains towards high-resolution data-driven decision-making, where even decisions made by small rural landowners can be data-driven. We survey recent innovations in data, especially focusing on sensor, spatial, and data mining technologies with a view to their agricultural application; discuss economic feasibility for small farmers; and identify some technical challenges that need to be solved to reap the benefits. Flexibly composable information resources, coupled with sophisticated data sharing technologies, and machine learning with transparently embedded spatial and aspatial methods are all required. © by the author(s).},

	abstract = {The last mile problem of E-grocery Distribution comprises one of the most costly and highest polluting components of the supply chain in which companies deliver goods to end customers. To reduce transport cost and fuel emissions, a new element of ground-based delivery services, autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs), is included in the E-grocery distribution system for improving delivery efficiency. Thus, the objective of this study is to optimize a two-echelon distribution network for efficient E-grocery delivery, where conventional vans serve the delivery in the first echelon and ADVs serve delivery in the second echelon. The problem is formulated as a two-echelon vehicle routing problem with mixed vehicles (2E-VRP-MV) with a nonlinear objective function, in which the total transport and emission costs are optimized. This optimization is based on the flow assignment at each echelon and to realize routing choice for both the van and ADV. A two-step clustering-based hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (C-GA-PSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. First, the end customers are clustered to the intermediate depots, named satellites, based on the minimized distance and maximized demand. To enhance the efficiency of resolving the 2E-VRP-MV-model, a hybrid GA-PSO algorithm is adopted to solve the vehicle routing problem. Computational results of up to 21, 32, 50, and 100 customers show the effectiveness of the methods developed here. At last, the impacts of the layout of the depot-customer and customer density on the total cost are analyzed. This study sheds light on the tactical planning of the multi-echelon sustainable E-grocery delivery network.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Biofuel has an important role in alleviating the environmental pollution problem. More attention has been paid to optimization of biofuel supply chain in recent years. In this paper, a scientific, rational and practical biodiesel processing plant location with waste oil as the raw material was proposed in order to provide a theoretical basis for guiding the planning and management of restaurants, waste oil collection points, and processing plants. Considering the merits and demerits of the subjective and objective weighting methods, this paper proposes a new weighting method which is namely the combination of rough set theory and clustering algorithm. It then verifies the location results with a plant carbon emission. At last, this paper analyzes the location of biodiesel processing plant in the Yangtze River Delta of China and finds that the precision has been greatly improved with the new method comparing the RMSE and the R2 of the Delphi method with the improved rough set theory. By using this method, the weights of the influencing factors of biodiesel processing plants are the following: Waste oil supply 0.143, Fixed construction cost factor 0.343, Biodiesel demand 0.143 and Location convenience 0.371. In the comparison between the robust optimization method and the improved rough set theory, it was found that the final location results are the same, all being Jiaxing City. However, the improved rough set theory is much simpler than the robust optimization algorithm in the calculation process. © 2020 University of Rijeka. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Pig production in the United States is based on multi-site systems in which pigs are transported between farms after the conclusion of each particular production phase. Although ground transportation is a critical component of the pork supply chain, it might constitute a potential route of infectious disease dissemination. Here, we used a time series network analysis to: (1) describe pig movement flow in a multi-site production system in Iowa, USA, (2) conduct percolation analysis to investigate network robustness to interventions for diseases with different transmissibility, and (3) assess the potential impact of each farm type on disease dissemination across the system. Movement reports from 2014–2016 were provided by Iowa Select Farms, Iowa Fall, IA. A total of 76,566 shipments across sites was analyzed, and time series network analyses with temporal resolution of 1, 3, 6, 12, and 36 months were considered. The general topological properties of networks with resolution of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were compared with the whole period static network (36 months) and included the following features: number of nodes and edges, degree assortativity, density, average path length, diameter, clustering coefficients, giant strongly connected component, giant weakly connected component, giant in component, and giant out component. Small-world and scale-free topologies, centrality parameters, and percolation analysis were investigated for the networks with 1-month window. Networks’ robustness to interventions was assessed by using the Basic Reproduction Number (R0). Centrality parameters indicate that gilt development units (GDU), nursery, and sow farms have more central role in the pig production hierarchical structure. Therefore, they are potentially major factors of introduction and spread of diseases over the system. Wean-to-finishing and finishing sites displayed high in-degree values, indicating that they are more susceptible to be infected. Percolation analysis combined with general properties (i.e. heavy-tailed distributions and degree disassortative) suggested that networks with 1-month time resolution were highly responsive to interventions. Furthermore, the characteristics of a disease should have strong implications in the biosecurity practices across production sites. For instance, biosecurity practices should be focused on sow farms for highly contagious disease (e.g., foot and mouth disease), while it should target nursery sites in the case of a less contagious diseases (i.e. mycobacterial infections). Understanding the patterns of swine movements is crucial for the swine industry decision-making in the case of an epidemic, as well as to design cost-effective approaches to monitor, prevent, control and eradicate infectious diseases in multi-site systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

This is due to the great possibility of natural disaster and moral hazard by the actors in fisheries which lead to the instability of value chain on fisheries commodity from downstream to upstream. Thus, a study must be done in order to explore and minimize the disturbance of the stream of value chain in fisheries. This study aims to investigate the attributes playing big role on affecting value chain cooperation among actors in fisheries commodity in Kei Islands. Data mining is used on the study to determine factors playing major roles in smoothing cooperation in value chain of fisheries commodity, with 220 datasets obtained from actors in fisheries micro-enterprises in Kei Islands taken from August to November, 2019. The result shows that, on average, weights of four data mining techniques; namely support vector machine, fast large margin, logistic regression, naïve bayes and generalized linear model all appear to put management as the leading factor that contributes the most for the cooperation of value chain of fisheries commodity in Kei Islands. This finding implicates that management on all micro-enterprises of fisheries business in Kei Islands has to be the main focus, which is mainly related to basic knowledge on conducting cooperation and maintaining relationship among all actors in fisheries sector, therefore, NGO and local government need to step in and play role on educating all actors for better good governance of the business to obtain the great sustainability in the value chain of fisheries commodity in the region. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

	abstract = {This research paper is concerned with potential barriers to the transition to a circular economy business model (CEBM) on the firm-level. Using a case study in the electronics manufacturing industry, we identify and analyze barriers in terms of their impact along the value chain (VC) as well as the level of difficulty required to overcome them. This allows us to map barriers to managerial responsibilities, thus improving the organizational transition process. The key findings of this research are: (1) To scale up CEBM on the firm-level, additional changes need to be implemented next to the oft-cited and discussed changes towards a Product-Service-System (PSS) and reverse logistics. Based on literature research and our case study, we put forward an extensive list of 29 potential barriers. (2) As managerial and financial resources are limited, we also suggest a priority ranking for barriers. Specifically, we show that barriers should be prioritized along the dimensions of their organizational resistivity and their impact on the VC. Organizational resistivity refers to the estimated effort along managerial time, financial resources, and cultural resistance for change, while VC impact refers to the ability of the barrier to influence and re-direct product, parts, and material flows along the foreword and reverse supply chain. This type of barrier assessment is new to the literature. (3) We argue that the proposed method for barrier prioritization, which we term the Circular Economy Matrix, can be readily transferred to manufacturing firms in other industries. (4) Clustering the barriers along managerial responsibilities (sets of barriers) is shown to lead to a more efficient and effective transition, as gauged by incurred transaction costs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Based on the traditional BP neural network, it is easy to get into the local optimal problem due to the long training time of the model. By using the simple Johnson algorithm, the dimensionality of the input neuron is reduced, and then the hidden layer neural network is determined by this method. At the same time, the data mining method is used to filter the Data.Particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the parameters. At the same time, based on the domestic e-commerce Sales network data, the results show that the average square root error of the model is less than the traditional BP neural network and the learning efficiency is higher than the traditional BP neural network. The results show that the model has a great advantage in building up a large number of historical data, and it can shorten the modeling time and get good prediction result by combining the sales data of e-commerce.

	abstract = {Botanical dietary supplements are complex mixtures with numerous potential sources of variation along the supply chain from raw plant material to the market. Approaches for determining sufficient similarity (ie, complex mixture read-across) may be required to extrapolate efficacy or safety data from a tested sample to other products containing the botanical ingredient(s) of interest. In this work, screening-level approaches for generating both chemical and biological-response profiles were used to evaluate the similarity of black cohosh (Actaea racemosa) and Echinacea purpurea samples to well-characterized National Toxicology Program (NTP) test articles. Data from nontargeted chemical analyses and gene expression of toxicologically important hepatic receptor pathways (aryl hydrocarbon receptor [AhR], constitutive androstane receptor [CAR], pregnane X receptor [PXR], farnesoid X receptor [FXR], and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha [PPARα]) in primary human hepatocyte cultures were used to determine similarity through hierarchical clustering. Although there were differences in chemical profiles across black cohosh samples, these differences were not reflected in the biological-response profiles. These findings highlight the complexity of biological-response dynamics that may not be reflected in chemical composition profiles. Thus, biological-response data could be used as the primary basis for determining similarity among black cohosh samples. Samples of E. purpurea displayed better correlation in similarity across chemical and biological-response measures. The general approaches described herein can be applied to complex mixtures with unidentified active constituents to determine when data from a tested mixture (eg, NTP test article) can be used for hazard identification of sufficiently similar mixtures, with the knowledge of toxicological targets informing assay selection when possible. © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Toxicology 2019.},

	abstract = {Landfill restrictions on certain materials and products have provided the impetus to seek for a more sustainable utilisation of waste in a circular economy. These restrictions compounded with legislation and value factors necessitate an urgent solution to address the issue of carbon or glass fibre reinforced composite waste disposal. There is currently no mutual agreement on waste ownership among stakeholders. This study examined composite manufacturers in the United Kingdom and determined the waste volumes available within these companies. A new approach that combined mathematical modelling of supply chain complexity, centre-of-gravity method and K-Means algorithm was developed to determine the optimum location of third parties that could process waste for a number of supply chain providers. The paper is a presentation of new knowledge and proposes a scientific approach for identifying possible optimum locations for recycling centres. More significantly, this process could be used for clustering and reducing supply chains complexity to enable the setting up of multiple and optimally located recycling centres. The results have indicated that the approach could minimise carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emission associated with transporting cores or waste to processing centres. This work is of generic importance that could be implemented across other waste and aspects of a circular economy such as remanufacturing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The paper deals with a new approach to the clustering of world economies with respect of their inclusion to global value networks. The goal of the paper is to study micro-aspects of global economic integration and to question on whether GVCs foster mega-regionalization. World bank enterprises survey data covering 2005-2017 on specific indicators describing reporting countries’ enterprises openness to global economy and OECD-EORA GVC-related indicators were used for research purposes. Methodologically paper is split into several parts: first part is devoted to the analysis of the evolution of country’s involvement into global economy from micro-aspects; the second part represents the first attempt to group countries with respect to openness to trade as a key in PTAs signing; the third part represents clustering of economies for 2011 and 2017 separately as well as analyses how similar they are in their respective progress in chosen indicators between these two time-periods. It was found that the higher the use of foreign inputs by firms-the more frequent is the reporting on customs and trade procedures, as well as access to finance, being the main obstacles, supporting the fact that countries try to set up international partnerships and enter foreign markets via starting local production. Using Kendall rang correlation as a base for cluster analysis and performing clustering on the base of growth terms of indicators chosen, it was shown that regional character of clustering persists (pool of Latin American countries, African countries, CEE, Asia countries are clearly observed) with minor exclusions, and non-trivial links between regions are in place. It could be concluded that there is a high possibility of empirically tested relation between micro-motivation behind global value chains functioning and neo-regionalism in the form of mega-regions set-up. © 2020, Transition Academia Press.

It is a method to meet the increasing customer requirements on delivery service and simultaneously to reduce operational costs. This paper presents a case of anticipatory shipping in the context of agro-food supply chains. The challenge in these chains is the product perishability that leads to product obsolescence in the case of un-balanced supply and demand. This study introduces a data-driven approach that integrates product quality characteristics in data analytics to identify suitable products for anticipatory shipping at the strategic level. It also proposes process redesigns concerning production and transportation at the operational level to realise anticipatory shipping. Finally, using historical data from a Dutch floriculture supplier as input for a multi-agent simulation, the proposed approach and process redesigns are verified. The simulation output shows that anticipatory shipping could increase delivery service level up to 35.3% and reduce associated costs up to 9.3%. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Five types of ISs use were classified as a result of clustering based on nine activities suggested in Porter's theory of competitive advantage. For these cluster types, ANOVA showed differences for all the company factors derived from the TOE framework. In particular, it revealed distinct differences in technical factors and in organisational factors. However, environmental factors did not indicate as much of difference. This study was meaningful as it analysed the main characteristics of the company in the value chain rather than just individual IS activities. It also suggests significant implications for alternative policies, such as the operation of industrial complexes and the activities they focus on under the constraints of SMEs.

	abstract = {As information and communication technology evolves and expands, business and markets are linked to form a complex international network, thus generating plenty of cross-border trading activities in the supply chain network. Through the observations from a typical cross-border supply chain network, this paper introduces the fuzzy reliability-oriented 2-hub center problem with cluster-based policy, which is a special case of the well-studied hub location problem (HLP). This problem differs from the classical HLP in the sense that (i) the hub-and-spoke (H&S) network is grouped into two clusters in advance based on their cross-border geographic features, and (ii) a fuzzy reliability optimization approach based on the possibility measure is developed. The proposed problem is first modeled through a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation that maximizes the reliability of the entire cross-border supply chain network. Then, some linearization techniques are implemented to derive a linear model, which can be efficiently solved by exact algorithms run by CPLEX for only small instances. To counteract the difficulty for solving the proposed problem in realistic-sized instances, a tabu search (TS) algorithm with two types of move operators (called "Swap I" and "Swap II") is further developed. Finally, a series of numerical experiments based on the Turkish network and randomly generated large-scale datasets are set up to verify the applicability of the proposed model as well as the superiority of the TS algorithm compared to the CPLEX. © 2020 Chenyi Yan et al.},

In order to realize the optimal scheduling and automatic identification of port logistics service supply chain information, it is necessary to design the contract coordination management of port logistics service supply chain information. A coordinated management model of port logistics service supply chain information contract based on grid area reconstruction learning clustering is proposed. The fuzzy association rule scheduling technology is used to sample the port logistics service supply chain information, and the port logistics service supply chain information collected by RFID is processed by information fusion. The autocorrelation statistical regression analysis method is used to extract the correlation statistical features of port logistics service supply chain information, and the matching filtering method is used to detect the redundant features of port logistics service supply chain information for interference suppression filtering. The purified port logistics service supply chain information is reconstructed by phase space reconstruction technology, and the reconstructed data is classified and identified by grid area reconstruction learning clustering classifier. The contract coordination management and automatic retrieval of port logistics service supply chain information are realized. The simulation results show that the automatic classification of port logistics service supply chain information contract coordination management is good, and the fuzzy clustering ability is strong, which improves the coordination management ability of port logistics service supply chain information contract. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.},

Suppliers contribute significantly to establishing an effective sustainable supply chain. Hence industries need to evaluate its potential suppliers precisely on sustainability criteria. In this work, a two-phase decision model using Fuzzy Interference System (FIS) along with Fuzzy Kano philosophy for the sustainable environment has been proposed to select sustainable suppliers for a large scale industry. In the first phase, sustainability criteria clustering using fuzzy Kano model has been performed for the identification of ‘Must-be’ criteria in economic, environmental and social dimensions. Further, sub-criteria with quantified evaluation levels for Must-be criteria have been established. In the second phase, the three distinct Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) has been developed for evaluating the Sustainability Performance Index (SPI) values of each supplier in three sustainability dimensions. In FIS, the architecture of each model is modified in such a way that each FIS engine have to compute the minimum number of rules. Finally, weights are assigned to SPI in each dimension, and suppliers are ranked for final selection. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed decision framework. A sustainable supplier selection problem of the iron and steel industry of India has been investigated to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed decision framework. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The optimal membership sequence of the cooperation is determined according to the strict monotone path. To analyze and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a regional petrol supply network in Chongqing city in China is investigated. Through cooperation between petrol depots in the supply network, the utilization of customer clustering, time window coordination, and distribution truck sharing can significantly reduce the total operation costs and improve the efficiency of urban transportation energy supply. This approach can provide theoretical support for relevant government departments and enterprises to make optimal decisions. The implementation of the joint distribution of energy can promote the sustainable development of urban transportation.  © 2020 Guangcan Xu et al.},

	abstract = {In recent years, major local and global disruptions have had significant adverse effects on corporate performance, particularly for businesses with long, global supply chains. Managing disruption and its effects has therefore become a key focus for firms. While the process of disruption management has attracted considerable research attention, much of it has been directed at the pre-disruption stage. This study investigates the post-disruption stage, and its management. The unpredictability of disruption magnitude and nature suggests that the post-disruption management process may be as important, if not more so, than pre-determined pre-disruption strategies. An effective post-disruption management process would directly affect actual ability to recover from sudden and serious disruptions. This study analyzes six companies, variously positioned upstream and downstream in the supply chain of the information and communications technology (ICT) industry in Taiwan. Specific factors and strategies relating to the post-disruption management process were collected by conducting in-depth interviews with the managers and executives of the firms. The information was categorized into distinct disruption management process stages: discovery, recovery, and supply chain redesign. The study findings are interesting and at times, new and counter-intuitive, including the surprising positive effects of clustering in disruptions, and the role of back-up supplier and material verification in disruption recovery. The study emerges with an integrated framework that can be utilized to establish an effective post-disruption management process. The framework is used to develop research propositions for future research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Accurate demand forecasting in pharmaceutical industries has always been one of the main concerns of planning managers because a lot of downstream supply chain activities depend on the amount of final product demand. In the current study, a five-step intelligent algorithm is presented based on data mining and neural network techniques to forecast demand in pharmaceutical industries. The main idea of the proposed approach is clustering samples and developing separate neural network models for each cluster. Using the obtained data, the performance of the proposed approach was assessed in a pharmaceutical factory. The optimal number of clusters for this case was four. Mean arctangent absolute percentage error, average relative variance, and correlation coefficient (R) were used to evaluate the performance of different neural network structures. The results of performing the models once for all data and once for the data of each single cluster showed that the forecasting error significantly decreased thanks to using this approach. Furthermore, the results indicated that clustering products not only raises the prediction accuracy but also enables a more reliable assessment of forecasted values for each single cluster. Such analyses are very important and useful for managers of marketing and planning departments in pharmaceutical units. © 2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.},

It has become an urgent problem for all countries in the world as how to make effective use of various safety inspection techniques, optimize the food processing and storage safety, predict potential food safety factors, and accurately assess and predict food safety risks. This study proposes a food safety risk prediction method based on brain neural network algorithm. Firstly, the key control points and index factors in the food safety supply chain are analyzed from the perspective of the food supply chain. Then the SOM self-organizing map and the K-means clustering method are used to select the data sets with high aggregation and low coupling to be used as training samples of neural network algorithm. Finally, three kinds of data are verified by BP neural network algorithm. The experimental results show that in food safety risk assessment and prediction, the data processed by two stages have better mean square error convergence, which increases the accuracy of neural network algorithm and improves the prediction effect. It provides a new prediction method for food safety risk prediction, which is of important practical significance. © 2020 Parlar Scientific Publications. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A number of governments are making building information modeling (BIM) a mandatory requirement for all public works construction projects. While main contractors may be ready to comply with such requirements, the supply chain as whole may be vulnerable as lower-tier suppliers may not be able to adopt BIM. There is currently no objective approach to assessing BIM maturity; hence, this paper aims to develop a new approach to determine suppliers’ current vision and execution-based capabilities to exploit BIM and their capacity to reach a higher maturity level. Design/methodology/approach: Based on UK Government BIM maturity levels, the authors exploit a unique data set made available by a main contractor, to determine a data-driven approach, using K-means, to assess the capabilities and vision of its supply base. Findings: The authors find a direct comparison between our suggested K-means clusters and the UK Government’s BIM maturity levels. However, in interrogating specific cases, the authors find that using a subjective approach would have wrongly categorized certain companies. The authors also determine what capability and strategic developments are required for companies to move to a higher level. Research limitations/implications: The method aligns with the existing UK BIM maturity model and enhances the model by determining the likelihood of a supplier in progressing to a higher level of maturity. The research was with a single case company, exploiting their existing survey instrument and data. A more comprehensive study could be adopted with a generic survey questionnaire. Practical implications: The research may be exploited by companies to take a strategic approach to assess suppliers in BIM adoption and to establish supplier development mechanisms. Originality/value: The data-driven approach avoids ambiguity of categories and mis-categorizing suppliers. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In recent years, the rise of intelligent technology has had a great impact on the supply chain of new energy vehicles, which, coupled with the complexity of the supply chain itself, puts it at great risk. Therefore, it is quite indispensable to evaluate the risk of the new energy vehicle supply chain. This paper assesses the risks faced by China's new energy vehicle supply chain in this period of technological transformation. First of all, this paper establishes an evaluation criteria system of 16 sub-criterion related to three dimensions: the market risk, operational risk, and the environmental risk. Then, variable weight theory is proposed to modify the constant weight obtained by the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). Finally, a risk assessment of China's new energy vehicle supply chain is carried out by combining the variable weight and the cloud model. This method can effectively explain the randomness of matters, and avoid the influence of value abnormality on the criteria system. The results show that China's new energy vehicle supply chain is at a high level. Through the identification of risk factors, mainly referring to the low clustering risk, technical level risk and information transparency risk, this paper can provide a risk prevention reference for corresponding enterprises. © 2020 by the authors.},

Its goal is to achieve a smart factory to reduce lead time to respond to the customers’ demand or to unforeseen events and improve productivity in the system. Using this concept can lead to improvements in manufacturing, supply chain (SC), and logistics. The adoption of Industry 4.0 in supply chain management (SCM) is a new and critical subject with a need for more research. A few studies have started reviewing the existing works on Industry 4.0; however, they do not focus on its role in SCM. This paper presents a systematic review and synthesis of the current literature on Industry 4.0 in SCM that brings out some interesting findings, which will be helpful for the academic and industry, especially top managers. This work identifies three categories from the content of the papers as exploratory vs. confirmatory, qualitative vs. quantitative, management level vs. process/technology level.

Variability in feedstock properties impacts feeding, handling, equipment operations, and conversion performance. Feedstock quality attributes, and their variations, are often overlooked in assessing feedstock value and utilization for conversion to fuels, chemicals, and products. This study developed and employed a multiscale analytical characterization approach coupled with data analytic methods to better understand the sources and distribution of feedstock quality variability through evaluation of 24 corn stover bales collected in 4 counties of Iowa. In total, 216 core samples were generated by sampling nine positions on each bale using a reliable bale coring process. The samples were characterized for a broad suite of physicochemical properties ranging across field and bale, macro, micro, and molecular scales. Results demonstrated that feedstock quality attributes can vary at all spatial scales and that multiple sources of variability must be considered in order to establish and manage biomass quality for conversion processes. © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method of generating a business strategy using value chain analysis. There were 186 manufacturing and industrial enterprises from the Czech Republic. The analysis was carried out using mathematical-statistical methods (dimensional reduction, logit regression and its transformation in order to objectify the opinion level of the managers) and with a neural network in terms of validation of the results of the mathematical-statistical methods. The aim was to determine the significance of different parts of the value chain in terms of their impact on the profitability of an enterprise and to demonstrate its important role in the process of generating business strategy. The significance for the profitability of the enterprises was statistically proven in the area of scientific and technological development, input logistics and human resource management. These parts were identified by the authors as the golden triangle of manufacturing and industry. Purchasing and output logistics were identified as the parts with a negative impact to the profitability of the enterprises. Strong underestimation of scientific and technological development by the top managers of the manufacturing and industrial enterprises is seen as a very negative finding. Neural networks showed higher statistical sensitivity compared to the mathematical-statistical methods (dimensional reduction and logit regression). They defined the value sector chain with the following structure (ranked from the highest degree of positive impact on the profitability of the enterprise): human resource management, scientific and technological development, production, input logistics, purchasing, material management, output logistics, enterprise infrastructure, marketing and sales, service and other supporting services. In conclusion, it is stated that the sector value chain of manufacturing and industrial enterprises will be further decomposed into value chain models of specific industries of the production and industry, such as engineering and construction, intended for direct use in different business entities to generate their unique value chains and corporate strategies. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Due to the economic benefits and environmental awareness, most of the battery manufacturing industries in India are interested to redesign their existing supply chain network or to incorporate the effective closed loop supply chain network (CLSCN). The purpose of this paper is to develop CLSCN model with eco-friendly distribution network and also enhance recycling to utilize recycled lead for new battery production. The existing CLSCN model of a battery manufacturing industry considered for case study is customized for attaining economic benefit and environmental safety. Hence, single objective, multi-echelon, multi-period and multi-product CLSCN model with centralized depots (CD) is developed in this work to maximize the profit and reduce the emission of CO2 in transportation. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed CD has the facility to store new batteries (NB), scrap batteries (SB) and lead ingot. The objective of the proposed research work is to identify potential location of CD using K-means clustering algorithm, to allocate facilities with CD using multi-facility allocation (MFA) algorithm and to minimize overall travel distance by allowing bidirectional flow of materials and products between facilities. The proposed eco-friendly CLSCN-CD model is solved using GAMS 23.5 for optimal solutions. Findings: The performance of the proposed model is validated by comparing with existing model. The evaluation reveals that the proposed model is better than the existing model. The sensitivity analysis is demonstrated with different rate of return of SB, different proportion of recycled lead and different type of vehicles, which will help the management to take appropriate decision in the context of cost savings. Originality/value: This research work has proposed single objective, multi echelon, multi period and multi product CLSCN-CD model in the battery manufacturing industry to maximize the profit and reduce the CO2 emission in transportation, by enhancing the bidirectional flow of materials/products between facilities of entire model. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The last few years have seen a great number of announcements and projections on cities of the future, where technological interconnected metering infrastructure is the main smart-grid unit, promoting higher sustainability due to its more efficient management capability. The water supply network is one of the grids that has been given additional attention due to the problem of waste caused by water leakage, usually requiring rapid detection for fast intervention to prevent high costs. With centralised information coming from the grid, like the measurement of pressure and flow, it is revealed that anomaly detection could be an important tool for quick automatic detection without needing permanent analysis by a human operator. However, there is a need for a more robust approach, especially when noisy data are present. In this paper, we propose the implementation of a new approach based on a hybrid expectation maximization (EM) Gaussian model combined with a t-distribution mixture. This approach is compared to both a pure EM Gaussian mixture model and a t-distribution mixture model that can use labelled data or not. Each EM algorithm was applied to real data acquired from a water supply grid with the aim of automatically detecting water leaks. Using the newly developed approach, the results show that detection is both possible and more accurate for this type of database. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Academic entrepreneurship performance has become the core research content of academic entrepreneurial activities and the growth of entrepreneurial enterprises as a reflection of the academic entrepreneurship process and essence. Among them, university teachers are playing a social function that is equivalent to the enterprise innovation and entrepreneurship, embedding in the spiral mechanism of regional entrepreneurship, industrial, and value chains. However, studies on the academic entrepreneurship performance of university teachers are limited. Therefore, from the academic entrepreneurship data of 10 university teachers with active academic entrepreneurship behavior in China from 2012 to 2016, this study analyzes the approximate dependence of the academic entrepreneurship performance input and output indicators of university teachers. The rough set fuzzy clustering analysis method is used for the first time to measure the importance of academic entrepreneurship input and output indicators of university teachers in the entire entrepreneurial performance indicator system. In addition, this study analyzes the fuzzy evaluation of the academic entrepreneurship performance of university teachers. The objectives are to eliminate the subjectivity of weight setting, reduce the scale of the index, and establish an objective and effective evaluation index system. Results show that among the attributes of the academic entrepreneurial input and output conditions of university teachers, financial salary input and research funding are the reductions of five entrepreneurial output decision attributes. Moreover, financial salary input and research funding are the most important indicators and have a two-factor relationship with entrepreneurial output. The number of spin-off companies should not be selected as an indicator of entrepreneurial performance due to the almost zero discernable relationship with entrepreneurial input. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

	abstract = {The goal of maritime traffic management is to provide a safe and efficient maritime environment for different type of vessels facilitating port logistics and supply chain business. However, current maritime traffic management mainly relies on the massive individual vessel's data for decision making. Lack of macro-level understanding of vessel crowd movement around port challenges maritime safety and traffic efficiency. In this paper, we describe a spatio-temporal data mining method to discover crowd movement patterns of vessels from their short-term history data. The method first captures vessels' crowd movement features by building vessels' tracklets with their speed and location. A movement vector clustering algorithm is developed to find different travel behaviors for different group of vessels. With nonparametric regression on the classified vessel movement vectors which represent the crowd travel behaviors, an overall vessel movement pattern can then be discovered. In this research, we tested real trajectory data of vessels near Singapore ports. Comparing with the actual massive vessel movement data, we found that this method was able to extract vessels' crowd movement information. The hotspots on risk area in terms of vessel traffic and speed can be identified. The method can be used to provide decision-making support for maritime traffic management.  © 2019 Rong Wen et al., published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {Contemporary integrated circuits (ICs) are increasingly being constructed using intellectual property blocks (IPs) obtained from third parties in a globalized supply chain. The increased vulnerability to adversarial changes during this untrusted supply chain raises concerns about the integrity of the end product. The difference in the levels of abstraction between the initial specification and the final available circuit design poses a challenge for analyzing the final circuit for malicious insertions. Reverse engineering presents one way to help reduce the difficulty of circuit analysis and inspection. In this work, we provide a framework that given (i) a gate-level netlist of a design and (ii) a block diagram for the design with relative sizes of the blocks, outputs a matching between the partitions of the circuit and blocks in the block diagram. We first compute a geometric embedding for each node in the circuit and then apply a clustering algorithm on the embedding features to obtain circuit partitions. Each partition is then mapped to the high-level blocks in the block diagram. These partitions can then be further analyzed for malicious insertions with much reduced complexity in comparison with the full chip. We tested our algorithm on different designs with varying sizes to evaluate the efficacy of algorithm, including the open-source processor OpenSparc T1, and showed that we can successfully match over 90% of gates to their corresponding blocks. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

	abstract = {The strengthening scientific and reasonable quantitative evaluation of innovation performance of low-carbon technology breakthrough innovation network in manufacturing industry under the background of economic globalization is of important significance, which can enrich relevant theoretical system of low-carbon technology breakthrough and improve the core competitiveness of Chinese manufacturing industries. In this paper, the scientific and reasonable quantitative evaluation of the innovation performance of low-carbon technology breakthrough innovation network is firstly determined as a dynamic (time-varying) evaluation problem, which involves multi-source influencing factors. Note that many evaluation objects in the innovation performance of an innovation network are gray, ambiguous and dynamic variables, which are difficult to be quantified and the collected industrial data has certain discreteness and fluctuation. Hence, a fuzzy clustering analysis on influencing variables of innovation performance of low-carbon technology innovation network is carried out via the sampling data from 28 manufacturing industries during 2011-2016. Moreover, an innovation performance evaluation model for low-carbon technology innovation network is constructed through analytic hierarchy process (AHP), grey theory and fuzzy clustering analysis. Based on this model, the qualitative and quantitative evaluations of innovation performances of the innovation network before and after low-carbon technology breakthrough are realized. The results show that the low-carbon technology breakthrough innovation has a positive effect on improving the development level of manufacturing industry. In addition, the construction performance evaluation model not only decreases the influences of subjective factors by combining qualitative analysis with quantitative analysis, but also applies the grey theory innovatively to determine the membership matrix. It realizes accurate, systematic and scientific evaluation of the innovation performance of the low-carbon technology breakthrough innovation network in the manufacturing industries. Finally, the research conclusions provide the theoretical and practical references to the strategic arrangement of the low-carbon technology breakthrough innovation in Chinese manufacturing industries.

This study contributes to the developing body of research in retail logistics through evaluating the role of logistics clustering in improving inbound supply performance. Qualitative data were collected through 26 interviews from various actors inside a logistics cluster in Jordan. Results show how close coordination in logistics clusters contributed to improved inbound supply performance through achieving delivery velocity, physical supply flexibility, reduced inbound transport cost and inventory carrying cost. Residing in logistics clusters has led to improved operational efficiencies, reduced inbound response time and smoothed flow of material in the retail channel. The study also provides insights on how logistics clustering has improved supply resiliency of the Jordanian vulnerable supply chains through joint knowledge creation. Finally, this study provides implications for logistics and retail supply chain managers. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The heath-care sector has confronted significant difficulties in the past few years due to several issues such as insufficient human resources, budget cuts, and shortage of equipment and drugs. The logistics in the health-care sector take an extensive part of the budget, especially since it is the main axis to provide the hospital's pharmacies with goods (drugs and materials).The delay in the delivery of drugs, inappropriate transport conditions, and quality are the main challenges for the health-care supply chain. These issues will affect the user and hospital satisfaction and product quality during transportation/storage. The Geo-Distributed storages play a considerable role to provide equipment and drugs faster, thus, routing and scheduling method and also clustering method for geographic data is needed for defining regions and areas to be served by distributed storage. Having multiple storages to severe multiple health-care facilities it can be presented as Multiple Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP) which can be solved using metaheuristics, however, the MDVRP cannot take into account the nature of the context (health-care), priority, and capacity of the facility to serve which is in this context the hospital bed capacity (HBC). This paper presents a new smart logistic method for the health-care sector to provide a better drug pulling system, by using the clustering method to provide a suitable location for new pharmacies and using genetic algorithm to perform routing and scheduling for Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP) in the health-care context to feed the hospital's pharmacies with goods. This approach considers planned routes from the depot (central/regional pharmacy) to hospitals, as chromosomes, and groups the chromosome based on geographic distance and hospital bed capacity as a cluster. This method provides results with minimal computing power and resources and less calculation time. © 2020 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent trade reports suggest that RFID implementation continues to lag lofty projections. A primary concern is that, despite the high cost of implementing RFID systems, realized read-rates fall short of expectations. This results in the invisible inventory conundrum whereby tagged merchandise may still not be accurately represented in inventory records. Drawing from data science to address this issue, we ask: How can directed data mining models be used to identify laboratory test performance criteria for RFID tags that operate reliably across the idiosyncratic facilities (i.e., unique DCs, warehouses, and stores) that comprise apparel retailers’ supply chains? We investigate this question by advancing a methodology that integrates laboratory test performance data, field tests of RFID tags fixed to apparel items and scanned under normal operating conditions, and the application of five directed data mining models to the integrated data set of laboratory and field test results. Our analyses of 45,416 observations show that two directed data mining models may identify—with near-100% accuracy—laboratory test criteria that discriminate tags having 99% or greater read-rates in the field. Accordingly, our study validates a generalizable methodology for identifying technical performance standards for tags that operate reliably within apparel retailers’ supply chains. © Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals},

	abstract = {The geographical constrain of small islands associated with fisheries commodities, is due to the lack of insufficient infrastructure and socio-economy characteristics, in addition to the nature of fisheries commodities where the durability and inconsistency of quality and quantity of the particular region become very vulnerable to uncertainty of supply chain. This study aims to formulate a strategy to mitigate the existing effect of uncertainty supply chain in Southeast Maluku Regency. The data mining approach with naïve bayes was used to determine the clusters of areas with high to low interdependency in villages and sub-districts. In addition, the House of Risk (HOR) was used to identify the cause of risks and provided the most effective and efficient alternative strategy to mitigate the uncertainty of the fisheries' supply chain sector. Data were collected from 28 villages to obtain 322 datasets by using the purposive sampling technique and expert assessment method for the data mining process, and HOR, respectively. The result show that the village location, resources, and fishermen's ability to sell and buy their gear were the main determinant factors of interdependency. Furthermore, there were, at least, three clusters of interdependencies with the integration of a web-based system to help spread information to fishermen and aquaculture farmers. In conclusion, policymakers need to be more adaptable to the use of information technology to efficiently improve the welfare and performance of coastal communities, aside from constantly enhancing the region's infrastructure. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science.},

	abstract = {Construction industry activities, frommaterial extraction to the end of the structure life, affect the environment negatively. For a sustainable construction process, economically, environmentally, and socially friendly practices are essential, and reverse logistics is one solution that can provide such an approach. In reverse logistics, obsolete products are reused in a new production, while reducing negative effects to the environment. In this study, we assess the current state of research on reverse logistics practices in the construction industry. The study presents a comparative data mining analysis, followed by a content analysis. The results show that the construction industry literature ignores the impact of reverse logistics practices on upstream construction activities. We argue that industry practitioners must take reverse logistics decisions in the early phases of the construction process by considering both upstream and end-of-life construction activities, and we recommend a reverse logistics decision framework for successful reverse logistics implementation. The findings of this research are significant for decision-makers in the industry. We urge that sustainable practices be employed in the industry. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis is suggested to strengthen the arguments made in this article. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As enterprises pay more and more attention to environmental issues, the green supply chain management (GSCM) mode has been extensively utilized to guarantee profit and sustainable development. Green supplier selection (GSS), which is a key segment of GSCM, has been investigated to put forward plenty of GSS approaches. At present, enterprises prefer to construct the large-scale teams of decision makers to obtain the more reasonable ranking results during GSS process. However, the existing methods pay little attention to the large-scale GSS procedure. To investigate the GSS issue with a large-scale group of decision makers, a new GSS approach under a q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy environment is developed. The q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy numbers are introduced to describe the evaluation information of green suppliers. Combined with a clustering approach and several clustering principles, the large-scale decision makers are divided into several subgroups. Next, the similarity measures between the evaluation matrices are computed to determine the weights of subgroups, and the collective evaluation information can be obtained using the q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy aggregation operator. According to the weighted entropy measure, the weights of criteria are calculated; then, the q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form (q-RIVOF-MULTIMOORA) method is constructed to determine the best green supplier. At last, a practical GSS example is applied to show the feasibility of the proposed approach, and the sensitivity and comparative analyses indicate that for the large-scale GSS issues, the proposed approach can obtain the more robust and reasonable ranking results. © 2019 by the authors.},

To help accelerate the development of its large-scale production, a mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed which systematically designs and optimizes the entire wastewater sludge-to-biodiesel supply chain over multiple periods. To cope with uncertainty, this paper adopts data-driven robust optimization which constructs the uncertainty sets from the data of uncertain parameters by means of support vector clustering, whereas the conventional uncertainty sets are driven without incorporating the data which result in high cost of robustness. Furthermore, the developed uncertainty set encloses the fuzzy support neighborhood of data samples, making it practical even when the available data is limited. The applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated through a case study in Iran. The results show that the proposed approach is able to yield robust supply chain decisions with the same degree of robustness but at a lower cost compared to the conventional robust optimization approaches. © 2019},

Based on complex network theory, we reconstructed the running mechanism of logistics service providers, integrators, and demanders. We constructed an improved structure model of LSSC. By observing the selected three indicators (clustering coefficient, maximum connectivity, and network connectivity efficiency), the influence caused by the problem will continue to spread to more subjects along the network when a problem exists in one part of the network. The results showed that the destructive power of deliberate attacks is far greater than the damage caused by random attacks, and the disruption of logistics service integrators will considerably increase the vulnerability of the LSSC. However, even if logistics service integrators are removed completely, the LSSC still can operate at low efficiency. Through a case analysis, we identified the vulnerable nodes in logistics service, clarify the vulnerable mechanism in LSSC, and provide guidance for the operation of LSSC in real life. © 2020 by the authors.},

The research is aimed at developing a methodological approach to healthcare customer loyalty assessment, including identification of target and profitable segments, regulation of business processes, analysis of the customer database and business environment of an organization to increase the effectiveness of its marketing activities. Systemic research of customer relationships includes the following methods and tools: Data Mining methods with instrumental support of Statistica software, including factor analysis and formation of databases of endogenous and exogenous variables; specification of a mathematical model; correlation analysis; variable multiple linear regression analysis based on the generalized least squares method; model verification using R2-statistics and Fisher (F-test) and Student (t-test) criteria; ABC-and XYZ analysis of revealing customer consumption profiles; the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on expert assessments of the multicriteria problem solution while evaluating the support tools for managing consumer loyalty with a hierarchical structure. The practical and theoretical significance of the results. A methodological approach has been developed to identify healthcare facility (HCF) customer preferences, implemented using a variable multiple linear regression model, including both quantitative (age, number of bed days, etc.) and qualitative (social status, gender, marital status, parental status, education, medical service type) exogenous variables. Consumption profiles of HCF services have been constructed on the basis of their clustering and classification using ABC-and XYZ analyzes. An algorithm for evaluating the support tools of the consumer loyalty analysis has been proposed. The analysis of consumer demand for the organization's services enables to develop an algorithm for assessing consumer loyalty management information systems, to form a system of indicators characterizing potential customers and their preferences in the medical services market; the most rational and customer-oriented services that reflect the customer's consumption profile. The results can be used as practical tools for improving the economic efficiency of the organization depending on the cluster dynamics of consumption and changes in personal customer characteristics and CRM-based marketing performance support tools. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

	abstract = {One of the greatest 21st century challenges is meeting the need to feed a growing world population which is expected to increase by about 35% by 2050. To meet this challenge, it is necessary to make major improvements on current food production and distribution systems capabilities, as well as to adapt these systems to expected trends such as climate change. Changing climate patterns may present opportunities for unidentified, geographical regions with adequate climate patterns to produce high-value agricultural products in a profitable and sustainable manner. This paper focuses on the design and planning aspects of a discovery process to unearth agri-food supply chains capable of generating attractive return on investments. A stochastic optimization framework is used to develop planting and harvesting schedules for a set of identified regions with complementary weather characteristics. To address the high-level of variability in the problem context, a two-stage stochastic decomposition method is used to consider a larger number of scenarios. As part of the solution process, a modeling scheme is developed that learns past interactions between entering discretized, weather scenarios and optimal first-stage solutions. In this context, machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques are used to iteratively estimate each region's probability of belonging to first-stage solutions based on previous solution-scenario results. The implementation of the stochastic framework is shown through a case study applied to multiple locations within the US southwest states of Arizona and New Mexico. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Regular inspections of belt conveyors are required to prevent the damage of transported objects. Nevertheless, inspections can be troublesome for belt conveyors composed of a plurality of belt lines with multiple branches. To improve the inspection process, an inspection device composed of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) inside a transported object was introduced in our previous study jointly with an algorithm to detect anomalies in the joints of the belt lines. When belt conveying this device for inspection, however, it is required to not only detect the anomaly but also know its position. This study presents a novel method to estimate the position of the inspection device along the belt conveyor using a deep neural network (DNN). The DNN uses the IMU data to detect seven types of features (passage through five types of joints, device stoppage and regular transport), which, when matched to data on a belt conveyor position database, can correctly be translated into positions. Additionally, the proposed method enables the detection of changes of routes along the belt conveyor that occur when a belt line branches into two output streams. To enhance the DNN feature detections, two original algorithms for DNN output post-processing are also introduced. Experiments with a complex belt conveyor demonstrate this method can successfully detect the position of the inspected device more accurately and more cost-effectively than conventional methods. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Failing to mitigate propagation of disease spread can result in dire economic consequences for agricultural networks. Pathogens like Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus, can quickly spread among producers. Biosecurity is designed to prevent infection transmission. When considering biosecurity investments, management must balance the cost of protection versus the consequences of contracting an infection. Thus, an examination of the decision making processes associated with investment in biosecurity is important for enhancing system wide biosecurity. Data gathered from experimental gaming simulations can provide insights into behavioral strategies and inform the development of decision support systems. We created an online digital experiment to simulate outbreak scenarios among swine production supply chains, where participants were tasked with making biosecurity investment decisions. In Experiment One, we quantified the risk associated with each participant's decisions and delineated three dominant categories of risk attitudes: risk averse, risk tolerant, and opportunistic. Each risk class exhibited unique approaches in reaction to risk and disease information. We also tested how information uncertainty affects risk aversion, by varying the amount of visibility of the infection as well as the amount of biosecurity implemented across the system. We found evidence that more visibility in the number of infected sites increases risk averse behaviors, while more visibility in the amount of neighboring biosecurity increased risk taking behaviors. In Experiment Two, we were surprised to find no evidence for differences in behavior of livestock specialists compared to Amazon Mechanical Turk participants. Our findings provide support for using experimental gaming simulations to study how risk communication affects behavior, which can provide insights towards more effective messaging strategies.

	abstract = {Industry 4.0 focuses on the realization of smart manufacturing from shop floors to factories and to the whole supply chain. As a key technology of smart manufacturing, cyber-physical system has been widely discussed in the aspects of system design, data collection and processing, and cyber-physical synchronization. In a smart shop floor, manufacturing resources with intelligence and autonomy are abstracted as cyber-physical system units. They can communicate with each other autonomously to make optimal production decisions according to the real-time status of the shop floor. In this article, an autonomous collaboration network comprised of cyber-physical system–based smart manufacturing resources is modeled by using complex network theory. The collaboration activities among them are further analyzed, from which the information of key cyber-physical system units and key collaboration relationships are excavated. A demonstrative case is studied to verify the feasibility of the proposed model. From the case, it can be seen that (1) autonomous collaboration network has a small-world feature; (2) cyber-physical system units with bigger degrees and the collaborative relationships with bigger tightness are more important; (3) the workload of cyber-physical system units needs to be balanced because some cyber-physical system units have exceeded their capacities; and (4) cyber-physical system units with larger collaboration clustering coefficients will attract other nodes to form communities centered by them. Based on these results, the autonomous production control and management of smart shop floor will become more accurate, efficient, and balanced. © IMechE 2019.},

Therefore, this study aims to investigate cyber risk management in supply chain contexts. Design/methodology/approach: Adapting a systematic literature review process, papers from interdisciplinary areas published between 1990 and 2017 were selected. Different typologies, developed for conducting descriptive and thematic analysis, were established using data mining techniques to conduct a comprehensive, replicable and transparent review. Findings: The review identifies multiple future research directions for cyber security/resilience in supply chains. A conceptual model is developed, which indicates a strong link between information technology, organisational and supply chain security systems. The human/behavioural elements within cyber security risk are found to be critical; however, behavioural risks have attracted less attention because of a perceived bias towards technical (data, application and network) risks. There is a need for raising risk awareness, standardised policies, collaborative strategies and empirical models for creating supply chain cyber-resilience. Research limitations/implications: Different types of cyber risks and their points of penetration, propagation levels, consequences and mitigation measures are identified. The conceptual model developed in this study drives an agenda for future research on supply chain cyber security/resilience. Practical implications: A multi-perspective, systematic study provides a holistic guide for practitioners in understanding cyber-physical systems. The cyber risk challenges and the mitigation strategies identified support supply chain managers in making informed decisions. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review on managing cyber risks in supply chains. The review defines supply chain cyber risk and develops a conceptual model for supply chain cyber security systems and an agenda for future studies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Over the past 30 years, scholars have been calling for modern management theory and research to consider how strategic management tools could be applied to enhance corporate sustainability. While strategic management for sustainability has emerged as a multidisciplinary field, the existing knowledge base has yet to be systematic reviewed. This paper responded to the literature gap by conducting a bibliometric review of strategic management for sustainability. The paper aimed to document the landscape and composition of this literature through the analysis of 988 relevant Scopus-indexed documents. Data analyses found that the strategic management for sustainability knowledge base remained an emergent field with increasing interests from diverse groups of international scholars in various fields, particularly in environmental science, engineering, and strategic business management. Over the past three decades, the literatures have been continuously grown from a few publications in the early 1990s to almost 1000 documents to date. The review found that the most influential journals and authors of this knowledge base were international in scope but predominately from Western developed countries. Five Schools of Thought from author co-citation analysis revealed the intellectual clustering composition of the knowledge base on strategic management for sustainability: corporate sustainability strategy, sustainable waste management, strategic sustainability systems, strategic sustainability management and entrepreneurship, and sustainability assessment strategy. Key topics addressed in this research include the distribution of documents across the most highly cited journals, reflecting the breadth, quality and influential scholars in the strategic management for sustainability knowledge domain, naming of the influential scholars in the field and identification of contemporary foci and research front in the existing literature through the keyword co-occurrence analysis and co-word map. The strategic management for sustainability field has evolved from the key topics related to the green movement at the policy-driven macro level (i.e., ecological or environmental protection/impact, water/waste management and natural resource conservation) to the practicality in organizations with the topics related to social strategic responsibility and business management issues (i.e., corporate strategy, project management, supply chain management, information management, adaptive management, corporate sustainability). In addition to a retrospective, insightful prospective interpretation, practical implication, limitations and future research direction are discussed. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Responding in a timely manner to product recalls emanating from the supply chain presents tremendous challenges for most firms. The source might be a supplier from the same industry located next door, or one from a completely different sector of the economy situated thousands of miles away. Yet the speed of the firm’s response is crucial to mitigating the consequences of the recall both for the firm, and consumer health and well-being. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of geographic distance, industry relatedness and clustering on firm response time to a supplier-initiated product recall. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the theoretical framework via an examination of food recall announcements registered with the US Food and Drug Administration over a ten-year period. The authors develop a data set comprising 407 pairs of supplier and affected downstream manufacturing firms, and utilize cross-classified hierarchical linear modeling to understand the drivers of organizational responsiveness. Findings: The results suggest that firm response time is lengthened by geographic distance but reduced when the supplier and affected firm operate in related industry sectors. The authors further find that as more firms in a given industry are affected by the same recall, response time deteriorates. Originality/value: Product recalls in the agri-food industry are significant events initiated to protect consumer health and ensure the safety of the farm-to-fork food chain. The findings highlight how both geographic- and industry-related factors determine the speed of firm responsiveness to these events. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

With a practical approach, using a case study in a company in the food sector, this article proposes an inventory classification method with qualitative and quantitative variables, using data mining techniques, categorizing the materials using variables such as picking frequency, consumption rates and qualitative characteristics regarding their handling in the warehouse. The proposed model also integrates the classification of materials with techniques for locating facilities, to support decision-making on inventory management and storage operations. Methods: This article uses a method based on the Partitioning Around Medoids algorithm that includes, in an innovative way, the application of a strategy for the location of the optimal picking point based on the cluster classification considering the qualitative and quantitative factors that represent the most significant impact or priority for inventory management in the company. Results: The results obtained with this model, improve the routes of distributed materials based on the identification of their characteristics such as the frequency of collection and handling of materials, allowing to reorganize and increase the storage capacity of the different SKUs, passing from a classification by families to a cluster classification. Furthermore, the results support decision-making on storage capacity, allowing the space required by the materials that make up the different clusters to be identified. Conclusions: This article provides an approach to improving decision-making for inventory management, showing a proposal for a warehouse distribution design with data mining techniques, which use indicators and key attributes for operational performance for a case study in a company. The use of data mining techniques such as PAM clustering makes it possible to group the inventory into different clusters considering both qualitative and quantitative factors. The clustering proposal with PAM offers a more realistic approach to the problem of inventory management, where factors as diverse as time and capacities must be considered, to the types and handling that must be had with the materials inside the warehouse. © Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska Citation: Granillo-Macías R., 2020.

	abstract = {Around 30% to 70% of products in retail and services experience low demand, including spare parts and components for nearly all types of machinery and equipment industries. A detailed analysis of stock forecasting methods for the low demand represents a research gap in inventory management. The existing clustering methods, that is, ABC analysis and XYZ analysis (based on coefficient of variation), do not allow identification of the consumption process dynamics and, therefore, cannot be used for the classification and improvement of forecasting models for stock consumption. This paper surveys special cases of inventory management with low demand. The results of one- and two-dimensional stock classifications are presented. The limitations of the economic order quantity (EOQ) model for inventory management strategies are determined. Methods of inventory parameter calculations for products with low demand are suggested. Integrated time series forecasting models, along with algorithms to estimate the inventory forecasting parameters, are proposed with regard to products with low demand. The basis for the suggested models is the following concept: all the available sources of quantitative and qualitative information should be used for managerial decision-making under uncertainty and risk. Calculations for time series with low demand are conducted for testing purposes. The obtained results confirm the adequateness of the suggested concept, aimed at solving the problem of cost reduction in supply chains. © 2020},

	abstract = {Retailers are a major component of almost any supply chain and are the interface between customers and goods. A ubiquitous and important retailing segment is grocery stores, yet almost no analytical work in the block design can be found in the literature. This paper uses a data-driven approach coupled with optimization to address block layout in grocery stores with the participation of Migros, the largest retailer in Turkey. The goal is to develop an effective analytical method for solving realistic grocery store block layout problems considering data which describes revenue generation and adjacency of departments. Historic market basket data is used to characterize certain important aspects that relate to customer sales and these are used in a tabu search meta-heuristic to find layouts which are likely to enhance revenue. To consider the objectives of revenue and adjacency simultaneously, a bi-objective approach is used. A set of non-dominated designs is generated for a decision maker to consider further and the generated designs have been validated with a detailed stochastic simulation model and by the marketing experts at Migros. According to the computational results and the feedback from the industry partner, this approach is both effective and pragmatic for a data-driven, analytic design of grocery store block layouts. Layout designs which improve revenues and desired adjacencies relative to the existing store layouts are identified. While this paper focuses on a single retailer, the approach is general and given that grocery layout is similar worldwide, the method and results should be easily translatable to other retailers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Supply chain management is closely related to the application efficiency of PC, but only in the last three years has this interdisciplinary research received due attention. The prefabricated construction supply chain management (PCSCM) have not received enough attention. Especially recently, the related literature shows explosive growth. This paper adopted the method of systematic literature review through the tool of bibliometric statistics. And we reviewed 152 articles from 2001 to 2018, with the goal of understanding the current situation, trends, and gaps in PCSCM research, and a framework is proposed to promote its development. First, the study discussed the four themes of clustering, concentrating mainly on strategic research and project evaluation, PC supply chain process design and optimization, supply chain integration and management, and the application of advanced technology. Then, the research gaps and conceptual development framework to promote PCSCM were reported. Only through the coordinated development of technology, market circumstances, and decision-making level of participants, can the PCSC form an integrated whole, so as to optimize the efficiency and sustainability of prefabricated construction industry and improve its level. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to discover the distribution and trends of existing Offsite construction (OSC) literature with an intention to highlight research niches and propose the future outline. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopted literature reviews methodology involving 1,057 relevant documents published in 2008-2017 from 15 journals. The selected documents were empirically analyzed through a topic-modeling technique. A latent Dirichlet allocation model was applied to each document to infer 50 key topics. A machine learning for language toolkit was used to get topic posterior word distribution and word composition. Findings: This is an exploratory study, which identifies the distribution of topics and themes; the trend of topics and themes; journal distribution trends; and comparative topic, themes and journal distribution trend. The distribution and trends show an increase in researcher’s interest and the journal’s priority on OSC research. Nevertheless, OSC existing literature is faced with; under-researched topics such as building information modeling, smart construction and marketing. The under-researched themes include organizational management, supply chain and context. The authors also found an overload of similar information in prefabrication and concrete topics. Furthermore, the innovative methods and constraints themes were found to be overloaded with similar information. Research limitations/implications: The naming of the themes was based on our own interpretation; hence, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, a comparative study using different data processing is proposed. The study also provides future research outline as follows: studying OSC topics from dynamic evolution perspective and identifying the new emerging topics; searching for effective strategies to enhance OSC research; identifying the contribution of countries, affiliation and funding agency; and studying the impact of these themes to the adoption of OSC. Practical implications: This study is of values to the scholars, as it could stimulate research to under-researched areas. Originality/value: This paper justifies a need to have a broad understanding of the nature and structure of existing OSC literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We constructed a model to describe information asymmetry among lender and borrower based on game theory and conducted numerical simulation to discuss risk contagion. The static comparison and numerical results illustrate that the loan interest in symmetric case is significantly lower than it in asymmetric case. Default risk of buyer increases the cost of borrower compared to the case when buyer pays for sure and massive trade credit associated with higher loan interest. However the impact on loan amount of credit risk and default risk is more complex. It turns out that information asymmetry can be seen as a moderating factor in the impact on loan amount of default risk and credit risk. Generally this study may not only bring some policy implications for banks to control credit risk along supply chain, but also shed lights in theoretical analysis of trade credit. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {In supply chain network (SCN) management, multi-objective Pareto optimization means the network can meet the demand for both minimal cost and minimal lead-time in SCN. Due to the compromise between cost and lead-time, it is a non-trivial issue to search for multi-objective Pareto optimal solutions (POS) in SCN. Furthermore, with the wide application of the internet, an increasing number of SCN applications have been based on the internet. As a result, the complexity of SCN increases exponentially with the number of suppliers increasing. It is really a big challenge to find the global multi-objective POS within a limited time in SCN management. In order to solve this problem, first, this paper proposes an artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization algorithm with two improvements: (1) a novel solution framework designed to extend the application field of the SCN based on complex network; (2) the acceleration of search speed by adopting naive Bayes classifier. Second, the paper provides a case example of optimizing a three-echelon SCN with the objective of minimizing both cost and lead-time. After the simulation with this example, it turns out that the enhanced ABC algorithm can satisfy the requirements of: (1) finding the global multi-objective POS; (2) improving the speed of finding optimal solutions in SCN management. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Some authors investigated sustainable natural resource management based on large scale data, including energy, generation and agricultural land. Some authors studied green innovation from various perspectives, and built different models to analyze green growth problems. The findings and recommendations are positive and encouraging. However, it is clear that many additional challenges must be solved in order to establish and support systems which will guide and monitor transformations into sustainable, livable, and low pollution.

In the process of food cold chain quality management systems, it is necessary to accurately detect and identify the quality of food cold chain systems, and the quality management technology of food cold chain systems based on big data analysis is put forward. The statistical analysis model of food cold chain system quality management evaluation is constructed. Through the same kind of mapping and closed frequency complex item collection evaluation method, the hierarchical cluster analysis of data is carried out. The criterion of food cold chain quality management systems can be obtained by the Sigma test. In the statistical regression analysis model, the attribute set of food cold chain quality distribution big data in food cold chain quality management systems is constructed. There are six secondary indexes under the management scale of the enterprise, five secondary indexes under the warehousing management level, four secondary indicators under the logistics level, three information indexes under the information level, and three evaluation indexes under the customer management level. By using this evaluation system, the development status and operation status of fresh cold chain logistics can be reflected comprehensively, and the quality management of food cold chain systems can be determined.

	abstract = {In this work, a multidepot multiperiod vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries (MDPVRPPD) is solved by optimizing logistics networks with collaboration and resource sharing among logistics service providers. The optimal solution can satisfy customer demands with periodic time characteristics and incorporate pickup and delivery services with maximum resource utilization. A collaborative mechanism is developed to rearrange both the open and closed vehicle routes among multiple pickup and delivery centers with improved transportation efficiency and reduced operational costs. The effects of resource sharing strategies combining customer information sharing, facility service sharing, and vehicle sharing are investigated across multiple service periods to maximize resource utilization and refine the resource configuration. A multiobjective optimization model is developed to formulate the MDPVRPPD so that the minimum total operational costs, waiting time, and the number of vehicles are obtained. A hybrid heuristic algorithm incorporating a 3D clustering and an improved multiobjective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO) algorithm is introduced to solve the MDPVRPPD and find Pareto optimal solutions. The proposed hybrid heuristic algorithm is based on a selective exchange mechanism that enhances local and global searching capabilities. Results demonstrate that the proposed IMOPSO outperforms other existing algorithms. We also study profit allocation issues to quantify the stability and sustainability of long-term collaboration among logistics participants, using the minimum costs remaining savings method. The proposed model and solution methods are validated by conducting an empirical study of a real system in Chongqing City, China. This study contributes to the development of efficient urban logistics distribution systems, and facilitates the expansion of intelligent and sustainable supply chains. © 2020 by the authors.},

In recent years, the Internet of things (IoT) has connected billions of devices around the world to collect and share data on product and process performance, physical surroundings, and usage patterns. These IoT-based smart objects have a profound impact on three core business processes: product lifecycle management (PLM), supply chain management (SCM), and customer relationship management (CRM). Drawing on the theories in the fields of ICT-led electronic markets and IoT applications, this paper shows how IoT can transform the next generation of electronic markets by making them more transparent, collaborative, and automated. The paper contributes to the theory of the electronic markets by showing how the IoT can extend the product life cycle management beyond the firm's boundaries, enable live tracking of the product in upward and downward supply chains, and provide proactive customer relationship management (CRM) services. The challenges faced by electronic markets during such transformation are also discussed. © 2020 Issues in Information Systems. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Current chemical industry is heavily reliant on fossil resources as feedstock, resulting in a linear economical model, namely extract-make-use-dispose. In contrast, circular economy, targeting a more sustainable use of materials, aims to construct a loop in which waste is repurposed as feedstock. Circular economy in chemical industry may be achieved by integrating bio-waste into the chemical supply chain. However, bio-waste is different in many ways compared with fossil fuels, such as sparse distribution, geographical diversity, season-dependent supply, variability and complex composition. This short review highlights recent technological advances in valorization of bio-waste including new processing methods and promissing products. Analysis into the specific features of bio-waste suggests that bio-waste could be a promising feedstock for hub and fine chemicals, but not the commodity chemicals. A logic model of bio-waste based circular economy is proposed. Application of data mining and automated chemical routes are envisaged. © 2019},

In particular, destination network metrics (i.e., density, in-degree centralization, out-degree centralization, betweenness centralization, and global clustering coefficient) for 29 Florida counties were derived from 4.3 million geotagged photos found on the photo sharing service Flickr and then correlated with visitor-related spending reported by the Florida Department of Revenue. The results of regression analyses indicate that density, out-degree centralization, and in-degree centralization are negatively correlated with total visitor-related spending within a destination, while betweenness centralization is found to have a positive relationship. Based on these findings, it is concluded that the economic value generated by tourism is constrained by the destination network structure of supply-side and demand-side interactions. Further, it is argued that a “network orchestrator” approach to management can be used to better manage economic impacts within a destination. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Organizations usually confront with disruptive incidents which have widespread negative effects on their performance. The ability of an organization to reduce the losses caused by these incidents is referred to economic resilience. Economic resilience is a concept that can improve the performance of an organization during crises. Petrochemical industry is a strategic industry. Any interruption in its operation can result in enormous cost and environmental hazards. Therefore, it is important to make it resilient against incidents to ensure sustainability objectives. In this research, the performance of a petrochemical plant is investigated in case of a crisis. At first, based on a comprehensive literature review, a conceptual framework for organizational economic resilience is developed. A structured questionnaire is provided and distributed among the staff of a petrochemical plant as a real case study. Then, due to the uncertain nature of incidents, three uncertain Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models are employed to identify the efficient units of the petrochemical plant. At the end, a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the importance of each factor in building economic resilience in the plant. Results show that preparedness and planning, properties and resourcefulness, and collateral pathways and redundancy are the most important economic resilient factors for this specific petrochemical plant. This is the first study that presents an integrated qualitative-quantitative approach including a conceptual framework for economic resilience and a DEA model in uncertain conditions in the whole supply chain of a petrochemical plant. This proposed approach can be used for all types of industrial organizations to improve their performance during the crisis. The proposed approach can help managers to understand the situation of their organization with respect to the economic resilience factors, comprehensively. Furthermore, the results help managers to strengthen their potential economic resilience against the crisis for sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Sustainability of food consumption requires the understanding of multi-dimensional environmental, economic and social impacts using a holistic and integrated sustainability assessment and modeling framework. This article presents a novel method on the assessment and modeling of sustainability impacts of food consumption. First, sustainability impacts of food consumption categories are quantified using high sector resolution input-output tables of U.S. economy. Later, an integrated sustainability modeling framework based on two supervised machine-learning techniques such as k-means clustering and logistics regression is presented. The proposed framework involves five steps: (1) economic input-output life cycle sustainability assessment, (2) non-dimensional normalization, (3) sustainability performance evaluation, (4) centroid-based clustering analysis, and (5) sustainability impact modeling. The findings show that the supply chains of food production sectors are accounted for major environmental impacts with higher than 80% of portions for total carbon footprints. Animal slaughtering, rendering, and processing is found as the most dominant sector in most of the environmental impact categories. The logistic model results revealed an overall model accuracy equal to 91.67%. Furthermore, among all the environmental sustainability indicators, it has found that CO and SO2 are the most significant contributors. The results also show that 13.7% of the food and beverage sectors are clustered as high, in which the bread and bakery product manufacturing is the central sector. The large value of the variance (5.24) is attributed to the large total weighted impact value of the animal (except poultry) slaughtering, rendering, and processing cluster. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In the first phase, we select the depots to be opened, allocate the customers to open depots using a Hierarchical Ascendant (HA) method and we solve the vehicle routing problem for each depot using Sweep algorithm. In the second phase, we apply a Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) with three structures in order to optimize the cost obtained by the first phase. Two sets of well-known instances from the literature are used to evaluate the performance of this method, and the numerical results obtained are compared with the experimental results of other methods.

	abstract = {Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been extensively used because of their lower nonrecurring engineering and design costs, instant availability and reduced visibility of failure, high performance, and power benefits. Reports indicate that previously used or recycled FPGAs are infiltrating the electronics' supply chain and making the security and reliability of the critical systems and networks vulnerable. Current recycled integrated circuit (IC) detection procedures include parametric, functional, and burn-in tests that require golden or reference data. Besides, they are time consuming, require expensive equipment, and do not focus on FPGAs. In this article, we propose two recycled FPGA detection methods based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. We develop a sophisticated ring oscillator (RO) design to exploit the degradation of lookup tables (LUTs) and use them in the proposed methods. In the supervised method, a one-class classifier is trained with RO frequencies, kurtosis, and skewness data obtained from unused FPGAs, which differentiates unused and aged FPGAs. The unsupervised method uses $k$-means clustering and Silhouette value analysis to detect suspect recycled components with very little (if any) golden information. In addition, we introduce a voltage scaling-assisted RO frequency measurement technique that improves the classification. The proposed methods are examined for Spartan-3A and Spartan-6 FPGAs, and the result shows that both methods are effective in detecting recycled FPGAs, which experience accelerated aging for at least 12 h equivalent to 70 days in real-time age. © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

Being one of the key stakeholders, the international maritime industry plays an important role in contributing to global sustainability. By applying the concept of social entrepreneurship (SE), this study aims to examine (1) the basic and extended responsibilities (SDG 1–SDG 16) and (2) the potential collaborations within the value chain (SDG 17) concerning SDG implementation in maritime industry. To achieve these, we conduct a content analysis of sustainability reports published by container shipping liners and terminal operators from 2016 to 2019. More specifically, manual text classification is adopted to categorise the text content of sustainability reports based on 17 SDGs, and automatic text mining is employed to further identify the key roles of maritime industry related to each SDG. A unified framework is proposed, which points to varied motives and levels of comprehensiveness of the sustainability efforts by the maritime industry. This framework reveals the theoretic process of maritime industry's transitional involvement in sustainability from the SE perspective. It also creates managerial implications regarding the resource allocation strategies by maritime industry in meeting SDGs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Specifically, whether there exists an optimal level of inventory that maximizes sales performance is investigated. In order to better understand the effect of supply chain inventories on firm performance, three types of inventories: raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods are separately considered. Analyzing the panel data set of 272 Korean manufacturing firms for the period 1996 to 2012, the following conclusions based on regression methodology has been drawn. After controlling for previous inventory, we find there exists an optimal level of current inventory that maximizes current firm profitability. Furthermore, it is examined whether the external competition level is high using clustering analysis. We find that the effects of supply chain inventories on performance are influenced by the competitive intensity of an industry. The results suggest that while all types of inventories show the non-linear effects on firm performance in the highly competitive market, only finished goods inventory shows significant effects on firm performance in the low competitive market. Our study provides empirical supports for how each type of inventories should be managed and contributes to the extant literature by suggesting managerial implications from a supply-chain perspective perspective for practical engineers and technical professionals. © 2020, © 2020 American Society for Engineering Management.},

The importance of digital text data in the food and nutrition has only recently gained attention due to advancements in big data analytics. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the data sources, computational methods, and applications of text data in the food industry. Text mining techniques such as word-level analysis (e.g., frequency analysis), word association analysis (e.g., network analysis), and advanced techniques (e.g., text classification, text clustering, topic modeling, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis) will be discussed. Applications of text data analysis will be illustrated with respect to food safety and food fraud surveillance, dietary pattern characterization, consumer-opinion mining, new-product development, food knowledge discovery, food supply-chain management, and online food services.

After nearly 30 years’ development, a general cartography of existing research is now needed to reflect the major ideas and questions involved. This is carried out here by a bibliometric analysis. Following a basic review of the evolutionary progress of “green manufacturing” and similar concepts, we collect articles concerning green manufacturing, environmentally conscious/responsible manufacturing, benign manufacturing, and sustainable manufacturing. The data sources are limited to SCI and SSCI journals. Then we extract high frequency keywords from the articles and calculate their co-occurrence. A hierarchical clustering is conducted based on the co-word matrix, and six clusters are identified and visually presented by a strategic diagram and bi-dimensional multi-dimensional scaling diagrams. The six clusters cover the research subjects of green chemical materials, green manufacturing principles and approaches, common analytical tools, green manufacturing implementation of industrial firms, green supply chain, industrial ecology, GHG emissions, and green machining tools and processes. We build a framework to embed the green manufacturing system into the economic-social-eco system and divide green manufacturing research into three levels: application, organization, and system. Based on this framework, we combine the existing research architecture and research boundaries in the field and propose possible future research directions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The correlated storage assignment can reduce a significant amount of travel costs, but could lead to traffic congestion due to the imbalanced traffic flow. Hence, this research proposes the correlated and traffic balanced storage assignment (C&TBSA) to minimize the travel time and picking delays, which is modeled in two stages: clustering and assignment. In the clustering stage, a bi-objective optimization model is formulated to group items with the consideration of both travel efficiency and traffic flow balance, which is solved using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). In the assignment stage, items in each cluster are distributed to the available storage locations. C&TBSA is evaluated with an actual warehouse case study and the results show that C&TBSA outperforms random, class-based, and correlated storage assignment methods by 48.74%, 23.82%, and 7.58% respectively, regarding the total time consisting of travel time and picking delays. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Well-executed case-based research will always be an appropriate means for developing supply chain theory. However, this EDI seeks to highlight emerging approaches to theory building that provide alternatives to case-based research or can be used as a source of triangulation with it. To start that discourse, this issue offers three emergent approaches. In “Theorizing Supply Chains with Qualitative Big Data and Topic Modeling,” Tima Bansal, Jury Gualandris, and Nahyun Kim explore the application of topic modeling to develop supply chain theory from qualitative textual big data evidence. Anne Touboulic, Lucy McCarthy, and Lee Matthews illustrate the use of critical engaged research to develop supply chain theory in “Re-Imagining Supply Chain Challenges Through Critical Engaged Research.” In “A New Methodology for Supply Chain Management: Discourse Analysis and its Potential for Theoretical Advancement,” Cynthia Hardy, Vikram Bhakoo, and Steve Maguire describe the potential for discourse analysis for developing supply chain management theory. These are but a few examples of potential approaches to developing supply chain theory. We welcome submissions on additional approaches and sources of data that are used in other disciplines, but have yet to be applied in the context of developing supply chain theory, and submissions on approaches that are emergent in the social sciences, in general.

Recently, it has also been introduced in food science and engineering. To our knowledge, this review is the first in the food domain. In this paper, we provided a brief introduction of deep learning and detailedly described the structure of some popular architectures of deep neural networks and the approaches for training a model. We surveyed dozens of articles that used deep learning as the data analysis tool to solve the problems and challenges in food domain, including food recognition, calories estimation, quality detection of fruits, vegetables, meat and aquatic products, food supply chain, and food contamination. The specific problems, the datasets, the preprocessing methods, the networks and frameworks used, the performance achieved, and the comparison with other popular solutions of each research were investigated. We also analyzed the potential of deep learning to be used as an advanced data mining tool in food sensory and consume researches. The result of our survey indicates that deep learning outperforms other methods such as manual feature extractors, conventional machine learning algorithms, and deep learning as a promising tool in food quality and safety inspection. The encouraging results in classification and regression problems achieved by deep learning will attract more research efforts to apply deep learning into the field of food in the future. © 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®},

Topic modeling identifies co-occurring words in qualitative Big Data, which can reveal new constructs that are difficult to see in such volume of data. Analyzing the relationships among constructs or their descriptive content can help to understand and explain how supply chains emerge, function, and adapt over time. As topic modeling has not yet been used to theorize supply chains, we illustrate the use of this method and its relevance for future research by unpacking two papers published in organizational theory journals. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Design/methodology/approach: Data mining-based social network analysis was used to investigate the pattern of discussions regarding apparel supply chain transparency on Twitter and Instagram. Findings: Both Instagram and Twitter networks exhibited high interest in environmental, working condition and community support in apparel supply chain as explained by the moral responsibility framework of corporate sustainability despite the intended theme of the campaign to promote transparency in terms of working conditions specifically. However, some inconsistencies were found regarding the importance of these communities in the network, suggesting that while survey methods hold significance in measuring user intension, the reaction-based user-generated data on social media can be useful to measure users' true behavior. Also, while Twitter network was dominated by knowledge-based messages, the Instagram network had emotion-driven messages. Originality/value: By conducting this study, the authors will not only contribute to the existing literature of social media usage in the apparel industry but will also provide a foundation for the use of social network analysis to analyze user-generated data on social media, as this method is fairly new in the textile and apparel industry-related research. The authors also wish to help businesses and policy makers identify specific actionable areas where they are lagging and hence further improve their overall performance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm that connects various physical sensor devices spread across different locations. IoT-enabled supply chain provides a natural combination to achieve supply chain visibility (SCV) which refers to ability of supply chain partners to collect and analyse distributed supply chain data for the planning and decision support. This data is normally collected and analysed in real-time by a specialized software known as Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines. However, current CEP engines have two well-known limitations. Firstly, current CEP engines are job specific and fail to combine multiple related sensor data streams coming from distributed sources, thereby, supply chain partners are exposed to manage the underlying information heterogeneity. Secondly, these CEP systems do not provide decision support to the supply chain planners when the information about the potential disruptive event is incomplete and/or uncertain. In this paper, a PERCEPTUS framework is proposed to address the above mentioned issues. It, firstly, utilizes semantic annotation process to integrate and annotate events coming from heterogeneous data streams. Secondly, it performs complex event processing to process and correctly interpret annotated complex events. Thirdly, it provides complex event reasoning (by combining logical and probabilistic reasoning) to predict disruption events (such as process failure) under incomplete and/or uncertain information. Finally, the proposed framework is validated using the dataset of a semi-conductor manufacturing process to demonstrate its superiority in terms of accuracy in predicting disruptive events as compared to the baseline approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Due to this kind of demand, healthcare supply chains (SC) need to keep high inventory levels to ensure high availability of medicines to save people's lives. We develop a method that effectively utilises the data mining concepts as well as gravitational search algorithm (GSA) for optimal inventory control. The proposed method consists of two key functions, mining association rules for inventory and choosing SC cost-impact rules. Initially, the association rules are mined from EMA-based healthcare inventory data. After that, SC cost-impact rules are chosen for every SC member using GSA. The obtained SC cost-impact rules will possibly signify the future state of inventory in any SC member. Furthermore, the level of holding or reducing the inventory can be determined from the SC cost-impact rules. Thus, the SC cost-impact rules that are derived using the proposed method greatly facilitate optimal inventory control and hence make the supply chain management more effective.

	abstract = {Over the course of just a few years, shrimp farming has become a major aquaculture production system in coastal areas of several developing countries across the globe. However, farmers are facing a variety of risks related to disease, market, and climate, which influence risk management strategies and adoption of new technologies. This paper looks at three practices related to pond management: (1) water quality management to ensure a good environment for shrimp growth; (2) adequate feed input; and (3) disease control practices in order to mitigate the risk of disease outbreak in the pond. We investigated adoption of these three practices in smallholder shrimp farms in the Mekong Delta, by exploring how and whether membership into a producer's cluster influences access to knowledge and perception of risk in the adoption process. The results show that, after controlling for farm characteristics, farm clustering has a positive relationship with the adoption of water quality management, feed inputs, and disease control practices. Results also indicate that increasing interaction frequency with public sector and private sector's actors, as well as the perceived degree of market risk, positively influences the adoption of the three pond management practices under study. Mediation analyses show that being a member of a farmer cluster influences adoption of farming practices via two underlying processes: frequency of interaction with public and private sector's actors, and perception of market risk, both of which ultimately promote the adoption of practices. We conclude that clustering is a promising avenue for fostering interactions between farmers and key supporting actors in aquaculture, and impacts both the formation of specific aqua-related risk perceptions and subsequent practice adoption. As such, clusters – by fostering linkages and facilitating interactions between different knowledge sources – can promote adoption of practices toward sustainable intensification. However, to more effectively deploy a cluster approach a key policy and practice implication is to take into consideration local idiosyncrasies defined by their social interactions, risk perception and spatial dimensions in order to better facilitate local linkages between farms (horizontal coordination) and a better integration with the value chain (vertical coordination). © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Nowadays, meeting the customer's demands in the shortest time and least cost is the most challenging task of maintaining any supply chain. Vehicle routing problem (VRP) plays an important role in the logistics. In typical VRP, customers' are used to serving as a single depot, but in real-life single depot will not be sufficient to meet the customer's demand or customers' satisfaction. In this context, this article presents the multi-depot vehicle routing problem based on customer's satisfaction (MDVRPCS). Since MDVRPCS is an NP-hard problem so, ant colony optimisation (ACO) has been proposed to solve the MDVRPCS. The proposed algorithms have two phases. The first phase involves clustering the nodes into a desired number of groups. This has been done by using K-means clustering algorithm. The second phase involves optimisation of routes for each cluster. This is achieved by using ACO. The proposed algorithm has been tested for well-know problem instances from the literature. The results show that the algorithm is capable of obtaining good optimal solutions. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

We demonstrate the usability of the proposed method in detecting future worldviews of experts grouped by their position in the value chain. The results show polarized responses, with considerable clustering among groups. For example, respondents who were inclined to view digital technologies as disruptive (i.e., as changing the paradigm of value creation in machine-building) also viewed them as related more to service and business models than to products and operation.

	abstract = {Purpose of the paper: The paper explores use of big data in innovation and market leadership in B2B relationships. It provides a framework to analyze the impact of big data, supported by four case studies. Methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper, supported by case studies, offering the opportunity for concept generalization. The case study organizations are innovating to stay ahead in the market and to expand activity, using big data to exploit marketing opportunities and create new offerings. Findings: Organizations are recipients of and are collectors of big data, partly created by the increasing volume of business and customer transactions online. The qualitative exploration of the cases shows that big data and its analytics and applications can be taken as indicators of organizations’ ability to innovate to respond to market opportunities. Research limitations/implications: The online marketing environment is a dynamic one, where organizations must innovate to survive. A limitation is that the cases in the paper do not deal with those lagging in innovation, for whom survival is an issue. The paper’s examples are limited to successful organizations where big data, data mining and analytics led to strategic business success. Practical Implications: B2B organizations that operate in markets where their own products or services have a significant impact on how the products and services of their B2B customers provide value to end (B2C) customers should, in their innovation activity, engage fully with the end B2C market, together with their B2B customers. This has implications in every area from strategy to human resources. If the B2B organization’s pedigree includes B2C activity parallel to that of their customers but not competitive, this can give them an advantage in marketing, but if their B2C activities start to encroach on the B2C activities of their customers, this may cause conflict and loss of business. This implies that if marketing strategy becomes siloed between the different branches of the business, the potential for conflict increases. Originality/value of the paper: The paper’s value is in contributing to understanding big data’s role in business innovation, specifically in business to business organizations and where their innovation can transform customer experience at the end of the value chain, i.e., with final consumers. Therefore, the paper helps to address a research gap in the literature, which tends to focus on how such innovation affects business-to-business relationships. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The capacitated p-median transportation inventory problem with heterogeneous fleet (CLITraP-HTF) aims to determine an optimal solution to a transportation problem subject to location-allocation, inventory management and transportation decisions. The novelty of CLITraP-HTF is to design a supply chain that solves all these decisions at the same time. Optimizing the CLITraP-HTF is a challenge because of the high dimension of the decision variables that lead to a large and complex search space. The contribution of this paper is to develop a dimensionality-reduction procedure (DRP) to reduce the CLITraP-HTF complexity and help to solve it. The proposed DRP is a mathematical proof to demonstrate that the inventory management and transportation decisions can be solved before the optimization procedure, thus reducing the complexity of the CLITraP-HTF by greatly narrowing its number of decision variables such that the remaining problem to solve is the well-known capacitated p-median problem (CPMP). The conclusion is that the proposed DRP helps to solve the CLITraP-HTF because the CPMP can be and has been solved by applying different algorithms and heuristic methods. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {On the request of decision-makers, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)framework is increasingly applied in agri-food value chains in developing countries under particularly demanding constraints. Based on the cradle-to-farm-gate LCA results of the tomato in Rwamagana district in Rwanda commissioned by the European Union, the main objectives of the paper were to validate statistically the differences in environmental impacts among expert-based types for this crop based on location and season and identify the key-drivers of these impacts. The study was developed thanks to two intensive field visits and a survey of 15 plots. The functional unit was one kg of tomato at farm-gate. Combining several statistical analyses allowed identifying three groups of plots with contrasting input profile and eco-efficiency. For most impact categories, the first group with mainly plots in marshland during wet season had the lowest impacts and the third group with plots in hillside showed the highest impacts. The yield of tomato being significantly different between marshland and hillside plots was an important driver of these results. The second group composed of plots in marshland during the dry season generally showed intermediate impacts due to the withdrawing of water for irrigation. The second group obtained a higher freshwater ecotoxicity due to a more intensive use of toxic insecticides. The factorial analysis for mixed data (FAMD)confirmed the importance of the location and the season for the eco-efficiency of tomato plots and the hierarchical clustering on principle components (HCPC)separated the tomato plots into three clusters. The generalized linear models (GLMs)validated the differences in the environmental impacts per kg of tomato between the clusters. The principal component analysis (PCA)combined to GLM revealed that only the use of water was significantly different between the three groups. Compared to existing datasets, all groups showed high freshwater ecotoxicity impacts due to the use of toxic insecticides and the excessive use of mancozeb. The third group also showed a high freshwater eutrophication in relation to P losses due to erosion and low yield. From a methodological point of view, we demonstrated in this paper that using expert-based typologies combined with adapted statistical analyses constituted a relevant approach under such circumstances. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: The increased variability in production or procurement with respect to less increase of variability in demand or sales is considered as bullwhip effect. Bullwhip effect is considered as an encumbrance in optimization of supply chain as it causes inadequacy in the supply chain. Various operations and supply chain management consultants, managers and researchers are doing a rigorous study to find the causes behind the dynamic nature of the supply chain management and have listed shorter product life cycle, change in technology, change in consumer preference and era of globalization, to name a few. Most of the literature that explored bullwhip effect is found to be based on simulations and mathematical models. Exploring bullwhip effect using machine learning is the novel approach of the present study. Methods: Present study explores the operational and financial variables affecting the bullwhip effect on the basis of secondary data. Data mining and machine learning techniques are used to explore the variables affecting bullwhip effect in Indian sectors. Rapid Miner tool has been used for data mining and 10-fold cross validation has been performed. Weka Alternating Decision Tree (w-ADT) has been built for decision makers to mitigate bullwhip effect after the classification. Results: Out of the 19 selected variables affecting bullwhip effect 7 variables have been selected which have highest accuracy level with minimum deviation. Conclusion: Classification technique using machine learning provides an effective tool and techniques to explore bullwhip effect in supply chain management. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {In developing economies agriculture and farming play crucial roles for economic sustainable development. Farmer credit risk evaluation is an important issue when determining financial support to farmers, improving agricultural supply chain performance, and ensuring profitability of financial institutions. Credit risk evaluation, or creditworthiness, is not a trivial exercise due to various complexities. Honoring complexity is necessary to effectively evaluate and predict farmer creditworthiness. A methodology using fuzzy rough-set theory and fuzzy C-means clustering is used to evaluate and investigate the complex relationships between farmer characteristics, competitive environmental factors, and farmer credit level. The methodology is detailed using actual bank data from 2044 farmers within China. This empirical methodology generates decision rules that provide insight to more complex relationships than can be found through standard econometric multivariate approaches. A rule-based methodological outcome can be used to predict the creditworthiness of farmers and to aid in agricultural loan decision making. Prediction accuracy of the rule-base was 81.16%. A central finding is that education and skills related characteristics are important for determining farmer credit-worthiness. Other implications are presented along with study limitations and future research directions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to address the potential impacts of Industry 4.0 on human resource management (HRM) – with a particular focus on employment, job profile and qualification and skill requirements in the workforce – which can have implications for supply chain management (SCM). Consequently, exploratory relationships among Industry 4.0, HRM and SCM are presented based on a systematic review. Design/methodology/approach: To explore Industry 4.0 literature and its impact on employment, the authors used a systematic literature review to identify, classify and analyze current knowledge, flagging trends and proposing recommendations for future research in this area. Using the Web of Science database, the authors utilized co-citation software to visualize the networks which emerged from recurrent terms and which were then used to develop the categories of analysis. Findings: The authors can affirm that the literature in this field is in a transition process, from the early studies of German academics to the current development of new impacts worldwide. Industry 4.0 is the central theme of the literature analyzed and is accomplished through the development of employment, qualifications, skills and learning frameworks. The results reveal that most papers are conceptual, with quantitative studies still lacking. Developed countries have a leading role in terms of research production, while Latin America and Asia are far behind. Clustering reveals four dominant themes (educational changes, employment scenario, work infrastructure resources and work meaning and proposal). The first refers to labor changes around working conditions, the work environment and new skills which are required. The second main theme concerns the potentially unstable shift in the labor market has toward a high-level context. The third is about the technical interface of humans and machines, and finally, the fourth understands the German industry as a starting point for global industrial improvements and work proposal changes. Furthermore, socio-technical systems cover the implications of HRM for SCM in three different dimensions: qualification and education (human competences), collaboration and integration of SCM (organizational competences) and data and information management (technical competences). Research limitations/implications: An original research agenda for further development of the topic. Additionally, the implications of the findings for SCM practitioners are presented. Practical implications: SCM managers can benefit from the results of this paper by developing adjusted polices for organizational and human aspects. Specially about training programs to improve technology skills and education programs for cyber-human new plataforms. Originality/value: So far, Industry 4.0, HRM-related topics and implications for SCM have generally been considered separately. This paper elucidates the few important studies on the impacts of Industry 4.0 on human-related topics, such as the labor market, building a research framework using the main contributions highlighted in the literature. An original research agenda is presented, as well as potential implications for SCM. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Hatcheries have the power to spread antimicrobial resistant (AMR) pathogens through the poultry value chain because of their central position in the poultry production chain. Currently, no information is available about the presence of AMR Escherichia coli strains and the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) they harbor within hatchezries. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the possible involvement of hatcheries in harboring hemolytic AMR E. coli. Serotyping of the 65 isolated hemolytic E. coli revealed 15 serotypes with the ability to produce moderate biofilms, and shared susceptibility to cephradine and fosfomycin and resistance to spectinomycin. The most common β-lactam resistance gene was bla TEM, followed by bla OXA-1, bla MOX-like, bla CIT-like, bla SHV and bla FOX. Hierarchical clustering of E. coli isolates based on their phenotypic and genotypic profiles revealed separation of the majority of isolates from hatchlings and the hatchery environments, suggesting that hatchling and environmental isolates may have different origins. The high frequency of β-lactam resistance genes in AMR E. coli from chick hatchlings indicates that hatcheries may be a reservoir of AMR E. coli and can be a major contributor to the increased environmental burden of ARGs posing an eminent threat to poultry and human health. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In today’s consumer lifestyle, food habits have become an important part to dictate health of the individuals. Natural food like fruits and vegetables supplement most of the need for this healthy lifestyle; however the consumer does not often have access to the right quality of fruits and/or vegetables. Apart from increasing the shelf life, identifying the right time to harvest fruits depending on their maturity helps fruit marketability with better taste levels of the fruit. Current methods of grading fruits based on maturity are mostly by visual inspection of physical characteristics like colour, size and shape and using traditional image processing methods for classification. This proposed study is aimed at analysing multiple significant maturity indices like colour, ultra-structural changes in texture of the fruit to measure precisely the shelf life, optimum harvest time and develop a framework based on deep learning techniques for feature extraction and classification of fruits. Low cost standalone farm management solutions can be built using this concept that will help multiple stakeholders in the fruit supply chain in improved quality control, grading and classification of fruits. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

	abstract = {Supplier development contributes to supply chain integration and performance, thus playing an essential role in any industry. In the retail market, no formal procedures exist for the selection-assignment of supplier development programs, meaning that respective management is complex and unclear given actor and requirement heterogeneities. Multi-criteria techniques are currently used for selection and evaluation processes. However, no models exist that integrate clustering and multi-criteria techniques together to efficiently select-assign supplier development programs. This study proposes a four-phase methodology - diagnosis, program design, assignment, and proposal - that considers supplier clustering through K-means and multi-criteria fuzzification. Additionally, case-study analysis of 149 retail suppliers in Colombia clustered businesses into high (8), medium (32), and low (109) risk sets, each of which was assigned tailored development programs. The obtained results support use of the proposed methodology to improve supply chain performance for organisations with many suppliers requiring development programs.

This study is focused on the level of investment and collaboration decisions pertaining to emission reduction. Design/methodology/approach: The authors’ model includes a fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm and a fuzzy formal concept analysis. First, a set of suppliers were classified according to their carbon performances through the FCM clustering algorithm. Then, the fuzzy formal concepts were derived from a set of fuzzy formal contexts through an intersection-based method. These fuzzy formal concepts provide the relative level of investments and collaboration decisions for each identified supplier cluster. A case from the Indian renewable energy sector was used for illustration of the proposed analytical model. Findings: The proposed model and case illustration may help manufacturing firms to collaborate with their suppliers for improving their carbon performances. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the low carbon supply chain management literature by identifying the decision criteria of investments toward low carbon supplier development. It also provides an analytical model of collaboration for low carbon supplier development.

	abstract = {As an essential component of a supply chain, warehousing with a high operational management level can significantly enhance the efficiency of manufacturing. Practically, there are many exceptional events (EEs) that impede agile operation in warehousing, and disparate handling processes should be established according to the characteristics of the EEs. In this context, a classification methodology for the EEs based on a generalised criterion with mixed-valued attributes is presented in this study. The approaches for determining the initial clustering centres for a dataset with mixed-valued attributes are illustrated in accordance with the distribution regularities of values of numerical and categorical attributes. Subsequently, two algorithms without randomisation of the initial clustering centres are successively generated: one is a basic iterative algorithm and the other is an algorithm that can optimise the number of clusters automatically. The classification of EEs in warehousing by utilising the proposed algorithm is established as a case study in the storage department of an electric tool enterprise. Finally, the applicability of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing with k-prototypes and the original algorithm, and a processing flow is proposed for EEs in warehousing based on the final clustering results. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The retailers are allocated to serve a cluster of consumers. This study demonstrates economic and environment benefits that are achieved in terms of reduced delivery time, transportation cost and carbon emissions. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on modeling the outbound logistics of a retail chain by using Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM). KSOM is an unsupervised learning and data analysis method for vector quantization, which is based on Euclidean distance method to form clusters. Findings: Appropriate clustering of retailers and consumers provides efficient locations of retailers that are identified using the KSOM training algorithm. It provides optimum distance with lesser delivery time, transportation cost and carbon emissions. Research limitations/implications: The implication of research includes modeling of operational procedures in a retail supply chain, which is a crucial task for a business. These operations positively affect the reduction in inventory and distribution costs, improvement in customer service and responsiveness to the ever-changing markets of consumer durables. Overall results are insightful and practical in the sense that implementation would result in consumer convenience, eco-friendly environment, etc. Originality/value: There is not enough research available on outbound retail logistics considering retailers and consumers using clustering approach. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The major research questions are: what is an average turning point in terms of per capita GDP in regaining domestic value added share to exports, and which industries, the export industry or supporting industries, have contributed to regaining domestic value added share to exports. The empirical analyses identified an accurate turning point at 2,032 US dollars as per capita GDP in regaining domestic value added share to exports, and also showed that the supporting industries including service sector, rather than the exporting industry itself, have played an active role to push up the domestic value added share to exports in the involvement process of global value chains. The two strategies, “enterprise clustering” and “linkages development”, facilitating technological transfers from international firms to local ones, contributed to the domestic value creation in the involvement process of global value chains. © 2019 AESS Publications.

Mathematical and statistical methods were used (methods of dimension reduction and generalized linear model) to analyze and to evaluate the importance of a strategic situation analysis, including managerial methods, in the process of generation of a corporate strategy in comparison with a corporate value potential, and to identify impact on their competitiveness and sustainability in the current market environment. The decisive activities for manufacturing and industrial enterprises include scientific and technical development and input logistics; in the services sector, the decisive activities are marketing, management of material and after-sale servicing. Profitability and competitiveness in the primary sector are most significantly influenced by output logistics and services.

Design/methodology/approach: Multi-method approach was employed as primary data were collected from a case study of Shaoxing textile cluster, and was supplemented with secondary data to triangulate the findings. The proposition that competitive advantages of industrial clusters facilitate effective SCM was explored. Findings: The authors reveal that China’s cost advantage is manifested in the entire value chain. The provision of business friendly amenities as a result of synergetic benefits of vertical and horizontal integration of supply clusters promotes competitiveness of SMEs and region as a whole. Moreover, specialized markets and international traders found to play significant role in sustainable cluster development. Research limitations/implications: As with fieldwork and case studies, generalization should be drawn with care. Systematic synthesis of relevant case studies is recommended. Practical implications: The study endorses the construction of local supply chains and suggests implementation of cluster strategy by focusing on environment-specific execution of triple helix model. Originality/value: The article elaborates the linkages between cluster theory and SCM both within cluster and between interspersed clusters. It also explains how specialized markets and global players are enabling concentrated supply networks.

This cluster is expected to stimulate the relevant Blue Energy sectors under the perspective of smart and sustainable growth. A healthy cluster is based on an efficient cluster policy. The main policy constituents (innovation, legislation and financial frameworks) are discussed taking into account the interrelated characteristics that are expected to specify the commercial development of MRE in the area. Key issues that can contribute to the establishment and acceleration of deployment of the related technological innovation are identified, and existent hindrances and challenges encountered in MRE sector are determined. The importance of solid financing instruments and strong collaborations among interested stakeholders is also highlighted for the viability of the MRE cluster. Finally, as an example of the cluster activities at a national level, the Greek Hub for Blue Energy is introduced.

This review paper categorises supply chain collaboration and identifies different themes in this research field. Articles were collected based on a designed keywords list and specific subject restrictions in citation databases. Text-mining technology and conceptual criteria were used to categorise and screen articles into different categories. Finally, cluster analysis was used to group articles and identify emerging themes. From the year 1999 to 2017, a total of 678 articles regarding supply chain collaboration were found. These were sorted into six categories: levels of collaboration, industries, supply chain stages, company scales, forms/methods of collaboration and typology of article, and into corresponding sub-categories. 380 articles employing modelling approach where collaboration forms the core of analysis were screened for hierarchical cluster analysis, resulting in four clusters: information sharing paradigm, joint decision-making paradigm, resource sharing paradigm and coordinating contract paradigm. Eleven themes were finally identified based on the four clusters. The number of articles in the field of supply chain collaboration shows an increasing trend by year. However, most of the collaborations discussed were still at a low level. It is expected to explore a higher level of collaborations and related themes in future research. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {With power consumption increasing in China, the CO2 emissions from electricity pose a serious threat to the environment. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the influencing factors of power CO2 emissions, which is conducive to sustainable economic development. Taking the characteristics of power generation, transmission and consumption into consideration, the grey relational analysis method (GRA) is adopted to select 11 influencing factors, which are further converted into 5 main factors by hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). According to the possible variation tendency of each factor, 48 development scenarios are set up from 2018-2025, and then an extreme learning machine optimized by whale algorithm based on chaotic sine cosine operator (CSCWOA-ELM) is established to predict the power CO2 emissions respectively. The results show that gross domestic product (GDP) has the greatest impact on the CO2 emissions from power output, of which the average contribution rate is 1.28%. Similarly, power structure and living consumption level also have an enormous influence, with average contribution rates over 0.6%. Eventually, the analysis made in this study can provide valuable policy implications for power CO2 emissions reduction, which can be regarded as a reference for China's 14th Five-Year development plan in the future. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Managing emergency physicians is a complex task and has increasingly intensified with the recent consolidation of many emergency departments (EDs). Large-scale physician groups are facing challenges in resource deployment and performance evaluation. To objectively evaluate physicians across facilities, we leverage big data from an emergency physician management network and propose data-driven metrics using a large-scale database consisting of 84 hospitals, 1,079 physicians, and 10,615,879 patient visits in 14 states over 600,000 clinical shifts from 2010 to 2014. To ensure physicians are fairly evaluated and compensated within diverse facilities, we propose an index system and use clustering to help identify factors which might impact physician performance. The proposed indices benchmark physicians from the perspectives of revenue potential, patient volume, patient complexity, and patient experience by controlling for exogenous factors at the facility level. We empirically show the volume and complexity indices are key elements of the revenue potential index, and use two-stage least squares regression to relate volume and complexity and uncover their drivers. Revenue potential and patient experience are found to be positively correlated, which suggests productive physicians are often liked by their patients. Through implementing the proposed evaluation system, administrators can better manage and incentivize physicians and provide directions for performance improvement, while controlling for location idiosyncrasies. The proposed framework can also be adapted to non-medical professional settings such as value chains, where employees often provide services in various profit- and cost-centers. © 2017 Production and Operations Management Society},

	abstract = {Promotions are a widely used strategy to engage consumers and as such, retailers dedicate immense effort and resources to their planning and forecasting. This paper introduces a novel interpretable machine learning method specifically tailored to the automatic prediction of promotional sales in real-market applications. Particularly, we present fully automated weighted k-nearest neighbors where the distances are calculated based on a feature selection process that focuses on the similarity of promotional sales. The method learns online, thereby avoiding the model being retrained and redeployed. It is robust and able to infer the mechanisms leading to sales as demonstrated on detailed surrogate models. Also, to validate this method, real market data provided by a worldwide retailer have been used, covering numerous categories from three different countries and several types of stores. The algorithm is benchmarked against an ensemble of regression trees and the forecast provided by the retailer and it outperforms both on a merit figure composed not only by the mean absolute error but also by the error deviations used in the retail business. The proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of the forecast in many diverse categories and geographical locations, yielding significant and operative benefits for supply chains. Additionally, we briefly discuss in the Appendix how to deploy our method as a RESTful service in a production environment. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Prefabricated construction (PC) have attracted increasing research attention worldwide due to their advantages such as high construction efficiency, short construction period, low labor cost and low energy consumption. Supply chain management is closely related to the application efficiency of PC, but only in the last three years has this interdisciplinary research received due attention. The global research network in the field of prefabricated construction supply chain management (PCSCM) have not been systematically reviewed so far. Especially in the recent three years, there has been an explosive growth of relevant literature. In this paper, the method of combining scientometrics analysis and thematic discussion was adopted to systematically review 152 important literatures from 2001 to 2018, aiming to provide a holistic understanding of the status in quo, trends and gaps of PCSCM research, and further analyze the prominent problems. The study constructed four kinds of visualized bibliographic information maps for the publication distribution across journals, co-occurrence of keywords, co-authorship analysis, and citation of articles. Then, the four themes summarized by clustering were discussed, mainly focusing on strategic research and project evaluation, PC supply chain process design and optimization, supply chain integration and management, and application of advanced technology. Finally, the research gaps and conceptual development framework to promote PCSCM were reported. This study contributes to grasping the research and development of PCSCM on the whole, and can also serve as an explorative manual to support PCSCM activities and innovative research. © 2019, Success Culture Press.

	abstract = {Purpose: Researchers have been actively investigating various issues concerning food safety and halal food in the supply chain. The ultimate goal is to provide guarantees for quality and conformance regarding food standards and demanding expectation from the consumers. We review a set of two-decade food safety and halal food in supply chain (SC) literature from 1990 to 2018 (month of February) in order to pinpoint the problems, models, solution approaches and more importantly, the future directions of this field. Design/methodology/approach: Our method employs the 120 published articles on food safety and halal food in SC research. Various techniques from statistics, bibliometrics, and analytics are systematically deployed to gain insights on how the literature address these two topics. Findings: The predominant contributing articles, authors, affiliations, and keywords have been reviewed, clustered, and thoroughly analyzed. Through systematic graphical and clustering analyses, four major clusters regarding food safety and two clusters in halal food in SC research have been identified as the most promising and potential future for research opportunities. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on articles that discuss food safety and halal. Practical implications: Our findings provide valuable insights to understand the major clusters of the research endeavour along with the plausible pathways to where they would likely develop in the future. With these insights, researchers and practitioners shall be able to devise initiatives that are of high relevance and significance in the near future. Social implications: This research provides an understanding to the reader about the relationship between food safety and halal. Originality/value: This paper provides the first systematic overview of food safety and halal food for supply chain researchers to see the big picture of the field. Serving as the thread connecting research endeavour in these two research areas, our novel work highlights how the work is connected, which research clusters have been the center-of-attention during the last two decades, and consequently, which areas are still lacking an investigation. We believe that people in both academia and industry who are keen to develop a rigorous solution to ensuring food safety and food halal-ness to satisfy global market requirement will be benefitting the most from our analysis. © 2019, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

In order to adapt to the economic environment, decision-makers across the public and private sectors require accurate forecasts of the economic outlook. Existing predictive frameworks base their forecasts primarily on time series analysis, as well as the judgments of experts. As a consequence, current approaches are often biased and prone to error. In order to reduce forecast errors, this paper presents an innovative methodology that extends lag variables with unstructured data in the form of financial news: (1) we apply a variety of models from machine learning to word counts as a high-dimensional input. However, this approach suffers from low interpretability and overfitting, motivating the following remedies. (2) We follow the intuition that the economic climate is driven by general sentiments and suggest a projection of words onto latent semantic structures as a means of feature engineering. (3) We propose a semantic path model, together with estimation technique based on regularization, in order to yield full interpretability of the forecasts. We demonstrate the predictive performance of our approach by utilizing 80,813 ad hoc announcements in order to make long-term forecasts of up to 24 months ahead regarding key macroeconomic indicators. Back-testing reveals a considerable reduction in forecast errors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Text mining exposed for scrutiny the most frequently mentioned and cited terms contained in the titles, abstracts and keywords of IJPR papers. Analyses suggest that the triad of scheduling/optimisation/simulation and supply-chain-related topics have been IJPR’s mainstays, but valuable opportunities remain for relevant topics that have not yet been concurrently and frequently studied. Results also show that terms related to sustainability and risk management topics have gained recent relevance. In addition, IJPR appears to complement its modelling technique focus with empirical methodological approaches to provide a well-balanced perspective, since the ‘case study’ term is common. Finally, a linear relationship is found between the number of papers that have covered certain topics and the number of citations those topics have received, highlighting which topics had fewer or more citations than expected, given the number of papers that covered those topics.

	abstract = {Clothing production is part of a large chain of businesses, ranging from agribusiness (production of various fibers and cotton) to textiles (spinning, dying), garment making and distribution. Manufacturing of apparel is an essential commercial chain for the developing countries Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Since the clothing industry presents several segments with potential pollution, the consumer vision of sustainability is necessary to promote an essential environmental balance. The present study aimed to evaluate the Brazilian consumer awareness about the impact of clothing production in the environment. An online questionnaire was distributed to an available sample that resulted in 503 responses. Questions were related to the consumers’ lifestyle and consumption. Data were organized in a spreadsheet, and the Ecological Footprint (EF) was estimated. Data mining was applied to model the attributes that influence the EF of consumers, and to classify the consumer Ecological Footprint (Bad, Moderate or Good). After estimating the EF of all responses, we applied the cluster analysis to understand how the consumer's group. The results indicated that women spent more on cotton clothes than men. Most of the respondents (62%) are not aware of the clothing production chain and its potential for pollution. Although the consumers are generally concerned with sustainability (66%), most interviewees are not aware of the manufacturing processes of the worn garments neither the impact the cotton manufacturing might cause to the environment. The studied Brazilian consumers show that, although they wear clothes made of cotton, they are not aware of how the production is. Men do not know and do not care about this fact, as can be observed by the decision tree. Another point was that consumers (65%) seek to buy generic products from sustainable companies, but they do not know if the clothing manufacturer is sustainable. It is also observed that the values spent on clothes do not seem to be related to the Ecological Footprint. For the key questions of the questionnaire, the answers by income bracket were checked to verify the relationship with the lifestyle. We concluded that the Ecological Footprint of the consumers increase as their expenditure are greater also in the lifestyle requirements. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In this paper, complex event processing (CEP) based RFID-enabled retail store management is studied, particularly focusing on automated shelf replenishment decisions. We define different types of event queries to describe retailer store workflow action over the RFID data streams on multiple tagging levels (e.g., item level and container level). Non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) based evaluation models are used to detect event patterns. To manage pattern match results in the process of event detection, optimization algorithm is applied in the event model to share event detection results.

	abstract = {Despite the promise that the technology offers, RFID adoption continues to lag behind initial projections. Industry studies intimate that, in part, this lag is attributable to the RFID performance gap – the difference between desired RFID tag read-rates and those experienced in the field. To explore this phenomena, we employ a mixed research methodology involving intensive case studies of three major retailers as well as large-scale laboratory and field data collection and analysis. Our case studies indicate that major retailers are incurring several operational inefficiencies, including slowed processing times, manual counts to verify inventory levels, and use of “safety factors,” to overcome RFID tag read failures. The practical significance of these findings motivates our subsequent investigation of laboratory test criteria that, when passed, result in RFID tags that perform reliably in the field. To facilitate quantitative analyses, we apply unsupervised learning techniques – i.e., the sequential application of cluster analysis and association rules – to a dataset of 45,416 observations that merge RFID tag laboratory test performance data with read-rate performance data collected from retail supply chains. Our findings identify a pool of RFID tags in which over 99% of the tags have at least a 99% read-rate. Thus, for academics, our study advances a novel unsupervised learning protocol that can be applied to “big data” to gain insights into meaningful supply chain issues, such as RFID tag performance. For practitioners, we establish laboratory test criteria that can be used to identify RFID tags that operate reliably in real-world applications. © 2017 Production and Operations Management Society},

In addition, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) based (PG) algorithm is employed to train RBFnn for function approximation. The proposed mix of SOMnn with PG (MSPG) algorithm combines the automatically clustering ability of SOMnn and the PG algorithm. The simulation results revealed that SOMnn, PSO and GA approaches can be combined ingeniously and redeveloped into a hybrid algorithm which aims for obtaining a more accurate learning performance among relevant algorithms. On the other hand, method evaluation results for four continuous test function experiments and the demand estimation case showed that the MSPG algorithm outperforms other algorithms and the Box–Jenkins models in accuracy. Additionally, the proposed MSPG algorithm is allowed to be embedded into business’ enterprise resource planning system in different industries to provide suppliers, resellers or retailers in the supply chain more accurate demand information for evaluation and so to lower the inventory cost. Next, it can be further applied to the intelligent manufacturing system to cope with real situation in the industry to meet the need of customization. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Starches extracted from acha (Digitaria exilis) and iburu (Digitalia iburua) were subjected to heat moisture treatment and citric acid modification. Successful applications of the treatments are expected to promote commercial utilization of the starches from these underutilized crops and improve the economy and livelihood of stakeholders along their value chains. Granules of the starches from the two cereal grains were polyhedral in shape. Generally, modifications led to the clustering of the polyhedral of the starches granules. Indentations were observed on the surfaces of citric acid modified (CAM) starches. This could be due to the weathering effect of acid hydrolysis. Modification methods employed did not affect the characteristic type-A crystal polymorph of the native starches. The starches generally exhibited single prominent peaks at (2ϴ) 16 and 24, and a doublet at 17-19. Crystallinity index of the starches ranged from 27.01-27.84% for acha and 29.01–30.47% for iburu. FTIR analysis and high peak gelatinization temperatures of the starches suggested heterogeneity in the matrices. CAM starches of the two grains remained in liquid form throughout the pasting cycle. Acha starches are lighter and whiter in color. All the starch samples exhibited promising functional properties that could place them as good materials for different industrial uses. Results of this study further exposed the potentials of acha and iburu starches for food and pharmaceutical applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The area of “opinion mining”, particularly sentiment analysis, aims to find, extract, and systematically analyze people’s opinions, attitudes and emotions towards certain topics. Performance of a supply chain is closely associated with the level of trust, collaboration, and information sharing among its members. In this paper, using textual “sentiment analysis”, we explore the relationship between elements of social media content generated by supply chain members and performance of supply chain. In particular, we identify specific elements of member generated supply chain related content on social media such as: information sharing, collaboration, trust, and commitment to determine their association with supply chain performance. We find information sharing and collaboration to be positively associated with supply chain performance, and these findings are consistent with previous reports in supply chain literature. In addition, ours is one of the first attempts to use sentiment analysis to analyze social media content in a supply chain context. The findings indicate that supply chain members value the sharing of relevant information and collaborative contents on social media as such efforts improve individual and overall supply chain performance. The results of this study should prove useful to other studies that utilize social media in a supply chain context, and to improve supply chain management strategies. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {The application of the 5S methodology to warehouse management represents an important step for all manufacturing companies, especially for managing products that consist of a large number of components. Moreover, from a lean production point of view, inventory management requires a reduction in inventory wastes in terms of costs, quantities and time of non-added value tasks. Moving towards an Industry 4.0 environment, a deeper understanding of data provided by production processes and supply chain operations is needed: the application of Data Mining techniques can provide valuable support in such an objective. In this context, a procedure aiming at reducing the number and the duration of picking processes in an Automated Storage and Retrieval System. Association Rule Mining is applied for reducing time wasted during the storage and retrieval activities of components and finished products, pursuing the space and material management philosophy expressed by the 5S methodology. The first step of the proposed procedure requires the evaluation of the picking frequency for each component. Historical data are analyzed to extract the association rules describing the sets of components frequently belonging to the same order. Then, the allocation of items in the Automated Storage and Retrieval System is performed considering (a) the association degree, i.e., the confidence of the rule, between the components under analysis and (b) the spatial availability. The main contribution of this work is the development of a versatile procedure for eliminating time waste in the picking processes from an AS/RS. A real-life example of a manufacturing company is also presented to explain the proposed procedure, as well as further research development worthy of investigation. © 2019 Polish Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {The safety stock calculation requires a measure of the forecast error uncertainty. Such errors are usually assumed to be Gaussian iid (independently and identically distributed). However, deviations from iid lead to a deterioration in the performance of the supply chain. Recent research has shown that, contrary to theoretical approaches, empirical techniques that do not rely on the aforementioned assumptions can enhance the calculation of safety stocks. In particular, GARCH models cope with time-varying heterocedastic forecast error, and kernel density estimation does not need to rely on a determined distribution. However, if the forecast errors are time-varying heterocedastic and do not follow a determined distribution, the previous approaches are inadequate. We overcome this by proposing an optimal combination of the empirical methods that minimizes the asymmetric piecewise linear loss function, also known as the tick loss. The results show that combining quantile forecasts yields safety stocks with a lower cost. The methodology is illustrated with simulations and real data experiments for different lead times. © 2018 International Institute of Forecasters},

	abstract = {By improving the mining efficiency and enhancing the scalability of the algorithm, it solves the problem that the traditional recommendation algorithm has a long response time and low recommendation efficiency in the recommendation of tourist spots, and cannot adapt to the needs of big data mining. An in-depth analysis of the existing collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm was conducted, and the Slope One algorithm and the Item-based algorithm recommended for the tourist attractions were selected. Combine these two algorithms efficiently, parallelize the algorithm based on MapReduce programming on the Hadoop cloud platform, and verify the validity of the algorithm by collecting the “tourism evaluation network” real tourist attraction scoring data. By testing the real tourist attraction score data, it shows that the algorithm not only improves the accuracy of the recommendation but also has higher running speed than the traditional collaborative filtering algorithm. The experimental results show that the algorithm has higher mining performance and scalability and can be better adapted to the characteristics of large tourist sites, sparse data matrix, and meet the high hit rate and personalized requirements of tourist attractions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Nowadays with the rapid development of technologies, machine vision has been used widely in various industries. The main applications of machine vision in industrial product lines are quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA). The intelligent defects and anomalies recognition throughout the supply chain have come to be an integral part of quality control systems, in particular, in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In these industries, it is a legal requirement in manufacturing processes which can lead to minimizing the total number of defected products as well as maximizing the performance. In this paper, the machine vision has been utilized to monitor and control the proper packaging of drugs in pharmaceutical product lines. The main goal is counting the number of blister cards within a drug package. To tackle this problem, a new model based on object detection, feature extraction, and classification is proposed. Thanks to several strong approaches, such as the Haar cascade, HOG, ORG, Gabor wavelet, Radon transform, KNN, and SVM, and the accuracy over 88% is achieved in our experiments. © 2013 IEEE.},

In order to enhance the logistics service experience of customers and optimize inventory management, e-commerce enterprises focus more on improving the accuracy of sales prediction with machine learning algorithms. In this study, a C-A-XGBoost forecasting model is proposed taking sales features of commodities and tendency of data series into account, based on the XGBoost model. A C-XGBoost model is first established to forecast for each cluster of the resulting clusters based on two-step clustering algorithm, incorporating sales features into the C-XGBoost model as influencing factors of forecasting. Secondly, an A-XGBoost model is used to forecast the tendency with the ARIMA model for the linear part and the XGBoost model for the nonlinear part. The final results are summed by assigning weights to forecasting results of the C-XGBoost and A-XGBoost models. By comparison with the ARIMA, XGBoost, C-XGBoost, and A-XGBoost models using data from Jollychic cross-border e-commerce platform, the C-A-XGBoost is proved to outperform than other four models.

Building resilient supply networks are the possible solutions to reduce, handle, and mitigate the concomitant risks. This research attempts to identify, classify, and measure those barriers in achieving resilience, typically seen in electronic manufacturing supply chains. A methodology incorporating grey clustering algorithm and compromise ranking (VIKOR) methods were used for the classification and measurement of the barriers to supply chain resilience. Managers could perform an initial sorting of the barriers using the grey clustering algorithm to identify those barriers coming under the high importance categories. Then, the VIKOR analysis could be conducted on the selected barriers to effectively prioritize them. The obtained results were subject to sensitivity analysis and were validated using practical case implications. By implementing the proposed methodology for the considered case, the following barriers were identified to be most important; bull whips due to uncertainties in supply, single sourcing, centralization of assets and inability to modify operations in response to challenges. Key managerial implications of the study is that, measuring barriers for reducing supply chain vulnerabilities could lead to better enactment of supply networks with enhanced resilience capabilities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Effective management of biomass supply chain is pivotal to successful deployment of this energy-rich resource in the power sector. Using a case study in Malaysia where biomass feedstock sourcing problem is prevalent, a biomass supply chain system was proposed. Three important terminals were identified, namely; i) biomass supply point (BSP), where raw biomass materials are collected, ii) biomass processing facility (BPF), as the collection hub cum centralized conversion centre, and iii) biomass demand centre (BDC), where the processed biomass meets the end-use sectors. A new modelling approach was proposed to optimize the new BPF location with the objective to minimize total road travelling distance between each terminal. The results were compared with the other commonly used methods, namely centre of gravity and fuzzy clustering. The positive contributions of the proposed model in minimizing the overall logistic cost and CO2 emissions due to fuel consumption were discussed. © 2019, Dorma Journals. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Currently, we can observe that vulnerable web pages are a common element in many high-profile cyberattacks. On the other hand, web applications (as well as web services) have become an inherent element of many supply chains. In order to protect the web services against some of the cyberattacks, one can adapt web application firewalls (WAF) solutions. However, quite often a challenge for typical WAF software is the fact that HTTP can be used as transport by other protocols or as a mix of other various encoding techniques. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a flexible schema for automated application layer request structure identification. Our experiments show that this technique allows us to further improve the effectiveness of known detection methods used in this research domain. In this paper, we show the possible practical application of the proposed cybersecurity solution in the public domain, namely public administration web-based systems and healthcare sectors. From the scientific point of view, we presented the results of various classifiers and pattern extraction techniques. We have also addressed the possible deployment of the proposed solution in Big Data-enabled environments. © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

Interactions with telemedicine or disease management and prediction are promising but are still underexploited. However, given rising health expenditure and shrinking budgets, data-driven cost-cutting is inevitably required. An interdisciplinary approach combines complementary aspects concerning big data, healthcare information technology, and PF investments. The methodology is based on a business plan of a standard healthcare Public-Private Partnership (PPP) investment, compared with a big data-driven business model that incorporates predictive analytics in different scenarios. When Public and Private Partners interact through networking big data and interoperable databases, they boost value co-creation, improving Value for Money and reducing risk. Big data can also help by shortening supply chain steps, expanding economic marginality and easing the sustainable planning of smart healthcare investments. Flexibility, driven by timely big data feedbacks, contributes to reducing the intrinsic rigidity of long-termed PF healthcare investments. Healthcare is a highly networked and systemic industry, that can benefit from interacting with big data that provide timely feedbacks for continuous business model re-engineering, reducing the distance between forecasts and actual occurrences. Risk shrinks and sustainability is fostered, together with the bankability of the infrastructural investment. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Prosperity and economic growth require robust specialization and exchange. This means the formation and maintenance of numerous complex supply chains. These are emergent and include supply chains for things and supply chains for ideas. The former involve transactions; the latter can be via transactions and/or realized positive externalities. All supply chains have a geographic dimension which is also emergent. Firms carefully choose what to make vs what to buy and also where to sell or buy it, near or far. The whole system tends to be a pattern of locations that denote realized transactions (and transactions costs) as well as realized externalities. The city remains a competitive producer if these relationships are encouraged with the attendant costs contained. Cities are “engines of growth.” They offer attractive supply chain formation and management opportunities, including the various spatially situated supply chains for things and ideas. The latter are more complex than textbook discussions of non-rival goods suggest. People are keen to identify and acquire useful knowledge. Consider (1) the advantages of open-source knowledge sharing have been acknowledged; (2) ideas often denote complex tacit knowledge exchange, and (3) access to useful knowledge is priced in land markets and impacts location choice. Favorable networking and location opportunities are significant. Flexible land markets facilitate the availability of such opportunities. Access to pools of human capital is clearly beneficial, but the ability to tailor access to the peculiar requirements of the firm is even better. Detailed firm location data for various sectors for the Los Angeles metropolitan areas are analyzed to support our claims. We estimate Ripley k-functions and note differences by industry as well as firm size. There is agglomeration that is near as well as far. This finding complicates “death of distance” as well as “clustering” discussions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Design/methodology/approach: A survey instrument was elaborated and data from a sample of 171 US firms were collected. The authors adopted cluster analysis to identify the IOF taxonomy. Canonical discriminant analysis was employed to uncover underlying dimensions between clustering variables and cluster membership. Then, ANOVA tests were conducted to investigate relationships between IOF configurations in the context of EI in supply chains. Findings: Three configurations were identified based on the complementarity and compatibility between focal firms and their supply chain partners. It is observed that the overall IOF level is positively related to firms’ EI outcomes. Moreover, inter-organizational complementarity facilitates incremental EI while inter-organizational compatibility plays a more crucial role in radical EI. Both are required to achieve the best innovation outcome. Originality/value: This research develops the first taxonomy for depicting IOF in a supply chain innovation context and also clarifies different rationale behind the development of incremental and radical EI through examining distinctive effects of the complementarity and compatibility with supply chain partners. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, the description of the global research network in the field of CL, research trends, and the discussion of advanced theories and practices have not been systematically reviewed so far. Especially in the past three years, there has been an explosive growth of relevant literature. In this paper, the method of combining scientometric analysis and thematic discussion was adopted to systematically review 513 important works in the literature from 1993 to 2018, aiming to provide a holistic understanding of the status in quo, trends and gaps of CL research, and to further analyze prominent problems. The study has made statistical analyses of the publication year profile, journal allocation and research methods of the included literature, and constructed four kinds of visualized bibliographic information timeline maps for the authorship network, international collaboration network, keywords co-occurrence network and research topic clustering. Then, the three themes summarized by clustering are discussed, mainly focusing on CL strategies and policy, green supply chain management, planning methods, and advanced concepts and practices. Finally, the research gaps framework and agenda were reported. This study contributes to summarizing the research and development of city logistics on the whole, and can also serve as an explorative manual to support sustainable urban freight activities and innovative research. © 2019 by the authors.},

A stochastic bi-objective optimisation model is developed that utilises a fuzzy c-means clustering method to quantify and assess the sustainability performance of the suppliers. The proposed model determines outsourcing decisions and resilience strategies that minimise the expected total cost and maximise the overall sustainability performance in disruptions.

The need to suggest a new approach to Non-Conformities Management is connected to those situations where a large variety of Non-Conformities is recorded, with a significant number of low-impacting ones; addressing them directly through methods like Root Cause Analysis would often be not economically viable. In this context, the paper discusses Holistic Non-Conformities Reduction (HNCR) approach as a suitable option to address this kind of business situations. In particular, the contribution of this paper is related to the development of HNCR model and the evaluation of how to properly structure the model and the flow that shall be followed. By clustering Non-Conformities into flexible categories to be easily modified, expanded and rearranged through time, the HNCR model allows to identify new critical Non-Conformity families, otherwise hardly detectable. A proof of concept relative to HNCR deployment is presented: 2 different scenarios are introduced, the first being the Non-Conformities management within the extended supply chain of a large pharmaceutical distribution centre, while the second deals with Non-Conformities in the context of a company's new programs development. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

However, inaccurate manual entries and delayed data collection have created difficulties in making full use of information. Meanwhile, difficulty sharing data and weak interoperability of data among business information systems also leaves company headquarters without the resource integration that can facilitate decision making. To overcome these challenges, we proposed a big data infrastructure called the enterprise integrated data platform (EIDP) for use by construction companies. We discuss a case study, and offer a framework for future business improvement that contributes to closed-loop construction supply chain management, cost management and control, knowledge discovery, and decision making. The proposed informatization solution provides a theoretical basis for realizing data sharing and interoperability between business management and project management. On this basis, it will help construction companies to improve the efficiency of both company operations and project delivery by optimizing the business process and supporting decision making. © 2019},

Our theoretical discussion on discerning industrial activity of firms in geographical regions starts by highlighting the limitations of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. This discussion is followed by the proposed methodology, which has three main steps revolving around web-based data collection, pre-processing and analysis, and reporting of clusters. We discuss each step in detail, presenting the experimental approaches tested. We apply our methodology to a regional case, in the North East of England, in order to demonstrate how such a big data decision support system/analytics can work in practice.

In this study, a distribution network for communicable diseases has been developed. The proposed network addresses Hepatitis A in Jordan as a case study, as it is considered one of the common communicable diseases in Jordan. Findings: A regression model was developed to predict future incidents of Hepatitis A in Jordan to build a distribution network based on the future required resources. An optimization clustering model was used to structure the appropriate distribution network. The proposed network was compared with the current network used for distribution of medications for Hepatitis A. Conclusion: The new network incurs less cost in delivering medications to the required hospitals as the traveling distance is less. As future work, it is recommended to incorporate more communicable diseases to develop more realistic distribution network. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {For achieving the sustainable consumption and production, designers and manufacturers should provide inexpensive products that create a low environmental load on the user. Accordingly, products and their components should exhibit a modular design, which can be achieved by considering some factors such as future reuse, remanufacturing, and upgrading. Modular design methods primarily focus to reduce the lead time or costs associated with designing an entire family of products. However, resource efficiency is an important consideration associated with reuse as well as with the production and procurement stages of manufacturing. Hence, proper supplier selection is crucial because new products comprise several components and modules supplied by various manufacturers. So, this paper proposes a modular design method and strategy based on supply chain management. Especially, the proposed method evaluates a modular design strategy based on the cost, environmental load in transportation, quality, and procurement lead time. After deriving modular architecture candidates by Design Structure Matrix clustering that divide functionally closer parts into groups, a proposed indicator is used to evaluate the efficiency of the candidates based on the modular architectures and suppliers. This study applies the proposed method to design a laptop computer and derives an appropriate modular architecture and suppliers with respect to each destination. © 2019 Penerbit Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.},

	abstract = {                             In this study hydrochemical, isotopic and multivariate statistical tools are combined with a recharge analysis and existing geophysical data to improve understanding of major factors controlling freshwater occurrence and the origins of high salinities in the multi-layered coastal aquifer system of the Great Maputo area in Mozambique. Access to freshwater in this semi-arid area is limited by an inefficient public supply network, scarce surface waters, long droughts and an increasing population growth. Groundwater has a large potential to enhance water security, but its exploitation is threatened by both coastal and inland salinization mechanisms that are poorly understood. A GIS approach is utilized to classify potential recharge zones based on hydrogeological properties and land use/cover, whereas potential recharge rates are estimated through a root zone water balance method. In combination with water stable isotope data results reveal that extreme rainfall events provide the most relevant contributions to recharge, and interception and evaporation play an important role in the low recharge areas. Hierarchical clustering of hydrochemical and isotopic data allows the classification of six water groups, varying from fresh to brackish/salt waters. Corresponding scatter plots and PHREEQC modelling show evaporation and mixing with seawater (up to 5%) as major processes affecting salinity in the area. The co-occurrence of high alkalinity and Cl concentrations, in combination with piezometric and geo-electrical data, suggests that: 1) inland brackish/salt groundwater is caused by mixing with seawater trapped within clay layers; and 2) brackish/salt surface waters result from seepage of brackish groundwater into rivers and wetlands, followed by evaporation, hence increasing salinity and δ                             18                             O values. Mixing with small fractions of trapped seawater as main salinity source, rather than halite dissolution, is further corroborated by Br/Cl ratios of brackish/salt water samples near the ocean ratio. Cation exchange upon salinization is mainly observed in the semi-confined aquifer, while freshening takes place in the phreatic aquifer, particularly in areas presenting high recharge rates.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Due to the increasing awareness and government policies towards environmental sustainability, organizations are extending their efforts to enhance environmental practices in their Supply Chain (SC). At the same time, they are integrating their SC activities in such a way so as to reduce system cost while satisfying the needs of their consumers. Thus, organizations collaborate with the efficient suppliers in order to meet the quality level and customers requirements in terms of economic and environmental aspect. In this study, an optimization mathematical model is formulated for selecting suppliers with respect to interrelated criteria while taking care of ecological feature. An application is illustrated on an Indian manufacturing company of microwave oven. We propose an integrated supplier selection approach that consists of three stages. In the first stage, a dimension reduction method is utilized to group the variables as per interrelated criteria. An integrated methodology of mean and standard deviation along with Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is employed in the second stage for assessing the performance of suppliers in quantitative terms. The final stage comprises of a bi-objective mathematical model. The model is formulated to minimize the system cost while simultaneously minimizing carbon emission. The model helps in efficient identification of the procurement amount of products and the appropriate distribution center (DC), which is based on customers demand and the DC capacity to deliver goods to the Retail Stores (RSs). A fuzzy goal programming approach is utilized further to create a trade-off between two contradictory goals of the optimization model. The results suggest that integrating environmental with economical aspect can improve the performance of the SC network. © 2019 Faculty of Organizational Sciences, Belgrade. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: In fast-growing forests such as Eucalyptus plantations, the correct determination of stand productivity is essential to aid decision making processes and ensure the efficiency of the wood supply chain. In the past decade, advances in remote sensing and computational methods have yielded new tools, techniques, and technologies that have led to improvements in forest management and forest productivity assessments. Our aim was to estimate and map the basal area and volume of Eucalyptus stands through the integration of forest inventory, remote sensing, parametric, and nonparametric methods of spatial prediction. Methods: This study was conducted in 20 5-year-old clonal stands (362 ha) of Eucalyptus urophylla S.T.Blake x Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. The stands are located in the northwest region of Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Basal area and volume data were obtained from forest inventory operations carried out in the field. Spectral data were collected from a Landsat 5 TM satellite image, composed of spectral bands and vegetation indices. Multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were used for basal area and volume estimation. Using ordinary kriging, we spatialised the residuals generated by the spatial prediction methods for the correction of trends in the estimates and more detailing of the spatial behaviour of basal area and volume. Results: The ND54 index was the spectral variable that had the best correlation values with basal area (r = − 0.91) and volume (r = − 0.52) and was also the variable that most contributed to basal area and volume estimates by the MLR and RF methods. The RF algorithm presented smaller basal area and volume errors when compared to other machine learning algorithms and MLR. The addition of residual kriging in spatial prediction methods did not necessarily result in relative improvements in the estimations of these methods. Conclusions: Random forest was the best method of spatial prediction and mapping of basal area and volume in the study area. The combination of spatial prediction methods with residual kriging did not result in relative improvement of spatial prediction accuracy of basal area and volume in all methods assessed in this study, and there is not always a spatial dependency structure in the residuals of a spatial prediction method. The approaches used in this study provide a framework for integrating field and multispectral data, highlighting methods that greatly improve spatial prediction of basal area and volume estimation in Eucalyptus stands. This has potential to support fast growth plantation monitoring, offering options for a robust analysis of high-dimensional data. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review and analyze the perishable inventory models along various dimensions such as its evolution, scope, demand, shelf life, replenishment policy, modeling techniques and research gaps. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 418 relevant and scholarly articles of various researchers and practitioners during 1990-2016 were reviewed. They were critically analyzed along author profile, nature of perishability, research contributions of different countries, publication along time, research methodologies adopted, etc. to draw fruitful conclusions. The future research for perishable inventory modeling was also discussed and suggested. Findings: There are plethora of perishable inventory studies with divergent objectives and scope. Besides demand and perishable rate in perishable inventory models, other factors such as price discount, allow shortage or not, inflation, time value of money and so on were found to be combined to make it more realistic. The modeling of inventory systems with two or more perishable items is limited. The multi-echelon inventory with centralized decision and information sharing is acquiring lot of importance because of supply chain integration in the competitive market. Research limitations/implications: Only peer-reviewed journals and conference papers were analyzed, whereas the manuals, reports, white papers and blood-related articles were excluded. Clustering of literature revealed that future studies should focus on stochastic modeling. Practical implications: Stress had been laid to identify future research gaps that will help in developing realistic models. The present work will form a guideline to choose the appropriate methodology(s) and mathematical technique(s) in different situations with perishable inventory. Originality/value: The current review analyzed 419 research papers available in the literature on perishable inventory modeling to summarize its current status and identify its potential future directions. Also the future research gaps were uncovered. This systemic review is strongly felt to fill the gap in the perishable inventory literature and help in formulating effective strategies to design of an effective and efficient inventory management system for perishable items. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Across all sectors within the energy and process industry, tremendous efforts have been devoted toward the development and operation of agile manufacturing techniques to respond to customer needs and volatile markets while at the same time control costs, improve efficiency, and reduce pollution. This has created a demand for systems to solve complex integrated planning and scheduling problems that bridge the gap between the different functional and strategic decision-making levels. Integration across supply chain decision levels is key to improving investment returns. Different approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem. However, most of them are problem-specific or applicable only to short time horizons. Clustering has the potential to handle such problems by grouping similar input parameters together and considerably reduce the model size while not compromising solution accuracy. This work presents a new class of clustering algorithms to support the integration of planning applications of different time scales. The clustering algorithms were formulated using integer programming with integral absolute error as similarity measure. The algorithms were successfully applied to clustering electricity demand data and applied to the unit commitment problem. The computational performances of the proposed normal and sequence clustering algorithms were compared against a full planning model that does not employ clustering. The results show a clear advantage in terms of solution time compared to the full-scale case while maintaining solution accuracy. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers},

	abstract = {Integrated management of water supply systems with efficient use of natural resources requires optimization of operational performances. Dividing the water supply networks into small units, so-called district metered areas (DMAs), is a strategy that allows the development of specific operational rules, responsible for improving the network performance. In this context, clustering methods congregate neighboring nodes in groups according to similar features, such as elevation or distance to the water source. Taking into account hydraulic, operational and mathematical criteria to determine the configuration of DMAs, this work presents the k-means model and a hybrid model, that combines a self-organizing map (SOM) with the k-means algorithm, as clustering methods, comparing four mathematical criteria to determine the number of DMAs, namely Silhouette, GAP, Calinski-Harabasz and Davies Bouldin. The influence of three clustering topological criteria is evaluated: the water demand, node elevation and pipe length, in order to determine the optimal number of clusters. Furthermore, to identify the best DMA configuration, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method was applied to determine the number, cost, pressure setting of Pressure Reducing Valves and location of DMA entrances. © 2019, Brazilian Journal of Water Resources.

The aim of this study is to improve the service levels of the blood supply chain by maximizing the availability and minimizing the wastage of blood. New configuration approaches are adapted from the successful methods of manufacturing sectors. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, whole blood (WB) demand and supply data between April 2015 to March 2016 has been taken. Data analytics tool “R” is used for statistical analysis. Two new configurations, namely a) Zonal Network and b) Pull system models have been developed to compare the existing blood supply chain. The performances of the proposed configurations have been compared with the existing system using suitable indicators computed using Arena simulation software12.0. The total shortage index (TSI) and total wastage index (TWI) are used as indicators of performance measures. Weights are assigned for shortage and wastage indices to the reconfigured models. The pull system model outperforms existing model and zone model by achieving zero wastage. In transfusion medicine, importance is given to the achievement of lesser percentage shortage than wastage. If the WB inventory in blood centers is sufficient enough and we have more than one zone for distribution, then we can reduce wastages level in the blood supply chain. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Three perspectives, including connectivity in trading ports and regions, centralities in the realm of complex network and potential marketing and regional impacts, and sixteen criteria are considered for this analysis. A visual approach has been also applied to highlight port connectivity and ship flows for the reader’s convenience. Findings: The paper shows that port connectivity and maritime logistics are enablers to promote Korean international trade in Northeast China through the ESER, and 25 major ports are well connected to promote international trade in the region with visual data of ship flows by ship type and by flag. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the lack of port management information systems among the countries in the ESER except Korea and Japan, this paper could not capture cargo types and amounts on board.

However, the common difference measure indices are established by the specific density function or distribution law of the risk probability distribution. In Knight uncertain environment, only the moments of the risk probability distribution can be obtained. This study proposes the difference moment measure method of risk probability distribution based on moment generating function and fuzzy data stream clustering for the retail supply chain unconventional emergency. The big data statistical analysis is performed on the risk assessment indices to obtain the moments of the risk probability distribution for unconventional emergency. The difference of moment generating functions for unconventional emergency risk is measured by the distance function in the real vector space of infinite dimensional moments and then the difference between the real distribution and the reference distribution of the risk probability for unconventional emergency is further measured by the moments. The main contribution of this study is that we propose a new difference measure method of risk probability distribution for unconventional emergency based on cloud model method, moment generating function theory, functional function and big data fuzzy statistics technology in Knight uncertain and big date environments, which can overcome the drawbacks of the existing difference measure methods for probability distributions. © 2019 Institute of Information Science.

	abstract = {Given the rapid diversification of products in the textile and apparel industry, manufacturers face significant new challenges in production. The life cycle of apparel products has contracted and is now, generally, a several-week season, during which time a majority of products are supposed to be sold. Products that do not sell well may be sold at a price lower than the fixed price, and products that do not sell at all within the sales period may eventually become forced disposal. This creates long-term management and environmental problems. In practice, shipping personnel determine when to ship products to stores after reviewing product sales information. However, they may not schedule or structure these shipments properly because they cannot effectively monitor sales for a large number of products. In this paper, shipment is considered to reduce the risk of product disposal on the premise of selling at a fixed price. Although shipment quantities are determined by various factors, we only consider the change in inventory at the logistics warehouse, since it is difficult to incorporate all factors into the analysis. From cluster analysis, it is found that shipping personnel should recognize a policy to sell products gradually over time. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of disposal, we forecast the inventory from conditional probability and are able to extract products out of a standard grouping using past data. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Information systems (IS) impact supply chain management (SCM) on processes such as planning, sourcing, and delivering, and at levels ranging from tactical operations to organisational strategy. The vast scope of IS and SCM relationships have resulted in diverse and disintegrated research on the topic. This paper offers a systematic literature analysis at the intersection of supply chain and information systems (SCIS), aiming to provide a classification for existing areas of research. This research is based on an analysis of more than 1500 articles published in peer-reviewed journals over the past four decades to classify topics and methods and to identify major trends and distinguish important research themes. The classification of the literature has identified major clusters of research in SCIS, and suggestions are made for future research in each of the identified clusters. In general, the findings point out that there is a dearth of research on topics such as ‘impact of IT on vertical disintegration of supply chains,’ ‘implications of new technologies for supply chains,’ and ‘concerns related to trust, governance, ownership, privacy, and security of data in supply chains.’ This work provides both researchers and practitioners with an insightful description of the current state of research in SCIS and related future trends in research and practice. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This paper explores a technique for sensing rogue seasonality at a supply chain echelon level. A signature and index based on cluster profiles of variables, which are meant to sense echelon-level generation and intensity of rogue seasonality, respectively, are proposed. Their validity is then established on echelons of a downstream coffee supply chain for five stock keeping units (SKUs) with contrasting rogue seasonality generation behaviour. The appropriateness of spectra as the domain for representing variables, data for which is daily sampled, is highlighted. Time-batching cycles which could corrupt the sensing are observed in variables, and the need to therefore filter them out in advance is also highlighted. The knowledge gained about the echelon location, intensity and time of generation of rogue seasonality could enable timely deployment of specific mitigation actions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A common problem in mega cities is congestion, due to the size of the automotive park, this makes that the perishable foods decreasing their organoleptic characteristics or increases their losses, which requires considering the effect of time on routing problems. The state of the art demonstrates the need to formulate new routing models that include the specific characteristics of perishable foods in order to reduce their losses. Design/methodology/approach: A mathematical model was formulated based on two classical models: The three-index vehicle flow model proposed by (Golden, Assad, Levy Gheysens, 1984) and the time window model proposed by (Cordeau, Desaulniers, Desrosiers, Solomon Soumis, 1999). We proposed a novel VRP Model that permits reductions loss due to the perishable. Findings: The optimum cost is found with AMPR for twenty nodes, six vehicles and six fruits. For more nodes, a two-phase strategy is proposed, first a clustering based on a modified p-median model and then a VRP for each cluster. Research limitations/implications: The results showed the need to investigate multiobjective models, since the performance measures can be efficiency, quality and response capacity; the model can be applied in other supply chains of perishable foods. Social implications: According to FAO in Logistics practices in the last mile generat between 10-30% of the perishable food loss in developing countries’ mega-cities. Originality/value: A last-mile logistics strategy is proposed to manage delivery routes for fresh fruits in mega-cities, considering the effect of congestion through travel time in the perishability function. The new model it uses the flow variable to control the amount of each fruit arriving to each node and the time variable to define fruit waste or loss depending on the time and type of fruit. © 2019, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

Sustainable supply chain management has been suggested for improving sustainability outcomes in supply chains, yet global supply chains pose unique challenges. This paper aims to provide a synthesis of the key elements of sustainable supply chain management in global supply chains. To achieve this goal, we conduct a rigorous systematic literature review of articles focused on sustainable supply chain management in global supply chains and apply structured content analysis to * mentioned articles spanning 15 years of research published in English-language, peer-reviewed journals. The research contributes by identifying configurations and governance mechanisms as key elements characterizing sustainable supply chain management in global supply chains and synthesizing their relationship with sustainability outcomes. Overall configurations characterized by a greater connection between the focal firm and multi-tier suppliers, managed directly or through third parties, are increasing trends suggested to better serve sustainability development and offer several areas for future research. The research also contributes to practice by providing managers of focal firms with global supply chains directions for improving sustainable outcomes in their supply chains. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Regional competitiveness can be improved by providing value-added services, such as transport and logistics services to both the local and global supply chains. Transport and logistics clusters have been shown to reduce trade transactions and to improve the efficiency of both local and international transactions. The aim of this study was to identify the sectors that comprise the transport and logistics cluster and to determine the cluster's associated economy-wide effects. Using a cross-sectional study design, location-specific competitive advantages and economic multipliers associated with the clustering of transport and logistics companies were computed for the North-West Province in South Africa. Findings illustrate that the transport and logistics cluster comprises seven sectors that associate positively with upstream and downstream multipliers in various sectors within the region. Additionally, the sectors in the cluster are relatively integrated and have high interlinkages. The cluster has potential for higher levels of integration once the cluster is strengthened. In the context of South Africa, this implies that transport and logistics cluster optimisation has a knock on effect on various industries including tourism as shown elsewhere. This study offers a unique econometric approach to identify and quantify the effects of transport and logistics clusters on regional competitiveness and provides practitioners and policy makers with insights into alternative strategies to enhance regional competitiveness and growth. © 2019 Editura Universitatii din Oradea.

	abstract = {Supply chain risk management has drawn the attention of practitioners and academics alike. One source of risk is demand uncertainty. Demand forecasting and safety stock levels are employed to address this risk. Most previous work has focused on point demand forecasting, given that the forecast errors satisfy the typical normal i.i.d. assumption. However, the real demand for products is difficult to forecast accurately, which means that—at minimum—the i.i.d. assumption should be questioned. This work analyzes the effects of possible deviations from the i.i.d. assumption and proposes empirical methods based on kernel density estimation (non-parametric) and GARCH(1,1) models (parametric), among others, for computing the safety stock levels. The results suggest that for shorter lead times, the normality deviation is more important, and kernel density estimation is most suitable. By contrast, for longer lead times, GARCH models are more appropriate because the autocorrelation of the variance of the forecast errors is the most important deviation. In fact, even when no autocorrelation is present in the original demand, such autocorrelation can be present as a consequence of the overlapping process used to compute the lead time forecasts and the uncertainties arising in the estimation of the parameters of the forecasting model. Improvements are shown in terms of cycle service level, inventory investment and backorder volume. Simulations and real demand data from a manufacturer are used to illustrate our methodology. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the unique value-adding characteristics of AM, define areas of viable application in a firm value chain and discuss common implications of AM adoption for companies and their processes. Design/methodology/approach: The research leverages a multi-case-study approach and considers interviews with AM adopting companies from the Swiss and central European region in the medical and industrial manufacturing industries. The authors rely on a value chain model comprising a new product development process and an order fulfillment process (OFP) to analyze the benefits of AM technologies. Findings: The research identifies and defines seven clusters within a firm value chain, where the application of AM could create benefits for the adopting company and its customers. The authors suggest that understanding the AM process chain and the design experience are key to explaining the heterogeneous industrial maturity of the presented clusters. The authors further examine the suitability of AM technologies with agile development techniques to pursue incremental product launches in hardware.

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the routing of blood collection vehicles for improving the platelet supply in the blood supply chain. In order to extract platelets, donated blood has to be processed at a central processing facility within six hours of donation time. Blood collection organizations have to dispatch collection vehicles and schedule pickups from the donation sites so that the donated units can be used in platelet production. Because of the accumulating behavior of donations and the six-hour processing time limit, routing of blood collection vehicles is a time-sensitive routing problem. We analyze the routing decisions in such a setting and propose an integrated clustering and routing framework to collect and process the maximum number of donations for platelet production. In our analysis, motivated by the practices in real-life, we cluster the donation sites so that only a single vehicle serves the donation sites in each cluster. In the proposed framework, we make the clustering and routing decisions in an integrated manner so that we can foresee the impact of adding a donation site to a cluster on the routing decisions. For the routing step, we propose several heuristic algorithms, two of which have a greedy nature and the others are based on a priori tour generation and selection scheme. To evaluate the performances of the proposed heuristics, we develop an upper bound by relaxing the number of vehicles so that one vehicle is available for each donation site. Using the proposed heuristic algorithms, we obtain solutions with around 15% optimality gaps with respect to the upper bound. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, this social buzz has the potential to be used as an automatic editorial criterion. Having this premise in consideration, this paper reports on the nowUP solution, a service developed with the main goal of automatically creating TV summaries of popular television programs (like football matches, talent or reality shows) based on the Twitter activity and integrating a part of that activity in the TV show summary. A data-mining engine continuously processes the activity of this social network looking for tweets associated with the TV shows. Based on the program metadata it indexes the twitter activity; correlates tweets; and creates clusters of peaks, being the relevant clusters associated with the highlights of the TV show. With this, the video engine automatically creates a full video summary (an edited sequence of TV highlights) and publishes it in an online platform and on a Catch-up TV service. The paper reports on the nowUP development and on the results of its evaluation, namely comparing its outputs with official editorial/professional video summaries. The results show that the solution was very successful in achieving the project main goal and users want to have access to this type of social buzz-based video summaries. The nowUP solution also promises potential gains in the value chain of TV producers and broadcasters. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Generator start-up is a pivotal step of transmission system self-healing after large-scale blackouts. Considering the uncertainty of initial power system situation after blackouts and line restoration during power system restoration, an online generator start-up algorithm based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and sparse autoencoder (SAE) is proposed for real-time decision making. First, an online decision support system and a generator start-up efficiency indicator involving the total generation capability and number of restored lines are proposed. Then, the SAE is deployed to learn the data relevant to generator start-up offline to establish a value network, which is used to rapidly estimate the optimal generator start-up efficiency indicator. Next, MCTS used for the online generator start-up is improved by the modified upper confidence bound apply to tree algorithm, move pruning technique, and value network. It is used to search the next line to be restored based on real-time situation. Finally, root parallelization computation is adopted and a decision-making method is proposed to improve the reliability of decision making. Simulation results of the New England 10-unit 39-bus power system and Western Shandong Power Grid of China demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can accomplish generator start-up step by step reliably. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Agile manufacturing represents modern production systems that rapidly respond to a fast-moving marketplace and connect customers to production. The success of an agile manufacturing system relies on multisource data analytics, which provide smart data-driven decision-making strategies to guide manufacturing and the supply chain system. In order to implement rapid manufacturing processes to respond to customer orders, supply-demand gap prediction plays a critical role. In this article, we study the problem of predicting supply-demand gap with respect to product types, categories, and spatiotemporal attributes. To this end, we propose and develop an end-to-end framework using an extendable deep neural network architecture for supply-demand gap reduction. The framework can process multiple customized input factors and automatically discover spatiotemporal supply-demand patterns from historical transaction data. A set of customized features are employed to build a general training model to predict future demand. Embedding layers are used to map high dimensional features into a smaller subspace for input data consolidation. Fully connected layers with activation functions are used to build the training architecture of the model. Customized data attributes can be concatenated from different layers in the deep learning neural network. In this way, multisource input data can be integrated with outputs of internal layers for a comprehensive demand prediction. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the network with real supply and demand data, which were acquired from warehouses of a manufacturing company. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed network was able to reduce supply-demand gap and provide a practical solution to long-term customer demand prediction. © 2019 by ASTM International.},

	abstract = {The emergence of smart cities aims at mitigating the challenges raised due to the continuous urbanization development and increasing population density in cities. To face these challenges, governments and decision makers undertake smart city projects targeting sustainable economic growth and better quality of life for both inhabitants and visitors. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a key enabling technology for city smartening. However, ICT artifacts and applications yield massive volumes of data known as big data. Extracting insights and hidden correlations from big data is a growing trend in information systems to provide better services to citizens and support the decision making processes. However, to extract valuable insights for developing city level smart information services, the generated datasets from various city domains need to be integrated and analyzed. This process usually referred to as big data analytics or big data value chain. Surveying the literature reveals an increasing interest in harnessing big data analytics applications in general and in the area of smart cities in particular. Yet, comprehensive discussions on the essential characteristics of big data analytics frameworks fitting smart cities requirements are still needed. This paper presents a novel big data analytics framework for smart cities called “Smart City Data Analytics Panel — SCDAP”. The design of SCDAP is based on answering the following research questions: what are the characteristics of big data analytics frameworks applied in smart cities in literature and what are the essential design principles that should guide the design of big data analytics frameworks have to serve smart cities purposes? In answering these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review on big data analytics frameworks in smart cities. The proposed framework introduces new functionalities to big data analytics frameworks represented in data model management and aggregation. The value of the proposed framework is discussed in comparison to traditional knowledge discovery approaches. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Suppliers play a crucial role in achieving the supply chain goals. In the context of risk management, suppliers are the most common source of external risks in modern supply chains. The recognition that continuity of supply chain flow under disruptive event is a critical issue has brought the attention of companies to the selection of resilient suppliers. In contrast to the extensive number of researches on traditional and green criteria of supplier selection, the criteria associated with resilient supplier selection are not well explored yet. This paper first seeks to explore the resilience criteria for supplier selection based on the notion of resilience capacities which can be divided into three categories: absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and restorative capacity. Absorptive capacity refers to the capability of system to withstand against disruptive event in prior or called as preparedness of supplier, while adaptive and restoration capacities imply the capability of supplier to adopt itself and restore from disruption or recoverability of supplier. We identified eight effective elements for resilience capacities which contribute to the resilience of suppliers. Advanced data mining approaches like predictive analytics models are used to predict the resilience value of each supplier. We applied ensemble methods by combining binomial logistics regression, classification and regression trees, and neural network to obtain better predictive performance than individual algorithm from the historical data to predict individual supplier’s resiliency. This resilience value, obtained from ensemble methods, is coupled with additional four variables to assess the suppliers’ overall performance and rank them using different supplier selection models. Finally, a case study has been performed on international plastic raw material suppliers for a U.S. based manufacturer. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {The application of Value-based Healthcare requires not only the identification of key processes in the clinical domain but also an adequate analysis of the value chain delivered to the patient. Data Science and Big Data approaches are technologies that enable the creation of accurate systems that model reality. However, classical Data Mining techniques are presented by professionals as black boxes. This evokes a lack of trust in those techniques in the medical domain. Process Mining technologies are human-understandable Data Science tools that can fill this gap to support the application of Value-Based Healthcare in real domains. The aim of this paper is to perform an analysis of the ways in which Process Mining techniques can support health professionals in the application of Value-Based Technologies. For this purpose, we explored these techniques by analyzing emergency processes and applying the critical timing of Stroke treatment and a Question-Driven methodology. To demonstrate the possibilities of Process Mining in the characterization of the emergency process, we used a real log with 9046 emergency episodes from 2145 stroke patients that occurred from January 2010 to June 2017. Our results demonstrate how Process Mining technology can highlight the differences between the flow of stroke patients compared with that of other patients in an emergency. Further, we show that support for health professionals can be provided by improving their understanding of these techniques and enhancing the quality of care. © 2019 by the author.

Leaks are costly as they create losses in precious water resources as well as treatment chemicals and energy required to produce drinking water. Therefore, the city of Montréal has implemented a pilot project to detect the leaks in a portion of its water supply network using noise loggers. The main shortcoming tackled is the inaccuracy of the current system as it can regularly present false rulings on new events. This article presents a novel approach for the analysis of the signals using k-means clustering and provides a set of models for leak detection.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the application of unsupervised machine learning in the international location decision (ILD). This paper addresses the need for a fast, quantitative and dynamic location decision framework. Design/methodology/approach: Unsupervised machine learning technique, i.e. k-means clustering, is used to carry out the analysis. In total, 24 different indicators of 94 countries, categorized into five groups, have been used in the analysis. After the clustering, the clusters have been compared and scored to select the feasible countries. Findings: A new framework is developed based on k-means clustering that can be used in ILD. This method provides a quantitative output without personal subjectivity. The indicators can be easily added or extracted based on the preferences of the decision-makers. Hence, it was found out that the unsupervised machine learning, i.e. k-means clustering, is a fast and flexible decision support framework that can be used in ILD. Research limitations/implications: Limitations include the generality of selected indicators and clustering algorithm used. The use of other methods and parameters may lead to alternate results. Originality/value: The framework developed through the research intends to assist the decision-makers in deciding on the facility locations. The framework can be used in international and national domains. It provides a quantitative, fast and flexible way to shortlist the potential locations. Other methods can also be used to further decide on the specific location. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Abnormal RFID data or outliers may arise in real cases. Therefore, we utilized outlier detection models to remove outlier data. The experiment results showed that machine learning-based models successfully classified RFID readings with high accuracy, and integrating outlier detection with machine learning models improved classification accuracy. We demonstrated the proposed classification model could be applied to real-time monitoring, ensuring false positives were filtered and hence not stored in the database. The proposed model is expected to improve warehouse management systems by monitoring delivered products to other supply chain partners. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Economic globalization is increasing connectedness among regions of the world, creating complex interdependencies within various supply chains. Recent studies have indicated that changes and disruptions within such networks can serve as indicators for increased risks of violence and armed conflicts. This is especially true of countries that may not be able to compete for scarce commodities during supply shocks. Thus, network-induced vulnerability to supply disruption is typically exported from wealthier populations to disadvantaged populations. As such, researchers and stakeholders concerned with supply chains, political science, environmental studies, etc. need tools to explore the complex dynamics within global trade networks and how the structure of these networks relates to regional instability. However, the multivariate, spatiotemporal nature of the network structure creates a bottleneck in the extraction and analysis of correlations and anomalies for exploratory data analysis and hypothesis generation. Working closely with experts in political science and sustainability, we have developed a highly coordinated, multi-view framework that utilizes anomaly detection, network analytics, and spatiotemporal visualization methods for exploring the relationship between global trade networks and regional instability. Requirements for analysis and initial research questions to be investigated are elicited from domain experts, and a variety of visual encoding techniques for rapid assessment of analysis and correlations between trade goods, network patterns, and time series signatures are explored. We demonstrate the application of our framework through case studies focusing on armed conflicts in Africa, regional instability measures, and their relationship to international global trade. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore why and how firms with logistics-intensive operations such as fast-moving consumer good (FMCG) distributors benefit from residing in logistics clusters. In particular, this study seeks to fill a gap in the understanding of how logistics clustering may influence FMCG firms’ distribution capabilities. Design/methodology/approach: Three case studies of FMCG distributors geographically agglomerated within Q Logistics Cluster in Jordan serve to elaborate the existing theory of clustering. Data were collected from 24 interviews as well as observational evidence of the FMCG distributors’ outbound logistics operations. The unit of analysis was the interaction between FMCG distributors and other agents in the logistics cluster. Findings: FMCG distributors tend to gravitate to clusters where logistics service providers and other FMCG firms co-locate. FMCG distributors interact intensively and benefit greatly from building ties with non-competitor distributors in a cluster. Informal personal relations, collaborative activities and knowledge sharing, learning opportunities and resource availability were found to act as mechanisms for generating distribution capabilities within a logistics cluster. Practical implications: This study provides practical implications for FMCG logistics and distribution managers who make distribution centre (DC) location decisions. The study provides such managers and their firms with a deeper understanding of the importance of co-locating DCs in logistics clusters, and may help them in designing their supply networks. Originality/value: This is the first scholarly work to uncover the various ways in which FMCG distributors benefit from logistics clustering and explain why they may differ in performance, building on observations of their capabilities. The study provides insight from an emerging market and encourages future researchers to conduct further studies on logistics clustering in order to bring relevant theory forward. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The literature on low carbon supply chain management has expanded, however, a systematic review of lessons learned and future research opportunities is necessary. We do this using a review of the literature and social network analysis. The data for this study consists of English articles published by multiple databases found through the Web of Science and Scopus. We reviewed, collected, and sorted articles from 124,793 publications and then identified 2199 as being relevant to the scope of work for this study. Next, we utilized a social network analysis of the data. The results uncovered six main domains of LCSC: sustainability, climate change, green supply chain management, supply chain management, innovation, sustainable development, and environmental management. Contributions of this study include the development of these domains along with several important themes. The insights uncovered by our analysis primarily focus on LCSC modelling, low carbon energy, and carbon emission measurements. Numerous sustainability management practices are associated with low carbon energy use and actions to avoid increasing the rate of climate change. Paradoxically, we find limited evidence in the literature on how the LCSC practices can achieve integrated levels of performance that should also include carbon performance indicators. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

We use a unique data set from our own primary survey of the aquaculture value chain in Bangladesh, including micro data for 1500 fish farm households and 20 districts (77 villages) for meso level data. We calculate an index to include both horizontal agglomeration and vertical interconnections among actors in the value chain.

Clustering analysis can divide the groups constructing the strong connecting supply chain with large emissions from the global supply chain network, and structural path betweenness represents how much CO2 emissions from the supply chain paths a sector has in global supply chain network. I applied the combined method to the EORA database which covers 189 countries and focused on the whole global supply chain networks in detail. The results demonstrate that the global supply chain networks of transport equipment were well separated into emission clusters with higher emissions that consist of sectors with higher structural path betweenness. Chinese emission clusters were identified from the global supply chain networks for the five countries in question and the betweenness of Chinese sectors tend to be higher values in the supply chain networks. In this study, I suggested supply chain management of high priority sectors for a reduction in CO2 emissions of transport equipment in the producing countries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Identifying malformed proteins at the point-of-care can prevent adverse immune reactions in patients; this is of special concern when there is an insecure supply chain resulting in the delivery of degraded, or even counterfeit, drug product. Identification of degraded protein, for example human growth hormone, is demonstrated by applying automated anomaly detection algorithms. Detection of the degraded protein differs from previous applications of machine-learning and classification to spectral analysis: only example spectra of genuine, high-quality drug products are used to construct the classifier. The algorithm is tested on Raman spectra acquired on protein dilutions typical of formulated drug product and at sample volumes of 25 μL, below the typical overfill (waste) volumes present in vials of injectable drug product.

Problem Statement: To organize and search vast data better computational tools are required and extract them by understanding the knowledge patterns invisible and unlabeled in the data. To notify various decision-making activities all over the product value chain and manufacturing areas, it evolves a challenging way to identify important information taken away through the web. This was the problem identified by many of the organizations. Proposed Solution: In this proposed research paper, a novel approach to provoke the progress of the Search and Organize text documents as well as extract patterns in manufacturing corpus by applying unsupervised document clustering and topic modeling which is statistical modeling technique through Deep Learning are proposed. Topic modelling is an effective technique for both classifying and characterizing hidden patterns in corpora. Topic modeling implements processing of data similar to text mining. The proposed method choose LDA technique and topic modeling algorithm, where web pages of various manufacturing service providers are used to construct the corpus and manufacture suppliers are used to generating the area of application. For complex unstructured and unsupervised data, use of Document Clustering in association with topic modeling aids the progress for automated annotation and web pages classification. This improves the domain supplier search and information retrieval tools. Moreover, the terms that are extracted from topic modeling process are collaborated with other reference models such as Thesauri and Ontologies of manufacturing industry to enable bottom-up Knowledge Extraction. © 2019, Research Trend.

	abstract = {Integration of the Internet into the entities of the different domains of human society (such as smart homes, health care, smart grids, manufacturing processes, product supply chains, and environmental monitoring) is emerging as a new paradigm called the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the ubiquitous and wide-range IoT networks make them prone to cyberattacks. One of the main types of attack is a denial of service (DoS), where the attacker floods the network with a large volume of data to prevent nodes from using the services. An intrusion detection mechanism is considered a chief source of protection for information and communications technology. However, conventional intrusion detection methods need to be modified and improved for application to the IoT owing to certain limitations, such as resource-constrained devices, the limited memory and battery capacity of nodes, and specific protocol stacks. In this paper, we develop a lightweight attack detection strategy utilizing a supervised machine learning-based support vector machine (SVM) to detect an adversary attempting to inject unnecessary data into the IoT network. The simulation results show that the proposed SVM-based classifier, aided by a combination of two or three incomplex features, can perform satisfactorily in terms of classification accuracy and detection time. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {One of the natural consequences of lending practices by banks and credit institutions has been the creation of deferred and doubtful loans- a phenomenon that has become a major concern for these institutions and has had a negative impact on their revenue and expenditure. From an internal perspective, operating costs, work efficiency, profitability, customer service, branch rank, employee wages and salaries, and other qualitative indicators are significantly affected. From an external perspective, these loans lead to slow cash flow, lack of timely and optimal allocation of resources to manufacturing networks and industries, low employment rates, and eventually economic recession. The purpose of this research is to cluster bank customers and determine the behavioral pattern of each cluster for supply chain finance using K-Means, FCM, and SUB Cluster models in Clementine 18.0, MATLAB 2016, and Excel software. 35 models were compared with a variety of parameters. After removing nonessential variables, the models were rerun and the outputs for each customer cluster were provided. The results showed that creditworthiness, education, job, collateral value, collateral type, loan term, and age respectively had the greatest impact. Finally, the K-Means model was found to be the most appropriate clustering technique. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

In the present paper, I discuss the value to agriculture from AI over the next decade. The more immediate applications will be to improve precision information about what is happening on the farm by improving what is being detected and measured. A consequence of this are more accurate alerts to farmers. Another is an increased ability to understand why phenomena occur in farm systems, so as to improve their management. From improved data and understanding come improved predictions, enabling more optimal decisions about how to manage farm systems and stimulating the development of decision support and recommender systems. In many cases, robotics and automated systems will remove much of the need for human decision-making and improve farm efficiencies and farm health. Artificial intelligence will also be needed to enable organisations to harness the value of information distributed throughout supply chains, including farm data. Digital twins will also emerge as an important paradigm to improve how information about farm entities is organised to support decision-making. There are also likely to be negative impacts from AI, such as disruption to the roles and skills needed from farm workers, indicating the need to consider the social and ethical impacts of AI each time a new capability is introduced. I conclude that understanding these challenges more deeply tends to highlight new opportunities for positive change. © 2020 CSIRO.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is twofold. First, to explore and classify factors influencing traceability implementation, and second, to cluster essential traceability-related information that demands recording and sharing with businesses and customers, in the context of the textile and clothing supply chain. A Delphi study is conducted with 23 experts (including research practitioners and industry experts) to explore, validate, and classify traceability factors and related information using distribution analyses and hierarchal clustering. As a result, 14 factors and 19 information sets are identified and classified with a moderately high agreement among the experts. Among these, risk management, product authentication, and visibility are the highest ranked and the most important factors influencing traceability implementation in the textile and clothing supply chain. While origin, composition, and sustainability-related information are crucial for sharing with customers, the information vital to businesses includes manufacturer/supplier details, product specifications, and composition. It is noteworthy that this research is among the few that classifies traceability factors and information through expert perspectives, and it creates decisive knowledge of traceability for the textile and clothing supply chain. It further provides insights on the extent to which this information can be shared among supply chain actors. Outcomes of this study can be helpful for the development of an information traceability framework. Policymakers can use the results to draft traceability guidelines/regulations, whilst top management can develop traceability-related strategies. © 2019 by the authors.},

Against this backdrop, we examine economic opportunities for hardwood manufacturers to achieve greater competitive advantage via product customization, through a literature review and synthesis. We also discuss several related themes including agility, lean manufacturing, and clustering. We found that, in globally competitive environments, hardwood producers must be agile to adapt to economic conditions and dynamic customer demand. We discuss how some sectors of the hardwood industry have effectively exhibited customized production, and subsequently fared relatively well in the current economy. We conclude the synthesis by evaluating the importance of supply chains to achieving customization for hardwood producers. In the future, supply chains will need to be configured to rapidly respond to changing consumer demands, and pressure to provide more services will likely extend further back up the supply chain to hardwood sawmills. It is expected that sustainability practices, including green supply chain management, will impact operational and economic performance of hardwood firms as well. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In Retail 4.0, omni-channels require a seamless and complete integration of all available channels for purchasing. The diversification of channels not only diversifies data sources, but also rapidly generates an enormous amount of data. This highlights a need of big data analytics to extract meaningful knowledge for decision-making. In addition, anticipatory shipping is getting more popular to ensure fast product delivery. The goal is to predict when a customer will make a purchase and then begin shipping the product to the nearest distribution centres before the customer places the orders online. This paper proposes a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimisation model to support anticipatory shipping. Cloud computing is deployed to store the big data generated from all channels. Cluster-based association rule mining is applied to discover the purchase pattern and predict future purchase in terms of If-Then prediction rules. A modified GA is then used to generate optimal anticipatory shipping plans. Apart from transportation cost and travelling distance, the confidence of prediction rules is also considered in the GA. A number of numerical experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the trade-off of different factors in anticipatory shipping, and the optimisation reliability of the model is verified. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {In past recent years, by increasing in the considerations on the significance of data science many studies have been developed concerning the big data structured problems. Along with the information science, in the field of decision science, multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches have been considerably applied in research studies. One of the most important procedures in supply chain management is selecting the optimal supplier to maintain the long-term productivity of the supply chain. There has been a vast amount of research which utilized MADM approaches to tackle the supplier selection problems, but only a few of these research considered big data structured problems. The current study presents a comprehensive novel approach for improving Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based on cluster analysis considering crisp big data structure input which is called CLUS-MCDA (Cluster analysis for improving Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis) algorithm. The proposed method is based on consolidating a data mining technique i.e. k-means clustering method and a MADM approach which is MULTIMOORA method. CLUS-MCDA method is a fast and practical approach which has been developed in this research which is implied in a supplier selection problem considering crisp big data structured input. A real-world case study in MAMUT multi-national corporation has been presented to show the validity and practicality of the CLUS-MCDA approach which calculated considering the business areas and criteria based on expert comments of mentioned organizations and previous literature on supplier selection problem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of automatically and therefore quickly detecting a specific disturbance, which is constrained capacity at a supply chain echelon. Design/methodology/approach - Different supply chain echelons of a simulated four echelon supply chain were individually capacity constrained to assess their impacts on the profiles of system variables, and to develop a signature that related the profiles to the echelon location of the capacity constraint. A review of disturbance detection techniques across various domains formed the basis for considering the signaturebased technique. Findings - The signature for detecting a capacity constrained echelon was found to be based on cluster profiles of shipping and net inventory variables for that echelon as well as other echelons in a supply chain, where the variables are represented as spectra. Originality/value - Detection of disturbances in a supply chain including that of constrained capacity at an echelon has seen limited research where this study makes a contribution. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Recognizing construction assets (e.g., materials, equipment, labor) from point cloud data of construction environments provides essential information for engineering and management applications including progress monitoring, safety management, supply-chain management, and quality control. This study introduces a novel principal axes descriptor (PAD) for construction-equipment classification from point cloud data. Scattered as-is point clouds are first processed with downsampling, segmentation, and clustering steps to obtain individual instances of construction equipment. A geometric descriptor consisting of dimensional variation, occupancy distribution, shape profile, and plane counting features is then calculated to encode three-dimensional (3D) characteristics of each equipment category. Using the derived features, machine learning methods such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine are employed to determine class membership among major construction-equipment categories such as backhoe loader, bulldozer, dump truck, excavator, and front loader. Construction-equipment classification with the proposed PAD was validated using computer-aided design (CAD)-generated point clouds as training data and laser-scanned point clouds from an equipment yard as testing data. The recognition performance was further evaluated using point clouds from a construction site as well as a pose variation data set. PAD was shown to achieve a higher recall rate and lower computation time compared to competing 3D descriptors. The results indicate that the proposed descriptor is a viable solution for construction-equipment classification from point cloud data. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To understand inventory performance, transfusion services commonly use key performance indicators (KPIs) as summary descriptors of inventory efficiency that are graphed, trended, and used to benchmark institutions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Here, we summarize current limitations in KPI-based evaluation of blood bank inventory efficiency and propose process mining as an ideal methodology for application to inventory management research to improve inventory flows and performance. RESULTS: The transit of a blood product from inventory receipt to final disposition is complex and relates to many internal and external influences, and KPIs may be inadequate to fully understand the complexity of the blood supply chain and how units interact with its processes. Process mining lends itself well to analysis of blood bank inventories, and modern laboratory information systems can track nearly all of the complex processes that occur in the blood bank. CONCLUSION: Process mining is an analytical tool already used in other industries and can be applied to blood bank inventory management and research through laboratory information systems data using commercial applications. Although the current understanding of real blood bank inventories is value-centric through KPIs, it potentially can be understood from a process-centric lens using process mining. © 2017 AABB},

To achieve this goal, Cloud manufacturing system has been proposed. One of the most important issues in Cloud manufacturing is service composition, in which composition of cloud services is determined to meet customer orders. This paper considers a single-product supply network over one period in Cloud manufacturing system with the goal of service composition optimization. The network is designed in a layered structure considering transportation and production services and customers can be classified in specific clusters. A new algorithm is proposed to assign the services to the network layers, and the problem is formulated as a mixed integer model with the objective of maximizing the profit of the network. Also as the problem has an NP-hard origin a meta-heuristic algorithm is exploited to solve it. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the case study methodology to derive conclusions that contribute to the development of a theory about the success factors of emblematic hotels. The case selected is the Spanish Tourist Parador chain. The authors carried out over a period of two years a data mining analysis of the online comments posted by its guests. Findings: The results indicate that the attributes of location and facilities are critical success factors expected a priori given the nature of the business of such establishments, based on the singular nature of the buildings. Another critical success factor is personnel, which seems to indicate that the Paradors support their business model by employing highly qualified staff, but give less attention to restaurant services or the room, according to guest perceptions. Originality/value: The paper provides required evidence on the critical success factors of emblematic hotels adapting Porter’s value chain, for the tourism accommodation sector, through the analysis of direct value chain activities. In addition, the existing literature is broadened by taking a perspective scarcely studied, the guest perception of hotel establishments, online content posted by the user on the establishment’s website, rather than simply considering the traditional views of the experts/managers, through structures questionnaires.

	abstract = {In modern supply chain, logistics companies usually operate individually and optimization researches often concentrate on solving problems related to separate networks. Consequences like the complexity of urban transportation networks and long distance deliveries or pickups and pollution are leading problems to more expenses and more complaints from environment protection organizations. A solution approach to these issues is proposed in this article and consists in the adoption of two-echelon heterogeneous cooperative logistics networks (THCLN). The optimization methodology includes the formation of cooperative coalitions, the reallocation of customers to appropriate logistics facilities, and the determination of the best profit allocation scheme. First, a mixed integer linear programing model is introduced to minimize the total operating cost of nonempty coalitions. Thus, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm are hybridized to propose GA-PSO heuristics. GA-PSO is employed to provide good solutions to customer clustering units' reallocation problem. In addition, a negotiation process is established based on logistics centers as coordinators. The case study of Chongqing city is conducted to verify the feasibility of THCLN in practice. The grand coalition and two heterogeneous subcoalitions are designed, and the collective profit is distributed based on cooperative game theory. The Minimum Cost Remaining Savings (MCRS) model is used to determine good allocation schemes and strictly monotonic path principles are considered to evaluate and decide the most appropriate coalition sequence. Comparisons proved the combination of GA-PSO and MCRS better as results are found closest to the core center. Therefore, the proposed approach can be implemented in real world environment, increase the reliability of urban logistics network, and allow decision makers to improve service efficiency. © 2018 Yong Wang et al.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify how organizations can evaluate the green product deletion decision within an environmentally sustainable consumption and production environment through a hybrid multistage multiple criteria evaluation approach. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a decision-making model by integrating "soft computation" using neighborhood rough set theory, fuzzy cluster means, and cumulative prospect theory. Literature is used to identify various factors for the decision environment. An illustrative problem provides insights into the methodology and application. Findings - The results indicate that green products can be evaluated from both their relative environmental burdens and benefits. Sustainable consumption and production factors that play a role in this multifactor decision are identified. The results show that a comprehensive evaluation can capture an effective overall picture on which green product(s) to delete. Research limitations/implications - The opaqueness of the proposed methodology may cause less acceptance by management. The methodology made a number of assumptions related to the data. An actual application of the tool rather than just an illustrative example is needed. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is the novel integration of supply chain perspectives, both upstream (supply and production) and downstream (demand/usage), with green product deletion decision making. The hybrid multistage technique has advantages of being able to incorporate many factors that have a variety of quantitative and qualitative characteristics to help managers address green product deletion issues as well as its impact on greening of supply chains and organizational environmental sustainability. This paper adds value to product deletion, supply chain management, and sustainable production and consumption literatures. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Salmon muscle gaping will lead to the irregular voids or undesirable lace-like appearance in the final product. This study was carried out to develop an automatic imaging analysis method for rapid, accurate, and non-invasive detection of gaping blemishes on salmon carcasses. Salmon fillets could be classified as wholesome or defective samples based on the number of candidate gaping regions in the preliminary step applying local adaptive thresholding. Supervised classification results were compared between using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and convolutional neural network (CNN) feature extractors. It was shown that CNN features outperformed HOG features with correct classification rates (CCRs) of 0.927 and 0.916 for cross validation and test data set, respectively. Relieff was then applied to select important feature attributes by reducing the 4096-dimensional to 239-dimensional vector. Simplified CNN model also yielded good classification performance with CCR of 0.925 for cross validation. Therefore, CNNs were used to extract features from candidate regions and then reduced features to the 239-dimensional vector. The resultant vector was fed to the simplified CNN model to make a final decision. The prediction maps for visualizing the classification result on salmon fillet were subsequently generated. The overall results confirmed that this proposed method is effective and suitable for the muscle gaping detection. Future work will be focused on applying this method in packing plants where fish fillets are progressing rapidly, and promising results will allow the identification of critical points in the supply chain that impact upon product quality. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Based on these theoretical underpinnings, the present paper describes a structural input–output analysis of the inter-sectoral linkages and main activity clusters of the Greek economy, which is modeled as a complex network. Such an analysis employs suitable network metrics to measure the centrality and influence of each sector-agent on the other ones, and the possibilities for clustering of related (groups of) activities. Key sectors related to the production of tradable goods and services are identified, in terms of their marginal ability to pull the total economic activity. Critical sectors are also determined in terms of their ability to retain the interconnectivity and strengthen the stability of the whole economic system. It is argued that more synergies within and among the activity clusters, through the creation of integrated value chains, would allow better coordination of policies, more efficient allocation of resources and enhanced diffusion of knowledge. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Establishment of a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network has attracted immense significance due to government policies and societal demand for environmental consciousness. However, to enhance the financial and ecological impact of the network, the forward and reverse supply chain networks must integrate well so that decisions taken in both areas complement each other. In this study, we propose an eco-efficient CLSC design for extending the existing supply chain of an Indian firm that assembles inkjet printers. The network design is configured as a multi-objective model in a multi-period setting and is mathematically formulated into a mixed integer programming problem with fuzzy objectives. Fuzziness provides flexibility to the decision makers because they must accommodate the conflicting nature of the objectives. The fuzzy multi-objective model incorporates the firm's economic and environmental concerns into the decision making process by selecting environmentally responsible suppliers to procure components based on sustainable criteria, choosing appropriate recovery options for end-of-use (EOU) inkjet printers, and planning an efficient transportation network design for reducing the carbon emission of the distribution and collection activities. The uniqueness of the proposed fuzzy CLSC optimization model lies in providing an integrated decision making framework that can aid the manufacturer in making crucial strategic, tactical, and operational decisions of optimal selection of suppliers, component order allocation, recovery flow allocation, and vehicle routing planning. The novelty of the model also lies in simultaneously minimising the overall cost of the activities undertaken, maximizing the performance of the component suppliers and minimising the carbon emissions of the associated transportation activities. A weighted fuzzy mathematical programming approach is utilised for generating a fuzzy, properly efficient solution as the desired compromised solution for the CLSC network problem configuration. The relevance of the model is justified using a real data set derived from a case study of the firm based in the northern capital region (NCR) of India. The findings indicate that the proposed integrated CLSC network model enables the firm in gaining sustainably from the numerous electronic product reuse opportunities in the Indian market. Further, while costly to begin with, choosing suppliers with higher sustainable performance and vehicles with lesser emission rate could substantially enhance firm's sustainable image and result in higher profits in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {We view supply chains as a type of complex adaptive system and develop an agent based computer simulation model of the evolution and performance of supply chains based on Stuart Kauffman’s NK models of fitness landscapes. Firms operate in networks in which they supply products to some firms and source inputs from others. They seek to maximize their own performance but they cooperate with other firms to gain access to inputs. We model firm performance in terms of the fit of its product with market demand and the contribution from first tier suppliers. The model uses genetic algorithms to mimic the way firms learn and adapt their products and supplier networks for more and less complex products and different switching conditions. We find that (a) as the complexity of the product increases, firms perform less well; and (b) firms build supplier networks with higher average in-degree, greater density, and significantly greater clustering to cope with product complexity. Our findings suggest that firms using highly specific assets or that face high switching costs are likely to pursue a supplier strategy that relies more on multiple suppliers and more clustered supply networks. Also, in industries characterized by highly specialized training, plants and machinery dedicated to specific products and other high product-specific transaction costs, we should observe more specialization at low levels of product complexity but less at high levels. The model contributes to our understanding of the evolution of supply networks, which is an under-researched topic, provides the basis for further extensions of the model and the development of more realistic models of actual supply chains. The model also provides a conceptual and methodological tool to assist firms and policymakers to better understanding the nature of supply chains and to identify and test strategies and policies. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Inventory management in today's complex manufacturing environments has become increasingly challenging. Ineffective management of inventory can lead to material shortages, excessive inventories, long lead times, waste of space, and poor customer service. Nowadays, various companies are using information systems to establish effective linkages to suppliers, customers, and other agents in the supply chain. These information systems include comprehensive data warehouses that integrate operational data within the supply chain including part usage, customer demand, defect rates, etc. The data can be used in analytics models to improve warehouse operations and inventory management. In this research, an approach is proposed for warehouse inventory management based on part clustering. The proposed approach categorises inventory parts based on their pick frequency, age, price, and sensitivity to transportation. Part grouping helps the decision makers to identify whether to keep the part in the warehouse, move it to an offsite inventory storage, or scrap it. The approach also determines when and how many parts should be moved from the offsite storage to the internal warehouse in order to balance the inventory and minimise the transportation costs. Dynamic reports are generated on a regular basis to effectively manage the inventory. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

We assume that the designers cannot enumerate all their considerations in closed-form, precise mathematical expressions but they can examine the merits of solutions with respect to their preferences and can compare candidate solutions with one another. We propose a three-stage framework to take the decision-makers' such considerations into account. The first step is to obtain a diverse set of designs that can all be considered efficient in terms of a performance metric (i.e., the objective function values of the simulation optimization model). These solutions are then passed on to the decision-makers to be analyzed in terms of their preferences that could not have been previously considered. Finally, the most appropriate solution is chosen. We address the problem encountered in the first step as a multimodal optimization problem. We address the second and the third subproblems as a preference aggregation problem in the social choice theory. We also illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through a supply chain design problem inspired from the literature. We use the crowding clustering genetic algorithm as an example to demonstrate the first step. We use a multiplicative variant of the popular analytic hierarchy process to illustrate how the second and the third steps can be handled. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate a clonal relationship among thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. isolates from different stages of the poultry meat supply chain in Argentina. A total of 128 thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. (89 C. jejuni and 39 C. coli) isolates from six poultry meat chains were examined. These isolates were from: a) hens from breeder flocks, b) chickens on the farm (at ages 1 wk and 5 wk), c) chicken carcasses in the slaughterhouse, and d) chicken carcasses in the retail market. Chickens sampled along each food chain were from the same batch. Campylobacter spp. isolates were analyzed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to compare different profiles according to the source. Clustering of C. jejuni isolates resulted in 17 profiles, with four predominant genotypes and many small profiles with just a few isolates or unique patterns, showing a very high degree of heterogeneity among the C. jejuni isolates. Some clusters included isolates from different stages within the same chain, which would indicate a spread of strains along the same poultry meat chain. Moreover, twenty-two strains of C. coli clustered in seven groups and the remaining 17 isolates exhibited unique profiles. Evidence for transmission of thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. through the food chain and cross contamination in the slaughterhouses were obtained. This collective evidence should be considered as the scientific basis to implement risk management measures to protect the public health. © 2017 Asociación Argentina de Microbiología},

The cloud model generation algorithm of early warning summary is used to generate the early warning summary data based on the multiple data fusion method. The evolutionary datastream clustering algorithm of early warning classification is used to dynamically forecast the harming degree of cluster supply chain emergency based on time decaying model and sliding window model. Compared to other similar algorithms, the algorithm proposed in this paper increased the classification accuracy by 92.6% while reduced operation time by 66.7%.

Therefore companies should understand what the retention and value drivers are for each customer. An approach that can help consider customers' different value dimensions is the value network. This paper aims to introduce a new approach using data mining techniques for mapping and analyzing customers' value network. Besides, this approach is applied in a real case study. This research contributes to develop and implement a methodology to identify and define network entities of a value network in the context of B2B relationships. To conduct this work, we use a combination of methods and techniques designed to analyze customer data-sets (e.g. RFM and customer migration) and to analyze value network. As a result, this paper develops a new strategic network view of customers and discusses how a company can add value to its customers. The proposed approach provides an opportunity for marketing managers to gain a deep understanding of their business customers, the characteristics and structure of their customers' value network. This paper is the first contribution of its kind to focus exclusively on large data-set analytics to analyze value network. This new approach indicates that future research of value network can further gain the data mining tools. In this case study, we identify the value entities o f the network and its value flows in the telecommunication organization using the available data in order to show that it can improve the value in the network by continuous monitoring.},

The aim of the study is to analyse consumers’ attitude towards fresh-cut salad with an extended shelf life date. The analysis was based on face-to-face interviews with 351 consumers living in Lombardy, one of the Italian provinces where the consumption of fresh-cut salad is high and characterized by good margins of development. Principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation was used as preliminary data preparation for market segmentation. Cluster analysis revealed the presence of three different consumers groups. Only the cluster of ‘favorable’ shows a positive attitude towards the extended shelf life date. Consumers grouped in the cluster of ‘skeptical’ associate such innovation to a low level of product freshness. The cluster of ‘mistrust’ reveals the presence of consumers with safety concerns towards the prolongation of the shelf life date. Such consumers do not reveal a high level of trust in processing firms and their related brands. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

The key research findings include: (i) How to identify a categorised pattern of a human decision model, particularly concerning purchasing operations; and (ii) Which metrics would be relevant in the objective of carrying out a quantitative analysis on decision behaviour. The order placement behaviour is studied as one of daily operational decisions. The work demonstrates how to analyse a potential relationship between each category of behaviour and selected measures of supply chain performance, i.e., average inventory level and delivery satisfaction. We developed a specialised tool for supply chain simulation aimed at collecting data such as information consultations and decision-making actions of purchasing operations. The methodology is composed of sub-processes, such as data log file generation, data parsing and information generation, behaviour profile identification through clustering, and the analysis of supply performance regarding each category of decision-making behaviour. Through experimentation with industrial purchasing agents, we validated the effectiveness of the approach and demonstrated how to achieve a quantitative analysis of decision-making behaviour and its impact on supply performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Empirical analyses of supply chain networks (SCNs) in extant literature have been rare due to scarcity of data. As a result, theoretical research have relied on arbitrary growth models to generate network topologies supposedly representative of real-world SCNs. Our study is aimed at filling the above gap by systematically analysing a set of manufacturing sector SCNs to establish their topological characteristics. In particular, we compare the differences in topologies of undirected contractual relationships (UCR) and directed material flow (DMF) SCNs. The DMF SCNs are different from the typical UCR SCNs since they are characterised by a strictly tiered and an acyclic structure which does not permit clustering. Additionally, we investigate the SCNs for any self-organized topological features. We find that most SCNs indicate disassortative mixing and power law distribution in terms of interfirm connections. Furthermore, compared to randomised ensembles, self-organized topological features were evident in some SCNs in the form of either overrepresented regimes of moderate betweenness firms or underrepresented regimes of low betweenness firms. Finally, we introduce a simple and intuitive method for estimating the robustness of DMF SCNs, considering the loss of demand due to firm disruptions. Our work could be used as a benchmark for any future analyses of SCNs. © 2018 Supun S. Perera et al.

The construct was then tested empirically using the sample of 200 Polish companies. Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) were based on a structured questionnaire, then, data exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed. The conducted EFA determined four main factors for information management and integration in the supply chain that should be considered, namely, information characteristics, ICT used in information management, the scope of information and shared performance metrics. Results confirmed the importance of some of the factors related to information management in the supply chain, however having a different set of variables than indicated in the literature. Additionally, research introduced new factors, namely, information characteristics and the scope of shared information, instead of information quality and information content. Moreover, findings suggested that the key role in supply chain information integration was related to established technologies, focused on transport, customer, and ERP management, while emerging technologies, such as cloud computing and data mining were not of the top importance among the surveyed companies. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In most supply chains (SCs), transaction relationships between suppliers and customers are commonly considered to be an extrapolation from a linear perspective. However, this traditional linear concept of an SC is egotistic and oversimplified and does not sufficiently reflect the complex and cyclical structure of supplier-customer relationships in current economic and industrial situations. The interactional relationships and topological characteristics between suppliers and customers should be analyzed using supply networks (SNs) rather than traditional linear SCs. Therefore, this paper reconceptualizes SCs as SNs in complex adaptive systems (CAS), and presents three main contributions. First, we propose an integrated framework of CAS network by synthesizing multi-level network analysis from the network-, community- and vertex-perspective. The CAS perspective enables us to understand the advances of SN properties. Second, in order to emphasize the CAS properties of SNs, we conducted a real-world SN based on the Japanese industry and describe an advanced investigation of SN theory. The CAS properties help in enriching the SN theory, which can benefit SN management, community economics and industrial resilience. Third, we propose a quantitative metric of entropy to measure the complexity and robustness of SNs. The results not only support a specific understanding of the structural outcomes relevant to SNs, but also deliver efficient and effective support to the management and design of SNs. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to assess the integration status and associated weaknesses of informal rice milling industry in Bangladesh, and explores the achievable benefits through reorientation of the informal rice industry into integrated and specialised rice industry zone(s) (SRIZ). The study investigates the feasible integrated development of rice and paddy/rice oriented supplementary industries through clustering and grouping into SRIZ. Furthermore, it identifies new opportunities in terms of business, technology up gradation, product diversification, industry sustainability, standardisation and food security in an otherwise traditional rice supply chain of Bangladesh and similar other rice producing developing countries. Both structured and semi-structured questionnaire survey have been conducted to know the detail characteristics of sporadically developed rice manufacturing industry in various parts of Bangladesh. Using proposed integration evaluation criteria, rice supply chain integration status is evaluated along with identification of associated problems due to current poor integration situation. Analysis of endogenous and exogenous shortcomings of informal rice mills system in Bangladesh engenders solution mechanisms through promotion of integration, clustering and specialised zoning of rice mills. The findings of this research will be useful both for policy makers and agribusiness researchers in rice-producing countries, especially, which have informal setup of rapidly growing rice mills.

	abstract = {In the last decade, as an emerging technique for business processes management, process mining (PM) has been applied in many domains, including manufacturing, supply-chain, government, healthcare, and software engineering. Particularly in healthcare, where most processes are complex, variable, dynamic, and multi-disciplinary in nature, the application of this technique is growing yet challenging. Several literature reviews, as secondary studies, reveal the state of PM applications in healthcare from different perspectives, such as clinical pathways, oncology processes, and hospital management. In this article, we present the results of a systematic mapping (SM) study which we conducted to structure the information available in the primary studies. SM is a well-accepted method to identify and categorize research literature, in which the number of primary studies is rapidly growing. We searched for studies between 2005 and 2017 in the electronic digital libraries of scientific literature, and identified 172 studies out of the 2428 initially found on the topic of PM in healthcare. We created a concept map based on the information provided by the primary studies and classified these studies according to a number of attributes including the types of research and contribution, application context, healthcare specialty, mining activity, process modeling type and notation/language, and mining algorithm. We also reported the demographics and bibliometrics trends in this domain; namely, publication volume, top-cited papers, most contributing researchers and countries, and top venues. The results of mapping showed that, despite the healthcare data and technique related challenges, the field is rapidly growing and open for further research and practice. The researchers who are interested in the field could use the results to elicit opportunities for further research. The practitioners who are considering applications of PM, on the other hand, could observe the most common aims and specialties that PM techniques are applied. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The continuously growing amount of available data has accelerated the emergence of numerous business intelligence applications that are summarized under the term Big Data Analytics (BDA). BDA is especially relevant to the domain of Supply Chain Management (SCM) as it provides the tools to support decision-making in increasingly global, volatile and dynamic value networks. However, its application challenges traditional institutional arrangements as well as roles that are related to the management of data. The underlying empirical study addresses this challenge with the application of a multi-method approach that is embedded in Organizational Information Processing Theory (OIPT). A Delphi survey was conducted to integrate expert assessments of projections up to the year 2035 and fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to identify future scenarios that span the future of BDA in SCM. The study suggests that BDA will improve demand forecasts, reduce safety stocks and improve the management of supplier performance. However, supply chain (SC) processes will become increasingly automated and traditional tasks of SCM will be partially substituted as a result. Consequently, the transition of the traditional role of SCM within organizations will increase the importance of human intuition, trust and strategic decision-making. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {A set of coupled semantic data models, i.e., ontologies, are presented to advance a methodology toward automated inventory modeling of chemical manufacturing in life cycle assessment. The cradle-to-gate life cycle inventory for chemical manufacturing is a detailed collection of the material and energy flows associated with a chemical's supply chain. Thus, there is a need to manage data describing both the lineage (or synthesis pathway) and processing conditions for a chemical. To this end, a Lineage ontology is proposed to reveal all the synthesis steps required to produce a chemical from raw materials, such as crude oil or biomaterials, while a Process ontology is developed to manage data describing the various unit processes associated with each synthesis step. The two ontologies are coupled such that process data, which is the basis for inventory modeling, is linked to lineage data through key concepts like the chemical reaction and reaction participants. To facilitate automated inventory modeling, a series of SPARQL queries, based on the concepts of ancestor and parent, are presented to generate a lineage for a chemical of interest from a set of reaction data. The proposed ontologies and SPARQL queries are evaluated and tested using a case study of nylon-6 production. Once a lineage is established, the process ontology can be used to guide inventory modeling based on both data mining (top-down) and simulation (bottom-up) approaches. The ability to generate a cradle-to-gate life cycle for a chemical represents a key achievement toward the ultimate goal of automated life cycle inventory modeling. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

However, actual completion time always deviated from the standard completion time due to unavoidable factors and consequently affect delivery due date and ultimately lead to customer dissatisfaction. Besides, it is found that little attention has been given in analysing completion time at production line from previous literatures. Therefore, this paper fill the knowledge gap by predicting completion time based on historical data of production line activities and discovers the most influential factor that contributes to the tardiness or a late job's due date from its completion time. A wellknown company in producing audio speaker is selected as a case company. Based on the review of previous works, it is found that Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has superior capability in prediction of future occurrence by capturing the underlying relationship among variables through historical data. Besides, ANN is also capable to provide final weight for each of related variable. Variable with the highest value of final weight indicates the most influential variable and should be concerned more to solve completion time issue which has persisted among entities in supply chain system. The obtained result is expected to become an advantageous guidance for every entity in supply chain system to fulfil completion time requirement as requested by customer in order to survive in this turbulent market place. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

This study proposes a real-time monitoring system that utilizes smartphone-based sensors and a big data platform. Firstly, we develop a smartphone-based sensor to gather temperature, humidity, GPS, and image data. The IoT-generated sensor on the smartphone has characteristics such as a large amount of storage, an unstructured format, and continuous data generation. Thus, in this study, we propose an effective big data platform design to handle IoT-generated sensor data. Furthermore, the abnormal sensor data generated by failed sensors is called outliers and may arise in real cases. The proposed system utilizes outlier detection based on statistical and clustering approaches to filter out the outlier data. The proposed system was evaluated for system and gateway performance and tested on the kimchi supply chain in Korea. The results showed that the proposed system is capable of processing a massive input/output of sensor data efficiently when the number of sensors and clients increases. The current commercial smartphones are sufficiently capable of combining their normal operations with simultaneous performance as gateways for transmitting sensor data to the server. In addition, the outlier detection based on the 3-sigma and DBSCAN were used to successfully detect/classify outlier data as separate from normal sensor data. This study is expected to help those who are responsible for developing the real-time monitoring system and implementing critical strategies related to the perishable supply chain. © 2017 by the authors.},

Results show that the relationships among supply chain collaboration value innovation, supply chain capacity and competitive advantage can have a positive impact, and that supply chain capability is a full mediator. Moreover, supply chain echelons (upper, middle and downstream) have some moderating effects in these relationships. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Today universities face a very competitive arena and the stakeholders’ engagement and satisfaction, they are both essential in order to gain and consolidate the competitive advantage. The entrepreneurial engagement involves, first of all, work placements. The entrepreneurial engagement and satisfaction can be investigated through questionnaires, interviews and, if the satisfaction is high, the advocacy for the university can imply sponsorships and partnerships for research. Relationship marketing becomes a priority in order to manage relationships with stakeholders and to create a competitive edge for the university. The entrepreneurial engagement is evident in all above-mentioned practices in tourism curricula in the Italian university. The aim of the paper is cluster analysis of satisfaction of 100 entrepreneurs of the tourism industry who supplied stages for a Milan University students in 2013 and 2014. These entrepreneurs replied to questionnaires, so that they revealed their satisfaction for students. K-means clustering gave evidence to the diversification of the supply chain and to entrepreneurs’ satisfaction about students’ knowledge, relationship skills, willingness-to-learn and overall satisfaction. The most crowded cluster includes hotels, travel agencies, administrations and not-for-profits. This cluster signals the highest satisfaction of work placement-tutors. © 2016, Eurasia Business and Economics Society.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify a classification scheme which represents the variation in business and supply chain performance of supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry. Classification is done by presenting an empirical taxonomy of clusters representing supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry based on variation in supply chain excellence index (SCEI) and business performance index (BPI). Design/methodology/approach: The clustering of supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry is done by considering BPI and SCEI as clustering variables, which were found by using survey responses and results of a prior empirical study which was carried out in Indian manufacturing industry. The cluster analysis is performed by using Ward’s agglomerative hierarchical clustering followed by using K-means clustering algorithm to establish final set of clusters. Findings: It was found that supply chains in Indian manufacturing industries can be clustered in four major clusters which are named as strategic, celebrity, capable and undeveloped cluster. The characteristics of these clusters reveal some major characteristics of supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry. Originality/value: The research work presented in this paper takes a novel way to introduce the clusters of supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry. The researchers who are seeking patterns in large data sets of manufacturing companies of Indian industry will be benefitted by using the proposed clusters. While practitioners who are seeking to move their supply chain one step ahead will also reap the benefits of the paper by seeking the characteristics of particular cluster. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Missing sensor data may occur in real cases, as sensor data are lost or corrupted due to many reasons. The proposed system utilizes data mining techniques to predict missing sensor data. The proposed system was tested for kimchi supply chain in Korea, and showed significant benefit to managers as well as customers by providing real-time location as well as complete temperature and humidity history. The multilayer perceptron model provided the best prediction accuracy for missing sensor data compared to other models.

However, the model is essentially defined on the problem of supplier selection, it can be used to deal with almost any similar decision making problem. This novel Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) model takes the advantages of the U2P-Miner algorithm, the interval data weighting method, and the Linear Assignment Method (LAM). The key idea behind the method is to consider the attribute with more frequent patterns as the common attribute and to assign a smaller weight to it. Since, the model handles interval data as input, it can be guaranteed that the model uses the detailed information and, therefore, the resulting weight factors are more realistic. The DMs risk aversion level is also addressed in the model, which is necessary in real-life situations. Accordingly, the proposed decision making process depends directly on DMs attitude toward risk. It gives DM the opportunity to make a decision in two ways: 1) based on the specified risk aversion level, 2) based on an integrated approach using LAM. The linearity of the LAM, by itself, enhances the scalability of the model. Moreover, the necessity of providing pairwise comparison judgments is completely eliminated in the model and, therefore, the reliability of the decision making is enhanced. The effectiveness of the model is finally demonstrated through a numerical example while the broad comparative and sensitivity analysis further proves its validity and superiority. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The total output capacity is determined initially and after the production of common parts is completed as the capacity will be limited by the production of common parts when determining the output quantities of the various final products based on the updated demand forecast. Therefore, this paper considers the supply chain coordination considering retailers' default risk in trade credit.

	abstract = {The contemporary research in the area of individual technology adoption mainly focuses on commercial supply chains. However, limited research focuses on the context of humanitarian supply chains. This calls to develop structural models that can scrutinize the technology adoption behaviour of the users in the humanitarian context. Therefore, this study is an attempt to empirically examine the technology adoption behaviour of humanitarian organizations. It extends the unified theory of the acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model by integrating personal innovativeness and trust in technology with the behavioural intention to adopt technology in the humanitarian context. Data from 192 humanitarian practitioners, who have experienced a large number of disasters, is utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model. The structural equation modelling results show that - out of four constructs namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions under UTAUT - performance expectancy and effort expectancy significantly affect the IT adoption. Contrary to expectations, trust and personal innovation do not affect the behavioural intention. Also, personal innovation does not moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and effort expectancy. This underlines the need to foster a learning culture within these organizations. The efforts made by involved humanitarian organizations may be directed towards improving the level of education, skills and facilitating them with other resources such as appropriate IT and data mining training, so that the technology adoption becomes an integral part of their daily activities. Finally, detailed implications for humanitarian organizations are discussed. © 2017},

An optimal location of facilities in relation to the capacity of supply and demand, allows a high level service to attend the markets. In this paper, a methodological framework for designing supply networks by joining application of clustering techniques and mathematical programming are presented. The proposed methodology has been tested with real data obtained from a company of non-alcoholic beverages in Colombia. The approach considers three main stages. First, the costumers clustering process is performed by K-means in order to obtain the location for potential Distribution Centers (DC's). In the second stage, the model for supply network design is performed using a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) by considering different options to assign DC's, and finally the valuation of the proposed methodology on a real case. A distribution scheme, which allows enter to new market areas with an efficient strategy to penetrate products to big cities such as Bogotá in Colombia, was found. © 2017 IJIEM Journal.},

	abstract = {In a single supply chain scenario, orders are likely to be refused for lack of insufficient capacity and production time. In this paper, cluster supply chains (a kind of multiple supply chains, short for CSC) is introduced to avoid this potential operational risk via across-chain cooperation, which is not considered in any previous work. First, the framework of order selection in cluster supply chain (CSC) is presented based on four order categories (direct order, reserve order, across-chain order and rejected order), followed by that the model without and with across-chain cooperation in cluster supply chains are proposed to aid operational managers to make joint decision regarding order acceptance and scheduling under maximizing the overall profit. Considering the complexity of cluster supply chains structure and a mass of data from actual operations, a parallel Lagrange heuristic algorithm is devised to solve the Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Program (MINLP) problem. Meanwhile, Benders algorithm is utilized to compare with it for evaluating performance. The result proves the parallel Lagrange heuristic algorithm outperforms Benders approach, the former can efficiently solve large-scale-data problem instances at relatively short time. The outcomes also reveal that, by designing the different combination of the factor of rejected order and that of across-chain order, it can be better trade-off between order due-date and cost while better aligning with the long-term business strategy in cluster supply chains. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Distribution centres (DCs) are the hubs connecting transport streams in the supply chain. The synchronisation of coming and going cargo at a DC requires reliable arrival times. To achieve this, a reliable method to predict arrival times is needed. A literature review was performed to find the factors that are reported to predict arrival time: congestion, weather, time of day and incidents. While travel time receives considerable attention, there is a gap in literature concerning arrival vs. travel/journey time prediction. None of the reviewed papers investigate arrival time: all the papers found investigate travel time. Arrival time is the consequence of travel time in combination with departure time, so though the travel time literature is applicable, the human factor involved in planning the time of departure can affect the arrival time (especially for truck drivers who have travelled the same route before). To validate the factors that influence arrival time, the authors conducted a detailed case study that includes a survey of 230 truckers, a data analysis and a data mining experiment, using real traffic and weather data. These show that although a ‘big data’ approach delivers valuable insights, the predictive power is not as high as expected; other factors, such as human or organisational factors, could influence arrival time, and it is concluded that such organisational factors should be considered in future predictive models. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The analysis applies spatial statistical techniques to detect spatial agglomerations of different industrial sectors related to the AI. The findings include a detailed description of the spatial distribution of AI co-location patterns in terms of industrial branch and firm size. Results indicate that the AI industry is mainly spatially co-located by itself and by industries in the electronics, machinery and equipment sectors.

This problem is very challenging for application-oriented data supply chains because the high complexity of the data supply chain makes the computation of similarity extremely complex and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a feature space representation model based on key points, which can extract the key features from the subsequences of the original data supply chain and simplify it into a feature vector form. Then, we formulate the similarity computation of the subsequences based on the multiscale features. Further, we propose an improved hierarchical clustering algorithm for a similarity search over the data supply chains. The main idea is to separate the subsequences into disjoint groups such that each group meets one specific clustering criteria; thus, the cluster containing the query object is the similarity search result. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is both effective and efficient for data supply chain retrieval. © 1996-2012 Tsinghua University Press.},

The ultimate aim of supply chains is to reduce costs and increase market coverage. Procuring and purchasing requested items in a timely manner are the two most important issues for supply chain stockholders. Group purchasing is one of the purchasing strategies in supply chains. It offers great potential by ordering large volumes to decrease expenses which can increase services to customers. A clustering optimization approach is employed to model group purchasing for a set of pharmacies in the field of healthcare. The proposed model determines a cooperation strategy based on factors such as distance between pharmacies and procurement expenditure in this network. Moreover, the proposed multi-objective group purchasing model is optimized using both goal programming and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. To illustrate the application of the proposed model, designing a purchasing group organization for Chalus city pharmacies is investigated. Purchasing groups are established in the way that sum of pharmacies ordering quantity has been located in the second or the third level of discount rate. Thus, the results show that GPOs can take the advantage of this cooperation. © 2017, SBMAC - Sociedade Brasileira de Matemática Aplicada e Computacional.},

	abstract = {Food fraud results from the interaction of motivated offenders with opportunities, and lack of control measures. The vulnerability to food fraud varies across chain actors (tiers) though, but insights on prime fraud drivers and enablers, as well as chain areas where vulnerabilities might exist are lacking. In the current study the fish, meat, milk, olive oil, organic bananas, and spice supply chains were assessed for their fraud vulnerabilities. The differences and similarities in vulnerabilities across the supply chains, as well as between groups of chain actors were evaluated using the SSAFE food fraud vulnerability assessment tool. Multiple correspondence analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering were applied for exploratory data analysis, and differences between chains and actors were assessed by analysis of variance and post-hoc tests. Thirteen fraud factors related to opportunities and motivations scored high across all supply chains indicating their importance as fraud drivers and enablers. Control measures varied considerably across supply chains and actor groups, with technical (hard) controls generally being more in place than managerial (soft) controls. Approximately half of the fraud factors were impacted by the type of commodity chain, and one out of seven of the fraud factors by the actor group. From the current sample group overall fraud vulnerability appeared highest for the spice chain, which was followed by the olive oil, meat, fish, milk and organic banana chains. Among the actor groups, the wholesale/traders group appeared most vulnerable, followed by retailers and processors. The current results provide new insights in the fraud factors determining fraud vulnerability in various supply chains, and the (dis)similarities in fraud vulnerability across supply chains and actor groups which helps to combat future food fraud. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {Our study examined relationships among pellet mills, bulk delivery companies, and high-efficiency pellet boiler equipment firms in northern New England as they relate to homeowner satisfaction, using social network analysis and the concept of supply chain management. The continual growth of supply and demand for automated pellet heating requires a careful match between innovative technologies and homeowner needs; these involve multiple factors and require collaboration among firms. Using interview data with managers from pellet mills, bulk delivery companies, and equipment firms in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, we found 15 firms that are connected through both a transaction network and an informal business interaction network. The networks were characterized by short paths and no obvious sign of centralization. Network statistics reported for each network included density, clustering coefficient, and degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality. Most firms in the supply networks shared customer satisfaction information (average number of information sending ties ¼ 3) and considered collaboration in customer services important (mean ¼ 4.4, on a 5-point scale). However, equipment firms initiated more information sharing than other types, and bulk delivery companies were in the best position in the supply network to promote collaborative customer services. Opportunities exist to improve communication between pellet mills and equipment firms, leading to a robust automated pellet heating supply chain, strong demand, and subsequent homeowner satisfaction. © Forest Products Society 2018.},

	abstract = {Although mass customization, which utilizes modularization to simultaneously increase product variety and maintain mass production (MP) efficiency, has become a trend in recent times, there are some limitations to mass customization. Firstly, customers do not participate wholeheartedly in the design phase. Secondly, potential combinations are predetermined by designers. Thirdly, the concept of mass customization is not necessary to satisfy individual requirements and is not capable of providing personalized services and goods. Industry 4.0 is a collective term for technologies and concepts of value chain organization. Based on the technological concepts of radio frequency identification, cyber-physical system, the Internet of things, Internet of service, and data mining, Industry 4.0 will enable novel forms of personalization. Direct customer input to design will enable companies to increasingly produce customized products with shorter cycle-times and lower costs than those associated with standardization and MP. The producer and the customer will share in the new value created. To overcome the gaps between mass customization and mass personalization, this paper presents a framework for mass personalization production based on the concepts of Industry 4.0. Several industrial practices and a lab demonstration show how we can realize mass personalization. © 2017, Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) has been widely used for the automatic identification, tracking and tracing of goods throughout the supply chain from the manufacturer to the customer. However, one technological problem that impedes the productive and reliable use of RFID is the constraint of false positive readings, which refers to tags that are detected accidentally by the reader but not the ones of interest. This paper focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms to identify such RFID readings. A total of 11 statistical features are extracted from received signal strength (RSS) and phase rotations derived from the raw RFID data. Each of the features is highly statistically different to distinguish the false positive readings, but satisfactory classification cannot be achieved when these features are considered individually. Classifiers based on logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT) are constructed, which combine all of the extracted features to classify the RFID readings more effectively. The performance of the classifiers is evaluated in a real-world factory. Results show that SVM provides the highest accuracy of up to 95.3%. DT shows slightly better accuracy (92.85%) than LR (92.75%), while LR has the larger area under the curve (0.976) than DT (0.949). Overall, machine learning algorithms could achieve accuracy of 93% on average. The proposed methodology provides a much more reliable RFID application as false-positive readings are detected immediately without human intervention, which enables a significant potential of fully automatic identification and tracking of goods throughout the supply chain. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper presents a computational literature review of the field from 1974 to 2017. A CLR automates the analysis of research articles with analysis of content (topic modelling of abstracts) to identify emergent themes in the literature. We performed a broad review of the field by initially searching using the term “System Dynamics” with more than 8000 articles. However, the results obtained were not satisfactory so we decided to restrict our sample to less than 800 articles from recognised journals and proceedings. After evaluation of the results obtained from topic modelling, we decided to use 51 topics covering most of the articles in our sample. A list of 51 topics provides enough granularity to identify relevant patterns of activity within the community of System Dynamics scholars. For each of these 51 topics, we present a commentary on the key insights obtained. © 2018 Operational Research Society.},

The analysis involves the country, sector and country-sector value chain networks to identify main drivers of structural change. The results indicate significant intertemporal changes, mirroring the increased globalization in terms of network size, strength and connectivity. They also demonstrate higher clustering and increased concentration of the most influential countries and country-sectors relative to all others in the GVC network, with the geographical dimension to prevail over the sectoral dimension in the formation of value chains. The regionalization and less hierarchical organization drive country-sector production sharing, while the sectoral value chain network has become more integrated and more competitive over time. The findings suggest that the impact of country-sector policies and/or shocks may vary with the own-group and network-wide influence of each country, take place in multiple geographical scales, as GVCs have a block structure, and involve time dynamics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose The Internet of Things (loT) paradigm1 is permeating real-life: with technology becoming more and more mature, research is focusing on assessing the potential impact of loT on many application scenarios. Within the framework of Horizon 2020 programme, the European Union invested more than 100M€ in Large Scale Pilot initiatives, "to foster the deployment of loT solutions in Europe through integration of advanced loT technologies across the value chain": seven projects were launched in 201 7. Among them, the ACTIVAGE project2 deals with "the deployment and operation at large scale of Active & Healthy Ageing loT-based solutions and services, supporting the independent living of older adults in their living environments, and responding to real needs of caregivers, service providers and public authorities." The ACTIVAGE project is currently exploring heterogeneous loT solutions for AHA over 9 different European Deployment Sites (DS), in an interoperable network. In this work, we present main features of the DS-RER experimentation, being implemented in the Emilia-Romagna Region (RER, Italy) and mostly aimed at effectively embedding loT-enabled solutions within the actual organization and practices of the regional social- and health-care services, to support users over 65 suffering post stroke conditions. Method Continuous monitoring of home activity is exploited to support independent living at home. Health-related information comes from mixing direct and indirect sources: direct information includes bodyweight and drugs assumption monitoring, assessed through smart, networked devices. Indirect information comes from tracking daily living activities by means of wireless sensors deployed into the home environment (sensing room presence, bed occupancy, toilet usage, etc.). An artificial-reasoning layer, based on machine-learning techniques is implemented to provide interpretation of behavioural data. The overall system architecture is sketched in Figure 1. At user's home, a set of sensors that exploit Wi-Fi WLAN protocol is deployed, and straightforwardly connected to the cloud environment3. The ACTIVAGE platform is embedded into the general service platform which provides the regional healthcare system with the management of electronic health records and booking of medical examinations. Data security therefore follows the strict regulations coming from such sectors. Privacy and ethical concerns are accounted for, in compliance with European and National regulations. The local platform then feeds anonymized data to the data analytics engine, based on IBM Bluemix cloud services and on the Watson Al platform, which converts raw sensor data into meaningful knowledge, e.g., information such as activity trends and anomaly detection are automatically worked out. Such knowledge is eventually fed back to the end-users (the older adult, caregivers, care- and case-managers), by means of differentiated interaction strategies. Results & Discussion Pilot tests (starting in early 2018, following a technical assessment phase) target mildly frail 65+ older adults still able to live almost independently. Although the scope is much wider, the current pilot will focus on persons suffering from post-stroke conditions to provide a homogeneous and well-characterized sample. A randomized controlled trial is being conducted, aimed at evaluating the impact of continuous monitoring in improving treatment (e.g., by reducing the re-hospitalization rate). A total population of 200 patients is going to be recruited and split into two equiponderant (active and control) sets. Besides his own caregiver(s), each patient is associated to a care-manager, who according to the hierarchical architecture of the regional healthcare system, connects patients to GP and specialists, if needed. The behavioural knowledge coming from data analytics is exploited to make caregiving more effective (e.g., by prioritizing care intervention) and for early assessment of symptoms requiring medical attention (e.g., alteration in circadian rhythms). © 2018.

Further analysis of the rhetoric in Chief executive officer (CEO) letters within sustainability reports is used to determine firms' resoluteness, positive entailments, sharing of values, perception of reality, and sustainability strategy and execution feasibility. Computer-based content analysis is used for this research: Leximancer is applied for text analysis, while dictionary-based text mining program DICTION and SPSS are used for rhetorical analysis. Overall, contents similar to the literature on environmental, social, and economic aspects of the triple bottom line (TBL) are observed, however, topics such as regulation, green incentives, and international standards are not readily observed. Furthmore, ethical issues, sustainable production, quality, and customer roles are emphasized in texts analyzed. The CEO letter analysis indicates that listed firms show relatively low realism and high commonality, while North American firms exhibit relatively high commonality, and Europe firms show relatively high realism. The results will serve as a baseline for providing academia guidelines in SSCM research, and provide an opportunity for businesses to complement their sustainability strategies and executions. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In order to improve the management and to better locate water losses, Water Distribution Networks can be physically divided into District Meter Areas (DMAs), inserting hydraulic devices on proper pipes and thus simplifying the control of water budget and pressure regime. Traditionally, the water network division is based on empirical suggestions and on ‘trial and error’ approaches, checking results step by step through hydraulic simulation, and so making it very difficult to apply such approaches to large networks. Recently, some heuristic procedures, based on graph and network theory, have shown that it is possible to automatically identify optimal solutions in terms of number, shape and dimension of DMAs. In this paper, weighted spectral clustering methods have been used to define the optimal layout of districts in a real water distribution system, taking into account both geometric and hydraulic features, through weighted adjacency matrices. The obtained results confirm the feasibility of the use of spectral clustering to address the arduous problem of water supply network partitioning with an elegant mathematical approach compared to other heuristic procedures proposed in the literature. A comparison between different spectral clustering solutions has been carried out through topological and energy performance indices, in order to identify the optimal water network partitioning procedure. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {There is a widespread myth and rhetoric, even in academic discourse, about data and VOD recommender systems, especially with regard to the notion of automation and the innocence of this presumed automation. Behind this rhetoric lies the de-humanization of machine computation, i.e. the removal of all the processual, decisional, ‘oriented’ aspects informing every online recommender system. This essay focuses on content-to-content video recommendations, which are based on patterns of similarity between different contents, and it intends to show that there is nothing neutral — even in the most seemingly ‘objective’ form of video recommendation. The aim is to rediscover those very processual elements of the ‘data supply chain’ — regarding how metadata are created and collected, and how algorithms are configured — so as to make them critically observable again: the funnels, decision points, the multiple layers of human mediation and filtering, in both their relevance and sensitivity. © 2017, Mimesis International.

	abstract = {Based on the connection mechanism of nodes which automatically select upstream and downstream agents, a simulation model for dynamic evolutionary process of consumer-driven automobile supply chain is established by integrating ABM and discrete modeling in the GIS-based map. Firstly, the rationality is proved by analyzing the consistency of sales and changes in various agent parameters between the simulation model and a real automobile supply chain. Second, through complex network theory, hierarchical structures of the model and relationships of networks at different levels are analyzed to calculate various characteristic parameters such as mean distance, mean clustering coefficients, and degree distributions. By doing so, it verifies that the model is a typical scale-free network and small-world network. Finally, the motion law of this model is analyzed from the perspective of complex self-adaptive systems. The chaotic state of the simulation system is verified, which suggests that this system has typical nonlinear characteristics. This model not only macroscopically illustrates the dynamic evolution of complex networks of automobile supply chain but also microcosmically reflects the business process of each agent. Moreover, the model construction and simulation of the system by means of combining CAS theory and complex networks supplies a novel method for supply chain analysis, as well as theory bases and experience for supply chain analysis of auto companies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The article investigates the factors that make businesses postpone integrating the performance dimension of sustainability in global agrifood supply chains. Based on literature-based conceptual reasoning, the article conceptualizes a double company lens distinguishing between substantial supply chain management and mere public relations endeavors as a major obstacle for businesses pursuing comprehensive supply chain performance in global agrifood chains. We point out that many supply chain performance attributes represent, in fact, credence attributes that cannot be verified by the consumer, hence entailing an information asymmetry between the company and its consumers. Rational business responses to this situation tend to focus on symbolic actions and communication efforts by means of sustainability reports and other brand-enhancing marketing tools that may be decoupled from substantial operations and supply chain improvements. The research propositions developed have partly been corroborated by a content analysis of annual and sustainability reports of four major agrifood companies (Nestlé, PepsiCo, Unilever, and Mondelez International). The conceptual arguments and empirical analysis presented in the article may serve as the basis for managers and academics to develop innovative inter- and intraorganizational business processes that reconcile trade-offs between various agrifood supply chain performance dimensions, thus pushing the performance frontier outward, and that provide the necessary transparency for overcoming the currently adverse setting of incentives inherent in the food production, processing, retailing, and consumption system. © 2016 by Yale University},

	abstract = {Through the supply chain, the quality or quality change of the products can generate important losses. The quality control in some steps is made manually that supposes a high level of subjectivity, controlling the quality and its evolution using automatic systems can suppose a reduction of the losses. Testing some automatic image analysis techniques in the case of tomatoes and zucchini is the main objective of this paper. Two steps in the supply chain are considered, the feeding of the raw products into the handling chain (because low quality generates a reduction of the chain productivity) and the cool storage of the processed products (as the value at the market is reduced). It was proposed to analyze the incoming products at the head the processing line using CCD cameras to detect low quality and/or dirty products (corresponding to specific farmers/suppliers, it should be asked to improve to maintain the productivity of the line). The second stage is analyzing the evolution of the products along the cool chain (storage and transport), the use of an App developed to be use under Android was proposed to substitute the “visual” evaluation used in practice. The algorithms used, including stages of pre-treatment, segmentation, analysis and presentation of the results take account of the short time available and the limited capacity of the batteries. High performance techniques were applied to the homography stage to discard some of the images, resulting in better performance. Also threads and renderscript kernels were created to parallelize the methods used on the resulting images being able to inspect faster the products. The proposed method achieves success rates comparable to, and improving, the expert inspection. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All rights reserved.},

Design/methodology/approach: What the authors mainly applied is using surrogate instead of specific roles or actors’ name in reviews to make reviews more generic. Besides, feature selection techniques and different kinds of classifiers are incorporated. Findings: With roles’ and actors’ names replaced by generic tags, the experimental result showed that it can generalize well to agnostic TV series as compared with reviews keeping the original names. Research limitations/implications: The model presented in this paper must be built on top of an already existed knowledge base like Baidu Encyclopedia. Such database takes lots of work. Practical implications: Like in digital information supply chain, if reviews are part of the information to be transported or exchanged, then the model presented in this paper can help automatically identify individual review according to different requirements and help the information sharing. Originality/value: One originality is that the authors proposed the surrogate-based approach to make reviews more generic. Besides, they also built a review data set of hot Chinese TV series, which includes eight generic category labels for each review. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Climate change is at the top of the agenda recently which makes resource efficiency to come under discussion. This paper aims at analyzing circular economy and looking for possibilities to connect business and science so that innovative technologies and products are developed to increase SMEs' resource efficiency through clusters and cluster organizations. Bibliometric literature analysis technique was chosen to qualify circular economy, resource efficiency and clusters, as well as to detect the evidence that clusters can be enablers of resource efficiency and circular economy between SMEs; indicators are introduced to detect these linkages. The findings suggest that the principles of circular economy can be detected between companies within a cluster and resource efficient actions may arise from close cooperation, knowledge transfer, innovative solutions and competitive advantages which are imparted by the cluster. This study needs to be continued to implicate these indicators to test how close cooperation and other advantages that companies can obtain from belonging to a cluster can affect their engagement in circular economy and resource efficiency. These benefits can be used in further development of circular value chains within a cluster . © 2014-2019 Terra Economicus.; Кластеры чаще рассматриваются не только как одно из средств достижения конкурентного преимущества малыми и средними предприятиями (МСП) посредством кластеризации, но и как связующее звено, позволяющее сосредоточиться на проблемах ресурсоэффективности и налаживать циркулярные цепочки создания ценности.

	abstract = {Recent literature suggests that to make value chains in changing agrifood systems in sub-Saharan Africa more inclusive, intermediary institutions should foster coordination. The hub concept has been applied as such an intermediary institution that coordinates advisory services, input supply and smallholder access to markets. This study unravels hub coordination in smallholder dairy in Kenya, conceptualising the hub as a mix between a broker of relationships, a one-stop-shop for services and a cluster of producers and service providers, enabling horizontal coordination (between smallholders) and vertical coordination (between smallholders and value chain actors and service providers). Findings indicate that, in resolving challenges that limit smallholders' integration in value chains, synergies emerged as the hub combined different types of horizontal and vertical coordination. This was done by simultaneously organising clusters of farmers and input and service providers (clustering role) and actively facilitating delivery (broker and one-stop-shop role), where the hub structure stimulated the matching of demand (better articulation) to supply (better organised access). However, tensions emerged in the combination of horizontal and vertical coordination as farmer organisations as hub operators had to balance a role as an honest broker between farmers with the intent of enhancing collective action and as a business-oriented entity which resulted in the exclusion of some farmers who cannot deliver the quantity and quality required to minimise coordination costs. Given these tensions and capacity problems of farmers' organisations, complementary intermediary arrangements may be necessary to fulfil some coordination roles. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {Optimization of the supply chain relates on data that describes actual or future situation. Besides in many situations available data may not correspond directly to what is expected for the different models because of too large quantity and imprecision of the data that may lead to suboptimal or even bad decisions. Actual problem considers the availability of a large and noisy dataset concerning historical information about each customer that will be used to make improved prediction models, that may fit models to optimize the supply chain. When dealing with large datasets, market segmentation is frequently employed in business forecasting; many customers are grouped based on some measure of similarity. Segment-level forecasting is then employed to represent the population within each segment. Challenges with successfully applying market segmentation include how to create segments when descriptive customer information is lacking and how to apply the segment-level demand forecasts to individual customers. This research proposes a method to create customer segments based on noisy historical transaction data, create segment-level forecasts, and then apply the forecasts to individual customers. The proposed method utilizes existing data mining and forecasting tools, but applies them in a unique combination that results in a higher level of customer-level forecast accuracy than other traditional methods. The proposed forecasting method has significant management applications in any domain where forecasts are needed for a large population of customers and the only available data is delivery data. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the publication industry, three business strategies are commonly observed, namely the subscription-based strategy, ad-sponsored strategy, and mixed strategy. In order to obtain managerial insights into the three business strategies, we consider a supply chain in which a publisher sells a product such as newspaper and magazine to end-customers. Furthermore, the publisher may also sell advertisement space to advertisers. In such a supply chain, the publisher determines the optimal business strategy and corresponding prices and fees; the advertisers determine the amount of advertisement space to purchase from the publisher. We formulate a game-theory model of the above advertising service supply chain. Under this model, we first characterize each firm's equilibrium decisions under each business strategy. We then compare the publisher's profit under the three strategies to determine the publisher's optimal strategy. We show that when the fixed cost of the mixed strategy is sufficiently low, it is optimal for the publisher to adopt the mixed strategy irrespective of the number of advertisers. If the fixed cost of the mixed strategy is high, it is optimal for the publisher to adopt either the subscription-based or ad-sponsored strategy, depending on the other parameters' values. However, advertisers do not always obtain their highest profits under the publisher's optimal strategy. We show regions where the publisher and advertisers have conflicting incentives. Both the fixed cost of the mixed strategy and the number of advertisers turn out to be key factors that lead to incentive conflicts in the supply chain. © 2017 The Operational Research Society.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, Product-Service System (PSS) has been established as a prominent business model which promises sustainability. A great amount of literature work has been devoted to PSS issues, but there is fairly limited published work on integrated and easily applicable evaluation methodologies for PSS design, as well as a lack of Lean PSS approaches. Contributing to these directions, the present work introduces a framework for the evaluation and improvement of the Lean PSS design using key performance indicators (KPIs), Lean rules, and sentiment analysis, aiming to feed all the stages of PSS design lifecycle. According to the evaluation phase, a certain appropriate set of KPIs is selected and suggested to the PSS designer via a context-sensitivity analysis (CSA) tool through a pool, which have been identified after intensive literature survey, and systematically classified into five main categories: design, manufacturing, customer, environment, and sustainability. According to the same phase, sentiment analysis has been used to identify the polarity of the customer opinions regarding the PSS offerings. During the phase of Lean design assistance, Lean rules are selected using CSA and are suggested to the designer to ensure the minimization of wasteful activities. Enabler for the context awareness is the availability of feedback gathered from the manufacturing, shop-floor experts, and the different types of customers (business or final-product consumers), as well as the PSS lifecycle which the designer treats. The proposed framework is implemented in a software prototype and is applied in a mold-making industrial case study. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.},

The relationships between Supply Chain Management (SCM) and ICs have been imperfectly mathematically investigated, in spite of their intrinsic correlation. To bridge this gap, a bi-objective multi-echelon supply-distribution model is firstly proposed in this paper to optimize collaborations of different echelons. The considered problem is then solved using a recently introduced metaheuristic algorithm, the intelligent water drops (IWD) algorithm in terms of a multi-objective approach. The IWD is then compared with two well-known algorithms, reference-point based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) and non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA). The two considered objectives are 1) minimizing the total incurred logistics costs, and 2) maximizing the service level of customers. The small-and-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) positioned in IC as manufacturers profit from using a 3PL-managed supply-demand hub in industrial cluster (SDHIC) as a public provider of warehousing and logistics services. The validity of the proposed approach is illustrated through experimental results including comprehensive statistical analysis on the three used measurement metrics. © 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

A co-citation unit is used to analyze the relationship between cited documents, and then science mapping is used to identify clusters in this relationship. The results show that there are four main distinct clusters, of which the most important concerns sustainable supply chains and logistics management. This cluster is then classified into five bunches of knowledge sources. These bunches illustrate the need for a trend in sustainability issues that includes a social dimension to balance economic and environmental dimensions for long-term development. There are logistics management and lean concepts that can be applied to sustainable development to move toward business sustainability. The future direction of sustainable business concerns economic values, environmental policy and stakeholder engagement for business opportunities.

Suppliers of a company in the heavy-machinery sector are assessed based on 17 qualitative and quantitative risk types. The weights of the criteria are determined by using the Best-Worst method. Four factors are extracted by applying Factor Analysis to the supplier risk data. Then k-means clustering algorithm is applied to group core suppliers of the company based on the four risk factors. Three clusters are created with different risk exposure levels. The interpretation of the results provides insights for risk management actions and supplier development programs to mitigate supplier risk. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important food security crop or resource for poor rural communities particularly in Africa. The crop’s ability to produce high yields even under poor conditions and storability of its roots underground for longer periods or until needed makes it a model ‘food security crop’. In Benin Republic, cassava has been recognized as one of the major crop contributing towards dynamic value chains generating incomes for small-holder farmers. The crop is grown all over the country, however, the increased production are mainly recorded from far south and central parts of the country. Genetic improvement of cassava in Benin Republic is limited because of poor knowledge of genetic diversity present within the country. The main objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and relationships among elite cassava varieties collected from different regions of Benin using fluorescently labelled simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and to compare the results with farmer’s knowledge and morphological traits. A total of 96 cultivars collected from major cassava growing areas such as Southern and Central Benin were classified into 24 different groups using farmers’ knowledge, while classification based on 18 morphological traits resulted in five groups. In total, sixteen SSR markers were tested for molecular analysis of the ninety-six cassava varieties. Among the sixteen, twelve SSR markers gave good banding pattern and were used to genotype the varieties. An average of 3.58 and 0.47 for number of alleles and polymorphism information content respectively was observed. The observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.23 to 1.0 with an average of 0.66 indicating moderate level of diversity among the cultivars. Based on the proportion of shared alleles and hierarchical clustering, the 96 elite cassava varieties were classified as 74 unique varieties. Principal component analysis and analysis of molecular variance revealed no significant variation between the regions thus, explaining regular exchange of planting materials among cassava farmers across various regions. The moderate level of genetic diversity in famer’s field, revealed in the present study, is a good indication of the need for broadening the genetic base of cassava in Benin Republic and establishing a formal breeding program in the country. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Considering the concern with regard to quality sustainability in food supply chain, many companies have developed a real time data monitoring system to ensure products quality in the supply chain network. In this paper, we proposed a food safety pre-warning system, adopting association rule mining and Internet of Things technology, to timely monitor all the detection data of the whole supply chain and automatically pre-warn. The aim of pre-warning system is to help managers in food manufacturing firm to find food safety risk in advance, and to give some decision support information to maintain the quality and safety of food products. A case study of a dairy producer was conducted, and the results showed that the proposed pre-warning system can effectively identify safety risks and accurately determine whether a warning should be issued, depending on the expert analysis when an abnormality is detected by the system. In addition, implications of the proposed approach were discussed, and suggestions for future work were outlined. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

We found that the supply chain includes many data samples collected from the first supplier to the last customer, which have to be analysed by the company in order to be more efficient. Based on these observations the authors argue for why it makes sense to see the BI function as an extension of supply chain management, but moreover they show how difficult it has become to separate BI from other IT intensive processes in the organization.},

	abstract = {As thriving and fast-moving technologies, recommender systems have been widely adopted by online retailers to increase their sales recently. This has significant impacts on the stakeholders in the online supply chain. How an online retailer uses recommender systems to maximise its profit through choosing different recommendation strategies for two upstream competing manufacturers is explored in this paper. In particular, a game between one online retailer and two competitive manufacturers is constructed in which these manufacturers can be selectively and strategically recommended by the retailer. The analytical results show that as the recommendation strength of recommender systems increases, neither manufacturers nor the retailer can always enjoy higher profits, which is counterintuitive. Furthermore, this study reveals that (i) a recommended manufacturer may enjoy a higher profit through sharing the recommendation market with its rival than through monopolising this market; (ii) recommending two manufacturers in both is the most feasible way for the online retailer to benefit from controlling the supply chain. Finally, it is interesting that recommender systems are found to be good mechanisms to help to coordinate the online supply chain with one retailer and two manufacturers because the recommendation market generated by recommender systems alleviates channel conflict. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Urban water supply network is ubiquitous and indispensable to city dwellers, especially in the era of global urbanization. Preventative maintenance of water pipes, especially in urban-scale networks, thus becomes a vital importance. To achieve this goal, failure prediction that aims to pro-actively pinpoint those 'most-risky-to-fail' pipes becomes critical and has been attracting wide attention from government, academia, and industry. Different from classification-, regression-, or ranking-based methods, this paper adopts a point process-based framework that incorporates both the past failure event data and individual pipe-specific profile including physical, environmental, and operational covariants. In particular, based on a common wisdom of previous work that the failure event sequences typically exhibit temporal clustering distribution, we use mutual-exciting point process to model such triggering effects for different failure types. Our system is deployed as a platform commissioned by the water agency in a metropolitan city in Asia, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on an urban-scale pipe network. Our model is generic and thus can be applied to other industrial scenarios for event prediction. © 2013 IEEE.},

This study uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict container flows by considering GDP, interest rates, the value of export and import trade, the numbers of export and import containers and the number of quay cranes. ANNs are developed for data mining purposes, and the developed model can simultaneously predict container flows between the major ports of Asia. The forecasting results indicate that the prediction errors are relatively small in most selected ports, and thus shipping companies can use the container flow prediction model to make decisions concerning operations. The results can be further applied to the trend analysis of container flows among the major ports of Asia, and a community analysis of the containers was conducted for the purpose of supply chain management. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Transportation and logistics are increasingly relevant to the rapid economic growth of emerging economies. Decision makers in the transportation and logistics industry require a comprehensive understanding of the institutional business environment and factor markets in emerging economy countries to formulate accurate supply chain strategies for the future. Although extensive studies on prospective scenarios in emerging economies are available, research has largely neglected the future evolution of transportation and logistics. This study addresses this gap by applying a multiple method research approach and relying on institutional theory and factor-market rivalry theory to create scenarios of the development of transportation and logistics in emerging economy countries by 2030. We do so by collecting qualitative and quantitative data through a Delphi survey and applying fuzzy clustering to group the results into meaningful and interpretable scenarios. Our results suggest that emerging economies will take advantage of free trade zones to consolidate their position in the international market and encourage investment. Consequently, logistics will experience rapid growth and value-added services will expand, propelling new players from developing economies onto the international stage. Our findings also suggest that the logistics service industry in emerging economy countries will undergo a significant consolidation process, leading to the possibility of factor-market rivalry among shippers. This suggests that shippers' social networks and personal contacts will increase in importance in the future. © 2015 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.},

Then we perform the experiments on the dataset of China automobile supply network. Two evaluation methods are introduced to evaluate the results of enterprise rank. One method is based on the reliable public enterprise rank data, and another is to compare the results of clustering according to the enterprise rank.

	abstract = {Increasing complexity in manufacturing companies has been one of the biggest issues during the last years. Companies in high-technology marketplaces are confronted with technology innovation, dynamic environmental conditions, changing customer requirements, globalization of markets and competitions as well as market uncertainty. Manufacturing companies can’t escape these trends, which induce an increasing amount of complexity. Reasons for this phenomenon are internal and external sources of complexity so-called complexity drivers. Identifying, analyzing and understanding complexity drivers are the first step for complexity management’s development and implementation. Complexity management is a strategic issue for companies to be competitive. The purpose of this literature review is to provide a general overview regarding complexity drivers in manufacturing companies. The different definitions of complexity drivers are described, and a new overall definition of complexity drivers is presented. Furthermore, the existing approaches for complexity driver’s identification, operationalization and visualization are identified and specified. For complexity driver’s clustering, a superior classification system was developed based upon existing classification systems in the literature. The literature review was done by systematically analyzing and collecting existing literature and reveals gaps according to methodology and issue. Existing literature reviews are only focused on specific issues, such as logistics or supply chain management, and do not point out the applied research methodology in detail.

	abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) has huge promise for manufacturing parts with improved cost and performance compared to traditional subtractive manufacturing methods. But scale-up from prototyping operations and optimization of parts across this range of processes entails understanding complex and varied interactions between part design, materials, production processes, and part performance. To this end, significant investments are being made in R&D programs to manufacture high-performance AM parts, researching new designs and new materials. These programs generate huge amounts of data on materials, process parameters, tests, and part qualification. In parallel, many large companies are responding to competitive pressures by “digitizing” their supply chain, manufacturing processes, parts, and in-service data. Data is captured throughout the product lifecycle and analyzed for opportunities to drive down tooling costs and lead times and improve efficiencies and innovation. The phrase, “Digital Thread,” is commonly used to describe this process. AM represents an ideal opportunity to apply Digital Thread (DT) technology, since 3D printing relies on new digitally - driven technologies. Success requires that data be made available to integrated discovery, data mining, and physics-based simulation tools, enabling timely evaluation of manufactured parts and ensuring a fluid response to the in-process variability that can affect part quality. This can make the difference between parts that can be reliably reproduced to the level of required fidelity (and, hence, are certifiable), as well as reducing costs of physical testing, repair, and in-service liability. Collectively, we call this AM Informatics—the science of managing AM data across its lifecycle with full maintenance of the complex relationship between the part geometry, material, and individual processes used to create the final part. This report provides an overview of the current state of AM Informatics—how data from AM is being captured and utilized to enhance supply chain and production processes, shortening development times and enhancing the reproducibility and quality of part production in support of qualification objectives. © 2016, Mies et al.},

Firm characteristics and relationships, value chain positioning, and factors associated with product entry are examined for a set of 65 graphene-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises located in 16 different countries. As well as secondary sources and bibliometric methods to profile developments in graphene, we use computerized data mining and analytical techniques, including cluster and regression modeling, to identify patterns from publicly available online information on enterprise web sites. We identify groups of graphene small and medium-sized enterprises differentiated by how they are involved with graphene, the materials they target, whether they make equipment, and their orientation toward science and intellectual property. In general, access to finance and the firms’ location are significant factors that are associated with graphene product introductions. We also find that patents and scientific publications are not statistically significant predictors of product development in our sample of graphene enterprises. We further identify a cohort of graphene-oriented firms that are signaling plans to develop intermediate graphene products that should have higher value in the marketplace. Our findings suggest that policy needs to ensure attention to the introduction and scale-up of downstream intermediate and final graphene products and associated financial, intermediary, and market identification support.

Centrality analysis, path analysis, cluster analysis, etc. are used to identify the key papers of paradigm shifts, emerging fields, relatively important clusters and works respectively. A new metric, flow vergence index is devised for cluster analysis. The paradigm shift identified from this network is RFID technology, related with the supply chain management. With proper economic and policy supports, there are some good reasons to look forward for more wonders from the industry. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the integration of sustainability into supply chain management (SCM) is a key issue for ensuring corporate competitiveness in face of dynamic ecological and social environments. This paper reviews 185 journal publications of the last 20 years that formalize issues related to sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in quantitative models. In a content analysis, modeling and SCM characteristics as well as sustainability and SSCM constructs are elaborated. The models are assessed numerically by counting frequencies of occurrence and by clustering the paper sample according to selected characteristics. The findings indicate that SSCM models predominantly focus on deterministic approaches and the integration of environmental aspects of sustainability while neglecting stochastic modeling techniques and the consideration of social factors. By now, comprehensive modeling approaches are most often employed on intra-organizational levels whereas broader application areas are assessed by less complex models. The integration of pressures and incentives of external stakeholders or the formalization of sustainable supplier management and sustainability risks are identified as future research perspectives. Furthermore, the interrelationships between the triple bottom line dimensions are to be scrutinized in greater detail in order to avoid focused optimization of selected sustainability criteria. Seven modeling guidelines are derived from the reviewed literature to facilitate future model-based SSCM research. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.},

If during the running process instance the monitoring results show that the KPIs do not reach their target values, then the influential factors should be identified, and the appropriate adaptation strategies should be performed to prevent KPIs violations. In this paper we propose an integrated monitoring, analysis, prediction and adaptation approach to prevent KPIs violations. We have considered more than one KPI for a specific process; and we have tried to reach their target values simultaneously by proactive runtime adaptation before the end of the running process. In order to identify the dependency between KPIs and lower-level influential factors, an analysis is done on the data collected from historical process executions. For this purpose, Data Mining techniques have been used. The result is used to predict the KPIs values of the running instance. If KPIs violations are detected, adaptation requirements and adaptation strategies are identified. Since it is possible to define several KPIs for one process, and each has their own importance, so in this paper we tried to satisfy several KPIs target values.},

The use of sensors at various points in the value chain leads to a high volume of process, plant and quality data which results in a high, untapped potential with regard to the planning and control of the production processes and their components. At the same time, the developments in the field of Industrie 4.0 and Big Data Analytics have resulted in methods that enable the extraction, processing and analysis of large databases. The project OpenServ4P therefore aims to decouple tools for the planning and control of production processes from the actual user. For this purpose, an internet-based platform is developed, that offers various planning and control methods “as a service”. In addition, the following three services will be developed as part of the project: Industrial real-time production planning and control, adaptive risk management, and predictive maintenance and quality. Furthermore, the industrial applicability is proven within a real production scenario. © 2016, Carl Hanser Verlag. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: There is growing awareness of the increasing scope, scale, and threat of product counterfeiting. Awareness is also growing for the drafting of countermeasures that specifically address deceptive and non-deceptive counterfeiting. This research developed a method and tool to help review, understand, and cluster product-counterfeiting incidents. The intent is to assist brand owners and government agencies select effective countermeasures. Methods: The research builds upon earlier work that developed a typology of product counterfeiters, counterfeiting and offender groups, which is used here to create an original tool to organize and cluster the incidents. While incident data is often confidential or classified, several methods were used to access open-source information in order to apply the tool. First, a set of examples was selected from the literature to demonstrate the tool in principle. Second, in order to examine a complete data set of counterfeiting incidents, the open-source cases of the U.S. National Intellectual Property Rights Center were gathered, reviewed, coded, and analyzed to demonstrate the application of the tool. Results: A Product-Counterfeiting Incident Cluster Tool was developed which is consistent with Routine Activity Theory and Situational Crime Prevention and is intended to identify efficient and effective countermeasures. Conclusions: It is important to establish the type of fraud and the fraudster when developing anti-counterfeit strategies. The insight gained from assessing the specific product-counterfeiting incidents will assist in the profiling and selection of effective industry and government countermeasures. The scientific basis for understanding product counterfeiting is broadened by applying the outlined concepts and describing incidences through the clustering tool. © 2014 Spink et al.},

	abstract = {From the beginning of 21th, enterprise's competition predominance depends on capability of green supply chain. Suppliers are fountains of green supply chain, and the performance will directly influence the whole supply chain performance. The green supplier performance management is a key and difficult question in green supply chain manage system, which contains two cores, supplier performance evaluation and performance improvement. With the practice of two items, enterprise can control supplier performance continuously, and take improve actions in time, make the supplier performance to achieve requested level. Finally, enterprise can optimize the competition capability. In this paper, we investigate the multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems for supplier performance evaluation with triangular fuzzy information. Motivated by the idea of Bonferroni mean and Einstein operations, we develop the aggregation techniques called the triangular fuzzy Einstein Bonferroni mean (TFEBM) operator for aggregating the triangular fuzzy information. For the situations where the input arguments have different importance, we then define the triangular fuzzy weighted Einstein Bonferroni mean (TFWEBM) operator, based on which we develop the procedure for multiple attribute decision making under the triangular fuzzy environments. Finally, a practical example for supplier performance evaluation is given to verify the developed approach.},

A list of noted journals and search results from Science Direct and Web of Knowledge, IEEE Xplore, and INFORMS (approximately 11,000 journal articles) is used to prepare content collection. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is applied as the review and knowledge extraction methodology. Using the text analysis and mining method we can combine statistical methods and expert human judgment to extract knowledge in the form of key latent factors. The LSA based analysis gives the study a scientific grounding which helps to overcome the subjectivity of collective opinion about the trends. This approach allows proposing taxonomy of the research on power influences in supply chain. The adopted systems approach is used to find research gaps in each class of taxonomy. An emerging trend is noticed in the research of behavioral operations in supply chain. Understanding such a scholarly structure and future trends will assist researchers to assimilate the divergent developments of this multidisciplinary research in one place. This review will be beneficial for practitioners as they consider behavioral aspects in decision making. We have also studied articles related to supply chain published in Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA) journal. We have speculated what an ESWA-related community would like to see in future publications. This will encourage researchers to explore the recommended areas and publish to these outlets. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {FoodChain-Lab is modular open-source software for trace-back and trace-forward analysis in food-borne disease outbreak investigations. Development of FoodChain-Lab has been driven by a need for appropriate software in several food-related outbreaks in Germany since 2011. The software allows integrated data management, data linkage, enrichment and visualization as well as interactive supply chain analyses. Identification of possible outbreak sources or vehicles is facilitated by calculation of tracing scores for food-handling stations (companies or persons) and food products under investigation. The software also supports consideration of station-specific cross-contamination, analysis of geographical relationships, and topological clustering of the tracing network structure. FoodChain-Lab has been applied successfully in previous outbreak investigations, for example during the 2011 EHEC outbreak and the 2013/14 European hepatitis A outbreak. The software is most useful in complex, multi-area outbreak investigations where epidemiological evidence may be insufficient to discriminate between multiple implicated food products. The automated analysis and visualization components would be of greater value if trading information on food ingredients and compound products was more easily available. © 2016 Weiser et al.

An understanding of the impact of the simultaneous effects of customer demand patterns and order clustering, considering physical restrictions in product storage, is critical for improving operational performance. Storage restrictions may include storing non-uniform density stock keeping units (SKUs) whose dimensions and weight constrain the order-picking operation given that a priority must be followed. In this paper, a heuristic optimisation based on a quadratic integer programming is employed to generate a layout solution that considers customer demand patterns and order clustering. A simulation model is used to investigate the effects of creating and implementing these layout solutions in conjunction with density zones to account for restrictions in non-uniform density SKUs. Results from combining layout optimisation heuristics and density zoning indicate statistical significant differences between assignments that ignore the aforementioned factors and those that recognise it. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

The paper firstly presents three concepts including node strength centrality, betweenness centrality, and network centrality. They are used to calculate the weight of node enterprises in the agile supply chain network. And then, a series of agility indicators are designed to evaluate agility of agile supply chain network. AHP is used to calculate the weight of the indicators. Next, these indicators are used to get initial agility evaluation matrix by means of Delphi method, Data Mining, and so forth. Then FCE is used to calculate the membership degree on agility of node enterprises by combining the evaluation matrix with the weight of indicators. Last, the evaluation result of comprehensive agility of agile supply chain network is calculated on the basis of considering the weight of node enterprises. This method can reflect the effect which the network structure of supply chain network makes on the agility of the supply chain network.

Design/methodology/approach – Because of limited knowledge about the benefits of logistics clustering a main objective of this paper is theory building. The authors employed a grounded theory approach and conducted 135 open and semi structured interviews with logistics executives, government officials, academics, and chambers of commerce representatives. Findings – Study results revealed that, the agglomeration of logistics firms provides several key benefits to companies. Specifically, it was found that logistics clustering facilitates collaboration-related benefits, offering of value added services, career mobility for the logistics workforce within the cluster, and promotes job growth at multiple levels within the cluster. The authors offer a rich description of these benefits and the mechanisms that facilitate these outcomes. Research limitations/implications – This paper uses a qualitative approach. Further research using a quantitative approach to measure the magnitude of the impacts and benefits of logistics clusters would be desirable. Originality/value – This paper identifies the benefits associated with logistics clustering and thus provides justification for public authorities and private agents to invest in this phenomenon. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Voltage droop is a major reliability concern in nano-scale very large-scale integration designs. Undesirable voltage droop is often a result of excessive IR drop. On the other hand, Ldi/dt-induced droop occurs when logic gates in the circuit draw high-switching current from the on-chip power supply network, and this problem is exacerbated at high-clock frequencies and smaller technology nodes. A consequence of voltage droop is usually an increase in path delays and the occurrence of intermittent faults during circuit operation. The addition of conservative timing margins, also known as guardbands, is a common practice to tackle the problem of voltage droop. However, such static and pessimistic guardbands, which are calculated at design time based on worst-case conditions, lead to significant performance loss. Dynamic frequency scaling is an alternative approach that enables the dynamic adjustment of clock frequency based on the actual voltage droop seen during runtime. For dynamic voltage-frequency to be effective, accurate and real-time prediction of voltage droop is essential. We propose a support-vector machine (SVM)-based regression method to predict voltage droop due to pattern-dependent IR drop based on inputs to the chip at runtime. Moreover, we reduce the amount of data needed for accurate prediction by using correlation-based feature selection. Several benchmarks from ITC'99 and International Work on Logic and Synthesis'05 highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of delay-prediction accuracy. Since real-time droop prediction requires hardware implementation of the predictor, we present the hardware design and synthesis results to demonstrate that the hardware overhead for the SVM predictor is negligible for large circuits. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

Therefore, primarily, performance criteria and green supplier evaluation criteria were determined via a survey, then factor analysis was conducted to evaluate validity of factors. Then two step clustering was performed by using c-means clustering method. In the first step of clustering, all suppliers of a firm performing in automobile industry were clustered according to criteria-delivery, quality, cost and service. Thus best performing suppliers were determined. In the second step of clustering, best performing suppliers determined in the first step of clustering were evaluated with environmental/green criteria. As a result of clustering, best performing suppliers were splitted to three groups according to green criteria-good, medium, poor. Lastly, suppliers within the poor group were sequenced by using VIKOR method in order to include green supplier development programs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The water supply network is a demonstration site of Vitens, a Dutch water company that has several district metering areas where flow, pressure, electrical conductance and temperature are measured and logged online. Three different machine learning approaches are tested for their feasibility to detect anomalies. In the first approach, day-dependent support vector regression (SVR) models are trained for predicting the measurement signals and compared to straightforward models using mean and median estimates, respectively. Using SVRs or the averaged data as real-Time pattern recognizers on all available signals, large leakages can be detected. The second approach utilizes adaptive orthogonal projections and reports an event when the number of hidden variables required to describe the streaming data to a user-defined degree (energy-level threshold) increases. As a third approach, (unsupervised) clustering techniques are applied to detect anomalies and underlying patterns from the raw data streams. Preliminary results indicate that the current dataset is too limited in the amount of events and patterns to harness the potential of these techniques. © IWA Publishing 2016.},

In this work, the simple exponential smoothing method is employed to build an integrated mixture of local experts model (IMLEM) for demand forecasting using as independent variable a lagged gross domestic product (GDP) indicator. The IMLEM is usually employed to deal with rapidly changing situations and it is used in this work to improve the performance of the forecasts by providing a way to take into account short-term fluctuations on demand, due to changes on economic activity growth, within an easy to use forecasting method. The proposed method was applied on one-step ahead demand forecasting for a Brazilian beverage manufacturer for 130 non-seasonal stock keeping units (SKUs) and the accuracy of the generated forecasts allowed to reduce the forecasting errors. The obtained results also supported the decision making process by aiding demand planners concerning how to react to short-term fluctuations on demand. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the role and main attributes of manufacturing companies which operate in virtual supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - In order to identify the role and main attributes of manufacturing companies enabling to operate in a virtual supply chain, a three-step statistical analysis was employed, namely exploratory factor analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and non-hierarchical clustering technique. Findings - The findings show that virtual supply chain operations would not be supported by manufacturing companies offering highly customized products achieved by a unit production, developed in details and engineered to order. On the contrary, the large manufacturing companies of virtual supply chains report a high level of flexibility stemming from a wide scope of more standardized products offered to the market. The conducted study show that better ability of manufacturers supporting virtual supply chains is not industry specific. Research limitations/implications - The list of investigated attributes is not complete, and other characteristics of manufacturers in virtual supply chains should be identified. Another important shortcoming of the study is its quantitative character and generalization of the findings. Each "virtual" environment in supply chains may be unique and some of the compared characteristics may differ significantly. Therefore, the aforementioned attributes should be considered separately with a conscious focus on the environmental context. The quantitative study may be greatly enhanced by applying the case study approach, showing detailed solutions and practices, and thus making the study more valuable from the theoretical and managerial standpoints. Practical implications - The conducted study showed that better ability of manufacturers to support virtual supply chains is not industry specific, since the branch of electronic products and electrical equipment and components was represented by an equal share of manufacturers, both in non-virtual and virtual clusters. Furthermore, in order to operate in virtual supply chains, managers should pay attention to the structure and range of products delivered to the market. The managers should also be aware that apart from considering cost and efficiency, operating in a virtual supply chain environment also requires quality of products and processes in order to manufacture and deliver a superior value for the customers. Originality/value - Having recognized major groups of indicators demonstrating the level of ability of manufacturing companies to operate in a virtual supply chain, the attributes of three clusters of manufacturers possessing different bunch of features, significant for virtual supply chains, have been distinguished. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Making optimal inventory replenishment decision became critical for successful supply chain management. Existing traditional inventory management approaches and technologies showed as inadequate for these tasks. Current business environment requires new methods that incorporate more intelligent technologies and tools capable to make fast, accurate and reliable predictions. This paper deals with data mining applications for the supply chain inventory management. It describes the unified business intelligence semantic model, coupled with a data warehouse to employ data mining technology to provide accurate and up-to-date information for better inventory management decisions and to deliver this information to relevant decision makers in a user-friendly manner.

	abstract = {RFID technology allows the collecting of fine-grained real-time information on physical processes in the supply chain that often cannot be monitored using conventional approaches. However, because of the phenomenon of false-positive reads, RFID data streams resemble noisy analog measurements rather than the desired recordings of activities within a business process. The present study investigates the use of data mining techniques for filtering and aggregating raw RFID data. We consider classifiers based on logistic regression, decision trees, and artificial neural networks using attributes derived from low-level reader data. In addition, we present a custom-made algorithm for generating decision rules using artificial attributes and an iterative training procedure. We evaluate the classifiers using a massive set of data on pallet movements collected under real-world conditions at one of the largest retailers worldwide. The results clearly indicate high classification performance of the classification models, with the rule-based classifier outperforming all others. Moreover, we show that utilizing the full spectrum of data generated by the reader hardware leads to superior performance compared with the approaches based on timestamp and antenna information proposed in prior research. © 2014 ACM.},

Monetary input-output tables (MIOT) and network analysis can be applied to intersectoral supply chains and used to analyze structural aspects. We first provide a concise review of the literature related to network analysis applied to MIOTs. On the basis of a physical input-output table (PIOT) table of aluminum in the United States economy in 2007, we identify key sectors and discuss the overall topology of the aluminum network using tools of network analysis. Sectors highly dependent on metal product inputs or sales are identified using weighted degree centrality and their hierarchical organization is explored via clustering. Betweenness centrality and random walk centrality (page rank) are explored as means to identify network bottlenecks and relative sector importance. Aluminum, even though dominated by uses in the automobile, beverage and containers, and construction industries, finds application in a wide range of sectors. Motor vehicle parts manufacturing relies on a large number of upstream and downstream suppliers to function. We conclude by analyzing structural aspects of a subnetwork for automobile manufacturing and discuss how the use of network analysis relates to current criticality analyses of metal and mineral resources. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The integration of distribution and routing constitutes the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP), an important aspect of Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) systems. IRP involves decisions on timing of deliveries, sizes of shipments and routing of vehicles. In the context of supply chain collaboration, the scope of IRP expands to include replenishments at the depot. This paper studies an IRP involving multiple products from different suppliers, a central depot (CD) and a set of warehouses. We develop an integrated Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to determine the optimal replenishments from suppliers to the CD as well as the routing schedules of vehicles from CD to the multiple warehouses over the defined time horizon. We propose an extended three-phase heuristic called CARE (Clustering, Allocation, Routing -Extended). In the heuristic, the replenishment schedules, from suppliers to the CD (for multiple products in the defined time horizon), is solved using a dynamic programming (DP) model. The routing schedules of vehicles from CD to the multiple warehouses is then modeled and solved as a capacitated IRP (CIRP) problem. With the replenishment schedules as an input from the DP model, the CIRP is solved in three-phases: Cluster the nodes, Allocate to these nodes and Route delivery vehicles through clusters of nodes. Three variants of heuristics are proposed based on the changes to the routing phase - CARE1, CARE2, and CARE3. Computational results for a broad range of test instances yield promising results and show usefulness of the solution approaches. Particularly, the proposed heuristics outperformed CPLEX upper bounds for larger problems with lesser computational effort. The average improvement obtained by the heuristics over CPLEX upper bounds for 15 and 20 warehouse problems, respectively, are: CARE1 - 0.94% and 3.6%, CARE2 - 1.36% and 4.26%, CARE3 - 2.87% and 6.08%. We also show that the results from the proposed heuristic are statistically better than the CPLEX upper bounds. The proposed approaches can easily be implemented into existing VMI systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The method proposed builds on a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation introduced in a previous work by the authors. We illustrate the capabilities of our approach by its application to two case studies: the design of supply chains for hydrogen production and the multi-objective optimization of metabolic networks.

	abstract = {Tristyrylphenol ethoxylates are a group of technical nonionic surfactants that contain no single defined molecule but have a polymeric distribution with an average of 3 styrene and 16 ethylene oxide units. To analyze differences in the ethylene oxide distribution of the surfactant from various suppliers, and thus to specify more precisely the required quality for its use in agrochemical formulations, an analytical method was developed using liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry with exact mass measurement in combination with multivariate data analysis. The method investigated here enables a fast and comprehensive characterization and comparison of the tristyrylphenol ethoxylates from different sources. The batches showed significant differences among suppliers with regard to composition and content of by-products. Differences include the content of the different styrenated phenol ethoxylates (e.g.; mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrastyrylphenol ethoxylates) and of mono- and distyrylphenol copolymerized propoxylates-ethoxylates. The supplier of a given sample could be traced based on these differences by using a combination of principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. This was possible using either the raw material or a model agrochemical formulation containing the surfactant. © 2014 AOCS.},

	abstract = {In the age of globalization, the upgrading of China's manufacturing industries has attracted great attention from both academicians and practitioners, as it certainly has great implications for the development of China and, even further, for the development of the whole world. To address this issue, the study clarifies the effects of the internal technological innovation capability (ITIC) and external linkages (ELs) on upgrading the Chinese automotive manufacturing industry (CAMI) in the global value chain, in order to indicate the appropriate way for the CAMI to be further upgraded and provide references for the formulation of regional automotive industrial policies. Based on Chinese panel data, the results confirm that both ITIC and EL are important for the upgrading of the CAMI, with ITIC being the more important. Improvement of ITIC facilitates the industry's cooperation with the EL, resulting in better knowledge access. Furthermore, the results of cluster analysis reveal that regions with relatively developed automotive industries place emphasis on both the ITIC and EL. However, in some regions (e.g., Shanghai and Chongqing), the utility of EL seems insufficient. Therefore, the results of this paper, on the one hand, suggest policies should be directed towards increasing the ITIC of CAMI. On the other hand, in some regions, managers and policymakers need to explore further the advantage of clustering. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Complex polymetallic mining projects with multiple processing streams tend to require tight blending constraints, with different operational and processing targets. These blending requirements are generally not focused solely on metal grade, but rather on a set of geometallurgical variables that affect the performance of the operation and its ability to meet targets and maximize project value. Because of this, a multivariate destination policy is developed here, based on coalition formation clustering (a line of study of cooperative game theory), which avoids the use of cut-off grades and defines where material is sent by accounting for the value and relation of groups of blocks being processed together. This allows improving investment decisions as a result of optimizing project performance, because the variables that affect blending and processing requirements are actively accounted for in the optimization process. A case study on a copper-gold mine with six destinations is presented, where the method proposed shows significant improvements in meeting processing requirements and increases the expected net present value by 5.6% when compared to a traditional method. This shows that complex processing requirements can be accounted for and respected without any loss of project value. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper models and analyzes international trade flows using open flow networks (OFNs) with the approaches of flow distances, which provide a novel perspective and effective tools for the study of international trade. We discuss the establishment of OFNs of international trade from two coupled viewpoints: the viewpoint of trading commodity flow and that of money flow. Based on the novel model with flow distance approaches, meaningful insights are gained. First, by introducing the concepts of trade trophic levels and niches, countries' roles and positions in the global supply chains (or value-added chains) can be evaluated quantitatively. We find that the distributions of trading "trophic levels" have the similar clustering pattern for different types of commodities, and summarize some regularities between money flow and commodity flow viewpoints. Second, we find that active and competitive countries trade a wide spectrum of products, while inactive and underdeveloped countries trade a limited variety of products. Besides, some abnormal countries import many types of goods, which the vast majority of countries do not need to import. Third, harmonic node centrality is proposed and we find the phenomenon of centrality stratification. All the results illustrate the usefulness of the model of OFNs with its network approaches for investigating international trade flows. © 2015 Shenet al.

	abstract = {The multiple criteria ABC analysis is widely used in inventory management, and it can help organizations to assign inventory items into different classes with respect to several evaluation criteria. Many approaches have been proposed in the literature for addressing such a problem. However, most of these approaches are fully compensatory in multiple criteria aggregation. This means that an item scoring badly on one or more key criteria could be placed in good classes because these bad performances could be compensated by other criteria. Thus, it is necessary to consider the non-compensation in the multiple criteria ABC analysis. To the best of our knowledge, the ABC classification problem with non-compensation among criteria has not been studied sufficiently. We thus propose a new classification approach based on the outranking model to cope with such a problem in this paper. However, the relational nature of the outranking model makes the search for the optimal classification solution a complex combinatorial optimization problem. It is very time-consuming to solve such a problem using mathematical programming techniques when the inventory size is large. Therefore, we combine the clustering analysis and the simulated annealing algorithm to search for the optimal classification. The clustering analysis groups similar inventory items together and builds up the hierarchy of clusters of items. The simulated annealing algorithm searches for the optimal classification on different levels of the hierarchy. The proposed approach is illustrated by a practical example from a Chinese manufacturer. Furthermore, we validate the performance of the approach through experimental investigation on a large set of artificially generated data at the end of the paper. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Supply chain network design is one of the most important strategic decisions that need to be optimized for long-term efficiency. Critical decisions include facility location, inventory, and transportation issues. This study proposes that with a dual-channel supply chain network design model, the traditional location-inventory problem should be extended to consider the vast amount of online customers at the strategic level, since the problem usually involves multiple and conflicting objectives. Therefore, a multi-objective dual-channel supply chain network model involving three conflicting objectives is initially proposed to allow a comprehensive trade-off evaluation. In addition to the typical costs associated with facility operation and transportation, we explicitly consider the pivotal online customer service rate between the distribution centers (DCs) and their assigned customers. This study proposes a heuristic solution scheme to resolve this multi-objective programming problem, by integrating genetic algorithms, a clustering analysis, a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), and a Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Several experiments are simulated to demonstrate the possibility and efficacy of the proposed approach. A scenario analysis is conducted to understand the model's performance. © 2017 EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI.},

	abstract = {Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is one of the major tropical fruits exported through long supply chains to export markets. Production of high quality fruits and monitoring postharvest changes during storage and transport are thus primary concerns for exporters to ensure the premium value of fresh mango fruit after distribution. This study aims to demonstrate the applicability of Random Forests (RF) for estimating the internal qualities of mango based on peel colour. Two cultivars, namely Nam Dokmai and Irwin, having different fruit properties and grown in intensively managed orchards in Thailand and Japan, respectively, were used in this study. Postharvest changes in peel colour and fruit quality were observed under three storage conditions with respect to temperature. RF models were applied to establish a relationship between peel colour and fruit quality, and then tested the applicability based on model accuracy and variable importance computed by the RF. Specifically, this work demonstrates how the variable importance can be used to interpret the model results. The high accuracy and the information retrieved by the RF models suggest the applicability and practicality as a non-destructive assessment method for the quality of fresh mango fruit. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In recent years, some studies have used the data mining technique to detect earnings management, with which the accuracy has therefore risen. As such, this study attempts to diagnose the detecting biotechnology industry earnings management by integrating suitable computing models, we first screened the earnings management variables with the principal component analysis (PCA) and Bayesian network (BN), followed by further constructing the integrated model with the back propagation neural network (BPN) and C5.0 (decision tree) to detect if a company's earnings were seriously manipulated. The empirical results show that combining the BN screening method with C5.0 decision tree has the best performance with an accuracy rate of 98.51%. From the rules set in the final additional testing of the study, it is also found that an enterprise's prior period discretionary accruals play an important role in affecting the serious degree of accrual earnings management. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach: CPHR is first compared to multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and logistic regression (LR) to assess its suitability and accuracy to SC applications using three years of financial quarterly data for 69 non-bankrupt and 74 bankrupt organizations. A k-means clustering approach is then applied to the survival curves of all 143 organizations to explore heuristics for predicting the timing of bankruptcy petitions. Findings: CPHR makes bankruptcy predictions at least as accurately as MDA and LR. The survival function also provides valuable information on when bankruptcy might occur. This information allows SC members to be prioritized into three groups: financially healthy companies of no immediate risk, companies with imminent risk of bankruptcy and companies with intermediate levels of risk that need monitoring. Originality/value: The current paper proposes a new analytical approach to scanning and assessing the financial risk of SC members (suppliers or customers). Traditional models are able to predict if but not when a financial failure will occur. Lacking this information, it is impossible for SC managers to prioritize risk mitigation activities. A simple decision rule is developed to guide SC managers in setting these priorities. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {We discuss in this paper the decision making in choosing the best alternative from some available options based on possibly a large number of selection criteria. This multi-criteria decision problem typically arises in supplier selection in supply chain management. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the applications of dimensional reduction methods such as factor analysis to such decision processes. There are, however, a number of inherent issues and difficulties which have not been adequately addressed in the literature. For instance, there may be some criteria which load significantly on more than one factor. More importantly, it is seen in this paper that it is not always sensible to determine the importance of an identified factor according to its amount of shared common variance or explained variation. Similarly, attempts to routinely determine the local relative weight (within a factor) of importance of a criterion based on its factor loading or correlation with the factor may also lead to results in sharp contrast to those obtained from the experience of the practitioner. The present paper gives a simple, practical and easily implemented procedure to alleviate these difficulties. Although factor analysis is employed, it merely serves as a means of facilitating the direct rating of importance of each criterion and therefore does not experience the same difficulties of the classical factor analysis approach. Two examples are given to illustrate the proposed method and illustrate some potential problems of current approaches in the literature. The discussion in this paper will assist the practitioner in applying appropriately factor analysis in the decision procedure. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The Canadian apparel industry has long been challenged by imports from low-wage countries while its exports have declined since their height in 2002. This situation was exacerbated with trade liberalisation, which started in January 2005. Data from Industry Canada and a number of studies, amongst which those of the Apparel Human Resources Council (AHRC), showing the adverse effects of trade liberalisation since the phasing out of the multi-fibre agreement in 2005, the lack of competitive advantage for Canada as an apparel manufacturing nation and the subsequent rapid decline of its apparel industry, pointed to the need for a strategic response from the Canadian apparel industry, particularly from small to medium-sized enterprises. A study conducted for the AHRC of the Federal Government of Canada outlined a number of strategies that Canadian apparel companies could pursue, focusing on elements other than manufacturing in the traditional apparel value chain. These strategies seemed to suggest the implementation of a cluster approach where greater cooperation between suppliers would be required throughout the supply chain with a focus on functional expertise and relationships. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether a cluster strategy is being applied or if indeed it is applicable to Canada’s apparel companies. Design/methodology/approach – A literature search, was undertaken to find the options available for the organisation of SMEs so that: an analytical framework could be created from the various theories and concepts that; would enable the evidence-based selection of an option or options suitable for adoption by Canadian apparel SMEs, to assist them to be more effective than stand-alone enterprises. Data were collected from case studies of Canadian apparel companies, an Experience Survey (conducted through face-to-face interviews with the directors of the AHRC, the Canadian Apparel Federation, Industry Canada, and Canadian retail and apparel supply executives) and from the responses to an online questionnaire sent to Canadian apparel suppliers. The data were subjected to examination using the analytical framework to determine whether the evidence existed on which to base a cluster-based strategic response to competition from overseas apparel suppliers, or whether one of the alternative options might be a more suitable match with the Canadian apparel business environment. Findings – Neither the case studies nor the Experience Survey revealed sufficient evidence of open communication or of cooperation among suppliers in areas that would fortify horizontal clustering amongst apparel SMEs, such as the sharing of labour, market research or supply chain management; similar findings emerged from the online questionnaire sent to Canadian apparel suppliers, which showed little evidence favouring cluster development as a strategic response for the Canadian apparel supply industry. The research also showed that industrialists, experts and government advisors all recognised that, beginning with trade liberalisation in 2005, there had been a transformation of the Canadian apparel industry from a manufacturing to a service industry with the retailers taking much stronger control of the supply chain than before, which, taken together with the lack of open communication or cooperation among apparel suppliers gives rise to conditions which favour collaboration over clustering. Originality/value – The paper provides a firm evidence base upon which to develop a different strategy for Canadian SMEs than the cluster approach that has been proposed to date. The findings reported in this paper show that Canadian apparel industry leaders, government and industry-led support organisations, retailers and suppliers all recognise that the type of open communication or of cooperation among suppliers in areas that would fortify horizontal clustering amongst apparel SMEs, such as the sharing of labour, market research or supply chain management does not occur to a sufficient extent to support the adoption of a cluster strategy by the Canadian apparel sector (although it may be applicable in Quebec). Canadian retailers have now taken the leading role in the supplier/ retailer relationship. Any future strategy will need to take account of this repositioning of retailers and be centred upon vertical relationships between individual apparel suppliers and retailers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

We define the architecture of SCA as the integration of three sets of resources, data management resources (DMR), IT-enabled planning resources and performance management resources (PMR), from the perspective of a resource-based view. Based on the data collected from 537 manufacturing plants, we test hypotheses exploring the relationships among these resources, supply chain planning satisfaction, and operational performance. Our analysis supports that DMR should be considered a key building block of manufacturers business analytics initiatives for supply chains. The value of data is transmitted to outcome values through increasing supply chain planning and performance capabilities. Additionally, the deployment of advanced IT-enabled planning resources occurs after acquisition of DMR. Manufacturers with sophisticated planning technologies are likely to take advantage of data-driven processes and quality control practices. DMR are found to be a stronger predictor of PMR than IT planning resources. All three sets of resources are related to supply chain planning satisfaction and operational performance. The paper concludes by reviewing research limitations and suggesting further SCA research issues. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

While some of these effects are positive, making more resilient supply chains, there are also the negative effects of scale and complexity, making these supply chains more challenging than ever to manage.

This measure must not only account for the number of arcs, but the amount of information and material carried on it, as well as incorporate the benefit that virtual arcs add to the network by increasing efficiency and reducing information, product and financial transfer costs and time.

	abstract = {Crop yield models can assist decision makers within any agro-industrial supply chain, even with regard to decisions that are unrelated to the crop production. Considering the characteristics of the mechanisms and data related to yield, data mining techniques are suitable candidates for modelling. The use of these techniques within a context with feature engineering, feature selection, and proper tuning can further improve performance beyond a simple replacement of multiple linear regression. To evaluate the impact of the different steps in the mentioned context, we evaluated sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) yield modelling with data obtained from a sugarcane mill. For a combination of six techniques, tuning, feature selection, and feature engineering, leading to 66 combinations, we assessed final model performance. Average performance across combinations resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.42 Mg ha−1. Using different techniques led to a range of MAE from 4.57 to 8.80 Mg ha−1 on average. The best and worst performances for an individual model were MAEs of 4.11 and 9.00 Mg ha−1. Models with lower performance were close to simply predicting yield from the average yield for each number of cuts (MAE of 9.86 Mg ha−1). Tuning and feature engineering reduced the MAE on average by 1.17 and 0.64 Mg ha−1, respectively. Feature selection removed nearly 40% of the features but increased the MAE by 0.19 Mg ha−1. The performance of models was improved by simple strategies such as decomposing weather attributes and detailing fertilisation. Evaluation of feature importance provided by the RReliefF feature selection algorithm was used to explain the performance gains. If empirical models are needed, they will rely on using advanced techniques, but they will need proper algorithm tuning and feature engineering to extract most of the information from datasets. Based on the results, we recommend following the presented workflow for the development of yield models. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Here "structure" means a functor on a category, in this case the category of "combinatorial systems" that model manufacturing systems and supply networks. The details of the dynamics of these systems are frequently the domain of specialists and are ill understood outside such areas. Clustering activities in subsystems introduces covers as scales of analysis. This allows the development of sheaves of schedules and their properties which are analyzed by an adaptation of Čech cohomology. These are applied in supply networks to characterize the fragmentation of these networks and to characterize the conditions for local changes in schedules to extend to the whole system.

Design/methodology/approach: In this paper we present Bibliometric and Network analysis to examine current state research on optimization in supply chain management to identify established and emergent research field for future investigation. The systematic research review which we used in our study have not grasp or assess by other researchers on this topic. Firstly, based on our methodology Bibliometric analysis began by identifying 1610 publications raised from scientific journals, included literatures from 1994 to March of 2016. Secondly, we applied PageRank algorithm in our data for citation analysis to indicate the significance of a publication. Thirdly, the topological decision variables analysis is done based on Louvain method for network data clustering, for this proposes we used the rigorous tools. Finding: Based on our Network analysis result, the optimization in supply chain management research can be divided into four clusters/modules that introduced fundamental skill, knowledge, theory, application and method. Research limitations/implications: We presented some limitation in our research in some fields which could allow new researchers and practitioners conduct the future research to grow up in different dimensions. Practical implications: Practitioners or policy maker usually are not familiar with these type researches so this is why mush of these survey remain in theatrical and conceptual. Future investigation needs to play in practical application domain instead stop merely in opinion. Originality/value: Based on our research, the researchers have more attention to work in conceptual analysis due to other fields but we believe that in facility location problem there many remarkable rooms still exist for future research to development.

	abstract = {In an increasingly interconnected world, physical, service, and digital supply networks are becoming progressively more complex, dynamic, and interdependent. Moreover, sustainability concerns push for higher efficiency in the use of resources, reducing protective redundancies and making supply networks more susceptible to disruptions. Supply network resilience is an emerging concept related to the inherent ability of a network to tolerate and overcome disruptions, a central capacity to achieve long term-sustainable operations. However, current understanding of the impact of network formation and re-configuration mechanisms on resilience is at its early stages. In this article, resilience by teaming (RBT) association decisions, inspired in the fault-tolerance by teaming principle from Collaborative Control Theory, are characterized and applied in network formation and re-configuration mechanisms. The impact of RBT on emerging supply network topology and resilience under targeted and random disruptions is measured and compared to scenarios were only traditional association rules are applied. Results show that the introduction of supply network agents using RBT association rules significantly (1) increases quality of service (QoS) with no significant cost increase in normal operation, (2) increases post-disruption QoS by 15-30% under random disruptions and 10% under targeted disruptions without cost increase vs. normal operation - when at least 20% of the agents use RBT association rules. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {We propose a Hybrid Scenario Cluster Decomposition (HSCD) heuristic for solving a large-scale multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming (MS-MIP) model corresponding to a supply chain tactical planning problem. The HSCD algorithm decomposes the original scenario tree into smaller sub-trees that share a certain number of predecessor nodes. Then, the MS-MIP model is decomposed into smaller scenario-cluster multi-stage stochastic sub-models coordinated by Lagrangian terms in their objective functions, in order to compensate the lack of non-anticipativity corresponding to common ancestor nodes of sub-trees. The sub-gradient algorithm is then implemented in order to guide the scenario-cluster sub-models into an implementable solution. Moreover, a Variable Fixing Heuristic is embedded into the sub-gradient algorithm in order to accelerate its convergence rate. Along with the possibility of parallelization, the HSCD algorithm provides the possibility of embedding various heuristics for solving scenario-cluster sub-models. The algorithm is specialized to lumber supply chain tactical planning under demand and supply uncertainty. An ad-hoc heuristic, based on Lagrangian Relaxation, is proposed to solve each scenario-cluster sub-model. Our experimental results on a set of realistic-scale test cases reveal the efficiency of HSCD in terms of solution quality and computation time. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {To improve the design of the electricity infrastructure and the efficient deployment of distributed and renewable energy sources, a new paradigm for the energy supply chain is emerging, leading to the development of smart grids. There is a need to add intelligence at all levels in the grid, acting over various time horizons. Predicting the behavior of the energy system is crucial to mitigate potential uncertainties. An accurate energy prediction at the customer level will reflect directly in efficiency improvements in the whole system. However, prediction of building energy consumption is complex due to many influencing factors, such as climate, performance of thermal systems, and occupancy patterns. Therefore, current state-of-the-art methods are not able to confine the uncertainty at the building level due to the many fluctuations in influencing variables. As an evolution of artificial neural network (ANN)-based prediction methods, deep learning techniques are expected to increase the prediction accuracy by allowing higher levels of abstraction. In this paper, we investigate two newly developed stochastic models for time series prediction of energy consumption, namely Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM) and Factored Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (FCRBM). The assessment is made on a benchmark dataset consisting of almost four years of one minute resolution electric power consumption data collected from an individual residential customer. The results show that for the energy prediction problem solved here, FCRBM outperforms ANN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and CRBM. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

In our most expansive modeling approach, an estimated final characteristic of a product is updated after each manufacturing operation. Our initial application is for the manufacture of microprocessors, and we predict final microprocessor speed. Using these predictions, early corrective manufacturing actions may be taken to increase the speed of expected slow wafers (a collection of microprocessors) or reduce the speed of fast wafers. Such predictions may also be used to initiate corrective supply chain management actions. Developing statistical learning models for this task has many complicating factors: (a) a temporally unstable population (b) missing data that is a result of sparsely sampled measurements and (c) relatively few available measurements prior to corrective action opportunities. In a real manufacturing pilot application, our automated models selected 125 fast wafers in real-time. As predicted, those wafers were significantly faster than average. During manufacture, downstream corrective processing restored 25 nominally unacceptable wafers to normal operation. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Because supply chains are complex systems prone to uncertainty, statistical analysis is a useful tool for capturing their dynamics. Using data on acquisition history and data from case study reports, we used regression analysis to predict backorder aging using National Item Identification Numbers (NIINs) as unique identifiers. More than 56,000 NIINs were identified and used in the analysis. Bayesian analysis was then used to further investigate the NIIN component variables. The results indicated that it is statistically feasible to predict whether an individual NIIN has the propensity to become a backordered item. This paper describes the structure of a Bayesian network from a real-world supply chain data set and then determines a posterior probability distribution for backorders using a stochastic simulation based on Markov blankets. Fuzzy clustering was used to produce a funnel diagram that demonstrates that the Acquisition Advice Code, Acquisition Method Suffix Code, Acquisition Method Code, and Controlled Inventory Item Code backorder performance metric of a trigger group dimension may change dramatically with variations in administrative lead time, production lead time, unit price, quantity ordered, and stock. Triggers must be updated regularly and smoothly to keep up with the changing state of the supply chain backorder trigger clusters of market sensitiveness, collaborative process integration, information drivers, and flexibility. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {In the present work, we study a multi-period facility location problem featuring many realistic constraints. In order to take into account vehicle routing from distribution centers to customers while maintaining a manageable size of the optimization problem, we develop a two-phase solution approach. In the first phase, the average distances and costs of transport from distribution centers to customers are evaluated using an exact clustering procedure based on a set-partitioning formulation. These costs serve as input to the facility location problem in the second phase, which is formulated as a mixed integer linear program and solved using a state-of-the art commercial solver. Many numerical experiments using real life data from the automotive industry are carried out in order to derive some insights related to multi-period modeling. We first show that in our case study, using static assignment decisions is better for the company as the corresponding operational benefit outweighs the additional cost to be incurred. We then compare the outputs of the multi-period model with those of its single-period counterpart. Finally, to cope with the computational difficulties encountered during the numerical experiments, we propose a linear relaxation based heuristic to solve larger instances of the problem. The heuristic method provides good quality solutions while significantly improving computation times. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Considering the vital importance on pursuing sustaining competitive advantage and long-term success for enterprises, sustainable operation has aroused extensive interests in academia and industry. Understanding the trend can fill the research gap between theory and practice. It is vital not only to implement relevant research to help firms obtain sustainability, but also to find what has been studied till now and what need further exploration in the near future. This paper applied automatic content analysis approach from scientometrics to identify the trend of researches on sustainable operation. The database came from Web of Science during 1988–2015. Specifically, a multi-stage clustering technique based on bibliographic coupling has also been introduced to examine which topics, which research trend, and which new ideas contribute to the scientific journal fields of sustainable operation. Our results identified that energy related journals were the classic magazines in sustainable operation field and energy technology was the top topic. USA, UK and Germany had contributed the most journal articles in this field. With the rapid expansion of Asia, Asian scientists, like South Korea and Singapore, also published many sustainable operation papers. It had been a novel trend that the sustainable operation research field was incorporating a broader range of cultural backgrounds and combined with supply chain management. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Background: Research and development at the edge of micro & nano electronics, nanotechnologies, photonics, materials and biotechnology and their integration into smart miniaturised systems open new opportunities for better quality of life. The area has received substantial public funding and support from the late 90s from the European Union Research Framework Programmes, including the currently running Horizon 2020. We undertook data collection, clustering and analysis of 119 projects (with about 500 M€ EU funding and 890 public and private organisations) covering the area of Micro-Nano-Bio-info technologies and Systems (MNBS) to document the allocation of public money spent on research, development and innovation in this field, to identify synergies, gaps and major trends as well as to verify the alignment with the relevant EU policies and define future challenges and next opportunities for support. Methodology: The projects, funded through several topics of the EC programmes, e.g. Bio-electronics, Biophotonics, Nanomedicine and Healthcare & Well-Being, have been clustered through a semi-automated process based on text mining, using RapidMiner software, with the text describing the projects and their tasks as the input. Text mining-based clustering is grounded in the words contained in the documents provided, and includes basically 2 steps: (i) document pre-processing and (ii) document clustering based on the word frequencies. The hierarchical clustering obtained provide us information related to the proximity of the projects with regard to the meaningful words related to the technologies, processes, applications, etc., which have been kept. This type of grouping provides certainty that projects are grouped with the closest projects in terms of overall content (e.g. objectives, tasks and technologies involved). Results: Classification: Eleven differentiated project categories have been defined, each containing from 6 to 17 projects. These categories can be further re-grouped in broader categories in several ways depending on the purpose, e.g. considering the link to either in-vivo (patient-centred devices) or in-vitro (portable devices and systems and analytical detection platforms) applications, to the level of portability (portable devices vs. platforms), or to the manufacturing importance. Participating (EU and non-EU) organisations include research and academic (37%), private companies (56%), end-users e.g. hospitals or clinical related institutions (4,7%) as well as public authorities and endusers associations in health, food and environment sectors (2,3%). Participation: The participants come from European countries and from Russia, Australia, Japan and the United States. The EU funding is spread all over Europe, though higher concentration is observed in the Western part of Europe. Driving forces: the large majority of projects is driven by two main requirements i.e. avoid the use of specialized laboratory-based (mainly hospital-centred), skilled labour-handled, expensive and time-consuming bio-samples and data analysis; and achieve lower cost, quasi-real-time monitoring or analysis using non-specialized infrastructures, at the Point of Care/Need (out-of-lab). Achievements and Challenges: overall the projects have delivered significant technological progress beyond the state-of-the-art and in some cases integrated prototypes have been validated at the laboratory and in fewer cases tested in real application environments. However, further R&D effort is needed in order to achieve better and compatible interfaces, higher system integration and technology readiness level, better connectivity, efficient manufacturing processes & technologies and validation in real application conditions. Additionally, a critical collaborative effort should be put on effective technology translation of research into new products, speeding up product development, market introduction and cost reduction. This should encompass product design, supply chain setup, user targeting, clinical validation, manufacturing and commercial roll-out. Conclusion: The projects′ portfolio analysis allowed sizing the EU funding and clustering of MNBS research and innovation activities, as well as identifying synergies, major trends, gaps and lessons to be learned for future public investment. Supporting further system integration and validation in real life environments as well as the creation of collaborative interdisciplinary platforms and innovation ecosystems will strongly contribute to new business and markets. It will accelerate the digitization of the European industry in key sectors like healthcare, food and security and support innovation through the full supply chains, thus will positively impact the EU's single market fit for the digital age. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.},

Therefore, a discussion about different risk attitudes affect quality control game of supply chain especially in logistics service supply chain (LSSC) is required. A basic quality control game model (Model I) was established in a LSSC composed of a logistics service integrator (LSI) and a functional logistics service provider (FLSP). In this model, LSI can choose to provide quality supervision or not, and FLSP can choose to accomplish a task according to the quality contract or cheat. The mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of Model I was presented. A new model (Model II) with different combinations of risk attitudes was then built based on Model I, and the new mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium was provided. The influences of various combinations of risk attitudes on LSI's supervision probability and FLSP's compliance probability were also discussed. Results show that the level of risk attitude of LSI and FLSP should not be unlimited, and an interval is existed respectively. LSI prefers risk-seeking FLSP in order to obtain smaller supervision possibility and larger compliance possibility. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The purpose of this article is to employ hierarchical cluster analysis for developing product architecture to support product variety. Design structure matrix is used to visualize and analyze product architecture in view of product modules, overlapping modules, and bus components. The proposed method for design structure matrix clustering consists of three phases. The first phase is component filtering to identify components that should be classified as bus components. The second phase is approximate structure formation that preliminarily organizes similar components to form a diagonal matrix. The third phase is partitioning analysis that finalizes the modules' boundary to yield the structured matrix as the solution of design structure matrix clustering. To examine the solution's quality, minimum description length from literature is used. Then, the proposed method is demonstrated via two literature examples and compared with the solutions by the manual and genetic algorithm approaches. One unique advantage of the proposed method is that the user can obtain and inspect the approximate structure in view of the diagonal matrix before finalizing the structured solution (e.g. estimate the number of modules). © SAGE Publications.},

For many economic sectors, enhancement of business network effects and positive externalities through transportation investments is vital to their competitive advantage. In essence, the directness of linkages between buyers and suppliers in any production network is important to ensuring that economies of localization accrue to the entire cluster in any region. Physical transport networks have a vital role to play in ensuring that directness in many sectors. In this paper, the contribution of transportation infrastructure to enhance business networks is analyzed by presenting directness measures explicitly linked to transport infrastructure. Two such measures are developed with general applicability to both developing and developed countries and the utility of the measures is motivated within the context of transportation investments. Such a directness measure has been broached in the literature but this is, to our knowledge, is the first attempt at developing a measure of this type. The transportation planning utility of such measures is also discussed. Next, we illustrate how the measure may be analyzed using a case example in the context of the automobile manufacturing cluster chain in Alabama, United States.},

This fraud increases the cost of the supply chain management and a fraud detection mechanism is necessary to reduce the risk of fraud in this business area. This study was carried out in order to develop a data warehouse design that supports forensic analytics by using the Benford's law in order to detect fraud. The approach relies on a generic and re-usable store procedure for data analytics. The data warehouse was tested with two datasets collected from an operational supply chain database from the inventory management and warranty claims processes. The results of the research showed that the supply chain data analyzed obeys to Benford's theory and that parameterized stored procedures with Dynamic SQL provide an excellent tool to analyze data in the supply chain for possible fraud detection. The implications of the results of the study are that the Benford's law can be used to detect fraud in the supply chain with the help of parameterized stored procedures and a data ware house, this can ease the workload of the fraud analyst in the supply chain function. Although the research only used data from the inventory management and warranty claim processes, the proposed store procedures can be extended to any process in the supply chain making the results generalizable to the supply chain management process. © 2014 Science Publication.},

	abstract = {Foreknowledge about sugarcane crop size can help industry members make more informed decisions. There exists many different combinations of climate variables, seasonal climate prediction indices, and crop model outputs that could prove useful in explaining sugarcane crop size. A data mining method like random forests can cope with generating a prediction model when the search space of predictor variables is large. Research that has investigated the accuracy of random forests to explain annual variation in sugarcane productivity and the suitability of predictor variables generated from crop models coupled with observed climate and seasonal climate prediction indices is limited. Simulated biomass from the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) sugarcane crop model, seasonal climate prediction indices and observed rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature, and radiation were supplied as inputs to a random forest classifier and a random forest regression model to explain annual variation in regional sugarcane yields at Tully, in northeastern Australia. Prediction models were generated on 1 September in the year before harvest, and then on 1 January and 1 March in the year of harvest, which typically runs from June to November. Our results indicated that in 86.36 % of years, it was possible to determine as early as September in the year before harvest if production would be above the median. This accuracy improved to 95.45 % by January in the year of harvest. The R-squared of the random forest regression model gradually improved from 66.76 to 79.21 % from September in the year before harvest through to March in the same year of harvest. All three sets of variables—(i) simulated biomass indices, (ii) observed climate, and (iii) seasonal climate prediction indices—were typically featured in the models at various stages. Better crop predictions allows farmers to improve their nitrogen management to meet the demands of the new crop, mill managers could better plan the mill’s labor requirements and maintenance scheduling activities, and marketers can more confidently manage the forward sale and storage of the crop. Hence, accurate yield forecasts can improve industry sustainability by delivering better environmental and economic outcomes. © 2016, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy soft sets realize a hybrid soft computing model in which the methods of gradualness and parametrization for dealing with uncertainty are combined effectively. Up to now, fuzzy soft sets have shown to be useful in various fields such as algebra, logic, data mining, supply chains risk management, forecasting, prediction and decision making under uncertainty. Also it is well-known that the level set approach and decomposition theorems play an important role in investigating fuzzy concepts or structures. Thus decomposition of fuzzy soft sets is a meaningful research topic from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. Nevertheless, so far as we know very few works contribute to this important issue. The present study endeavors to fill this blank in the theory of fuzzy soft sets. It offers a systematic investigation of scalar products of fuzzy soft sets. Particularly it is shown that scalar product operations can be regarded as semimodule actions and algebraic structures like ordered idempotent semimodules of fuzzy soft sets over ordered semirings can be constructed. Also the collection of all t-level soft sets of a fuzzy soft set can form a distributive lattice under soft union and intersection operations. Finally, some decomposition theorems for fuzzy soft sets are established using scalar products and level soft sets with either constant thresholds or variable thresholds given by fuzzy sets. ©2015 Old City Publishing, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose: Companies are increasingly specializing and developing those key areas with which they can compete on the global market and are linking in clusters that are ingredient of territorial competitiveness. Clusters can play a competitive role in global value chains but once being successful, they may decline. For this reason, researching key factors for the successful operation of clusters in Slovenia is beneficial. Methodology: This study is based on an extensive review of scientific literature. Theoretical findings are tested by a study of clustering in Slovenia. In practice, we determine the number of operating clusters fifteen years after they were initiated by the institutional environment with help of web pages, e-mails and telephone calls. Using interviews, we determine reasons for the cessation of operations on the part of former directors and factors of successful operations with directors of successful clusters. Results: The institutional environment initiated start-up processes of creating clusters in Slovenia. After the termination of institutional financial support, Slovenian clusters, which have failed to develop their own financing system, ceased operation. Directors of still operating clusters confirmed that trust between cluster members is the most important success factor in the operation of clusters. Conclusion: The institutional environment in Slovenia adopted cluster policy and successfully leveraged the establishment of clusters using start-up financing. Less than half of these clusters continue to prosper under their own stream after policy retreatment. Clusters were not prepared for a dramatically different way of working. Trust has become a major driving force of adjusting to new conditions. © 2016, De Gruyter Open Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {No Australian wool price hedonic studies have separated auction data into different end product-processing groups (PPR) on the basis of all fibre attributes that affect the suitability of wool sale lots for PPR. This study was conducted to assess: (1) whether including information about PPR groupings is more useful in understanding price than clustering by broad fibre diameter (FD) categories, and (2) if the 'noise' of macroeconomic effects on price can be reduced by using a clean price relative to the market indicator (RelPrice) formula or a log RelPrice formula compared with log price or clean price. Hedonic models using data derived from 369918 Australian auction sale lots in 2010-2011 were estimated for these four dependent price variables. Linear FD models predicted less of price's variance than quadratic or exponential models. Segmenting wool sale lots into 10 PPR before wool price analyses was found to increase the proportion of price variance explained and thus be worthwhile. The change in price with a change in FD, staple length and staple strength differs significantly between PPR. Calculating RelPrice or log RelPrice appears a better price parameter than clean price or log price. Comparing the RelPrice and clean price models, the mean absolute percentage errors were 6.3% and 16.2%, respectively. The differences in price sensitivity to FD, staple length and staple strength across PPR implies a complex set of price-setting mechanisms for wool as different users place different values on these wool properties. These price-setting mechanisms need to be incorporated in hedonic models for agricultural products that possess this characteristic. The wool price premiums can be used to estimate relative economic values when constructing sheep breeding selection indexes and can help determine the most profitable wool clip preparation strategies. © CSIRO 2016.},

	abstract = {We rarely associate social networks with the movement of freight vehicles. Yet, taking a network perspective on supply chains has seen a strong interest in recent literature. It allows for a variety of system-level analysis that is not possible when taking a single focal firm view as is often the case in more classical supply chain approaches. Creating the network of connectivity on which the analyses are based can be quite a daunting and computationally challenging task. In this paper we create a large-scale network from the movement of commercial vehicles in a metropolitan area in South Africa, using the direct trip between consecutive facilities as a proxy for a tie, or dyad, in the network. We analyse how density-based clustering parameters influence the completeness of the network—that is the number of nodes included—as well as the computational burden of extracting the network. The results of the multi-objective analysis confirm the sensitivity of the resulting network, and suggest much smaller search radii and fewer points per cluster. We also report on a number of node- and network-level properties of the complex network using the proposed clustering configuration on the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropole network in South Africa. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

This paper focuses on implementing mass customisation through development of semi-finished forms of products (vanilla boxes) to reduce supply chain cost and facilitate the production process. The challenge is that the possible number of vanilla box configurations grows dramatically with the increase in number of product variants. In the solution approach, the basic information of product variety is captured in a matrix format, specifying the component requirements for each product variant. Then, hierarchical clustering is applied over the components with the considerations of demands. The clustering method consists of three major stages: similarity analysis, tree construction and tree-based analysis. The key stage is similarity analysis, in which problem-specific information can be incorporated in the clustering process. Two numerical examples from the literature are used to verify that the clustering approach can yield good-quality solutions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Green supplier development focuses on helping organizations integrate activities to improve the natural environmental performance of their supply chains. These green-supplier-development programs require substantial resources and investments by a buyer company. Investigation into investment management in this context has only begun. This paper introduces a methodology to help manage investment in green-supplier-development and business-supplier-development practices. Managing these practices and their outcomes requires managing of a large sets of data. We propose a combination of rough set theoretic and fuzzy clustering means (FCM) approaches; first to simplify, and then sharpen the focus on the complex environment of evaluation of the investment decisions. The combined methodology, based on performance measures of supplier practices and agreed-upon investment objectives, identifies a set of guidelines that can help make decisions about sound investments in the supplier practices more effectively and judiciously. Various steps involved in the methodology are illustrated through using an example developed to highlight the salient steps and issues of the methodology. We show how the results may be interpreted to obtain many insights useful from both practical and research perspectives. Although the impetus to developing this methodology came from sustainability considerations, the methodology is general enough to be applicable in other areas where management and evaluation of investments is based on large data sets. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) within the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

	abstract = {The TV experience is being transformed with online social networks. TV audiences are sharing their opinions (i.e., social response) about video programs on OSNs (e.g., Twitter and Sina Weibo), thus providing a great opportunity for mining these data for stakeholders in TV value chains. This new paradigm is touted as social TV analytics, integrating the emerging big data research into TV. In this article, we envision and develop a unified big data platform for social TV analytics, extracting valuable insights from TV social response in a real-time manner. Such a platform presents tremendous challenges in networking architecture for our big data platform. We propose to build a cloud-centric platform with SDN support, providing on-demand virtual machines and reconfigurable networks. The architecture of our system consists of three key components, including a robust data crawler system, an SDN-enabled big data processing system, and a social media analytics system. The data crawler system adopts a distributed architecture to circumvent the access constraints of OSNs to crawl sufficient data about each TV program of interest; the SDN-enabled big data processing system integrates SDN and Hadoop, and exploits the SDN benefit to transfer intermediate data between different processing units to accelerate the data processing rate; and the social media analytics system extracts the public perception and knowledge related to TV programs based on microblog data. We have built a proof-of-concept demo over a private cloud at Nanyang Technological University. Feature verification and performance comparisons demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the system. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

Based on the underlying philosophy of group technology, a growing hierarchical self-organising map algorithm (GHSOM) is proposed to identify a lower two-dimension visual clustering map that can effectively address supply chain clustering problems. The proposed approach provides optimal solutions by decomposing a large-sized supply chain problem into independent, small, manageable problems. It facilitates simple decision-making by exploring similar clusters that are represented by the neighbouring branches in the GHSOM map structure. Unlike other approaches in literature, the proposed approach can further attain good topological ordered representations of the various work order families, to be processed by clusters of supply units along with information on hierarchical sub-cell formation as identifiable from the visually navigable map. The proposed approach has been successfully applied on 16 benchmarked problems. The performance of GHSOM based on grouping efficacy measure outperformed the best results in literature. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Mutually intertwined supply chains in contemporary economy result in a complex network of trade relationships with a highly non-trivial topology that varies with time. In order to understand the complex interrelationships among different countries and economic sectors, as well as their dynamics, a holistic view on the underlying structural properties of this network is necessary. This study employs multi-regional input-output data to decompose 186 national economies into 26 industry sectors and utilizes the approach of interdependent networks to analyze the substructure of the resulting international trade network for the years 19902011. The partition of the network into national economies is observed to be compatible with the notion of communities in the sense of complex network theory. By studying internal versus cross-subgraph contributions to established complex network metrics, new insights into the architecture of global trade are obtained, which allow to identify key elements of global economy. Specifically, financial services and business activities dominate domestic trade whereas electrical and machinery industries dominate foreign trade. In order to further specify each national sectors role individually, (cross-)clustering coefficients and cross-betweenness are obtained for different pairs of subgraphs. The corresponding analysis reveals that specific industrial sectors tend to favor distinct directionality patterns and that the cross-clustering coefficient for geographically close country pairs is remarkably high, indicating that spatial factors are still of paramount importance for the organization of trade patterns in modern economy. Regarding the evolution of the trade networks substructure, globalization is well-expressed by trends of several structural characteristics (e.g., link density and node strength) in the interacting network framework. Extreme events, such as the financial crisis 2008/2009, are manifested as anomalies superimposed to these trends. The marked reorganization of trade patterns, associated with this economic crisis in comparison to "normal" annual fluctuations in the network structure is traced and quantified by a new widely applicable generalization of the Hamming distance to weighted networks. © 2015 Maluck, Donner.},

	abstract = {One of the most important problem in supply chain management is the design of distribution systems which can reduce the transportation costs and meet the customer's demand at the minimum time. In recent years, cross-docking (CD) centers have been considered as the place that reduces the transportation and inventory costs. Meanwhile, neglecting the optimum location of the centers and the optimum routing and scheduling of the vehicles mislead the optimization process to local optima. Accordingly, in this research, the integrated vehicle routing and scheduling problem in cross-docking systems is modeled. In this new model, the direct shipment from the manufacturers to the customers is also included. Besides, the vehicles are assigned to the cross-dock doors with lower cost. Next, to solve the model, a novel machine-learning-based heuristic method (MLBM) is developed, in which the customers, manufacturers and locations of the cross-docking centers are grouped through a bi-clustering approach. In fact, the MLBM is a filter based learning method that has three stages including customer clustering through a modified bi-clustering method, sub-problems' modeling and solving the whole model. In addition, for solving the scheduling problem of vehicles in cross-docking system, this paper proposes exact solution as well as genetic algorithm (GA). GA is also adapted for large-scale problems in which exact methods are not efficient. Furthermore, the parameters of the proposed GA are tuned via the Taguchi method. Finally, for validating the proposed model, several benchmark problems from literature are selected and modified according to new introduced assumptions in the base models. Different statistical analysis methods are implemented to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, the traditional quality management of hydrological data has focused mainly on intrinsic quality problems, such as outlier detection, nullity interpolation, consistency, completeness, etc., and could not be used to assess the quality of application - that is, consumed data in the form of data supply chain and with a granularity of tasks. To achieve these objectives, we first present a methodology to derive quality dimensions from hydrological information system by questionnaire and show the cognitive differences in quality dimension importance, then analyze the correlations between the tasks, classify them into five categories and construct the quality assessment model with time limits in the data supply chain. Exploratory experiments suggest the assessment system can provide data quality (DQ) indicators to DQ assessors, and enable authorized consumers to monitor and even control the quality of data used in an application with a granularity of tasks. © IWA Publishing 2015.},

Semi-structured interviews and a ranking approach facilitated the treatment of qualitative data through quantitative coding using cloud-based applications. The research identified 12 barriers to RL implementation, four of them very significant according to the responses of the interviewees: the regulatory environment, additional costs involved, lack of recognition in the construction supply chain, and extra effort required. The study also explored their inter-relationships through the Co-occurrence Index.

The solution approach is based on hierarchical clustering, in which the tree structure is applied to construct the supply chain network. One core technique is to investigate the coupling values between the modules by characterizing the grouping condition in the structuring process.

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate and analyse the perceptions of South Australian construction practitioners on drivers affecting the implementation of reverse logistics (RL). In this context, RL is defined as the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value or ensuring proper disposal. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight practitioners to collect data and the interview transcripts were analysed using the NVivo (version 10) package. Cluster analysis was used to cross-validate the findings and provide an in-depth insight into the findings. Findings - The findings indicate that most of the drivers identified in earlier research are relevant for the construction industry. In addition, the study identified some new drivers that are categorised as "targeted demands by an exclusive clientele". These drivers were found to be complementary to the economic, environmental and social drivers as previously conceptualised. In addition, a set of factors affecting the strength of drivers that had been overlooked in previous studies emanated from the interview analysis. These include the type of project and the attributes of clients, both of which strongly affect the drivers of RL implementation in construction. Research limitations/implications - The major limitations are the relatively small size of the sample of interviewees and having interviewees from one geographic area with specific socio-economic characteristics. Practical implications - The identified drivers and the clustering of RL themes could be used by practitioners as a "road map" for the development of appropriate solutions to successfully promote RL within the construction industry. Organisational energies could thus be channelled towards the drivers that need the most improvement. Originality/value - The study contributes to this research sphere by employing cluster analysis to customise and contextualise the drivers that were previously identified. The study goes beyond the extant literature by discovering the prominent effects of these drivers on the impact of targeted demands by an exclusive clientele. This could be of great value in terms of creating avenues for future investigations on the topic. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Linked Open Data (LOD) has gained widespread adoption by large industries as well as non-profit organizations and governmental organizations. One of the early adopters of LOD technologies are libraries. Since the “early years”, libraries have been key use case and innovation driver for LOD and significantly contributed to the adoption of semantic technologies. The first part of this paper presents selected success stories of current activities in the Linked Data Library community. In a nutshell, these studies include (1) a conceptualization of the Linked Data Value chain, (2) a case study for consumption of Linked Data in a digital journal environment, and (3) an approach to publish metadata on the Semantic Web from an Open Access repository. These stories reveal a strong relationship between LOD in libraries and research topics addressed in traditional fields of computer science such as artificial intelligence, databases, and knowledge discovery. Thus, in the second part of this paper we systematically review the relation of LOD in digital libraries from a computer science perspective. We discuss current LOD research topics such as data integration and schema integration, distributed data management, and others. These challenges have been discussed with computer scientists at a German national database meetup as well as with librarians from ZBW—Leibniz Information Center for Economics and at international librarians meetup. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In the second stage, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) model is constructed to determine the weight of various quantitative and qualitative criteria. To address multiple decision criteria in supplier ranking, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is employed to select the final suppliers.

	abstract = {Overheating appears as a recurrent problem in apartments of the real estate market of Santiago de Chile, since their architectural design frequently does not incorporate passive cooling techniques. This situation is encouraged by a Thermal Regulation that allows extensive glazing surfaces in the apartments and that does not propose any criteria for limiting the risk of overheating. Nine apartment typologies were defined using the k-means clustering method from a database that contains 21,902 units. Sensitivity analysis was carried out by means of both global and local approaches, in order to identify the most sensitive parameters with respect to the summer comfort and the net effect of each single parameter, respectively. The results obtained suggest that the best performance in terms of summer comfort can be obtained from the combination of diverse parameters that would be significant in respect to the reduction of overheating, such as solar protection and night ventilation. In this sense, the approach proposed for this study not only allows introducing improvements in terms of summer thermal conditions according to the specific requirements of the apartment typologies, but also suggests the integration of attributes with the aim of being developed at the level of their value chain. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper introduces a predictive supply chain performance management model which combines process modelling, performance measurement, data mining models, and web portal technologies into a unique model. It presents the supply chain modelling approach based on the specialized metamodel which allows modelling of any supply chain configuration and at different level of details. The paper also presents the supply chain semantic business intelligence (BI) model which encapsulates data sources and business rules and includes the data warehouse model with specific supply chain dimensions, measures, and KPIs (key performance indicators). Next, the paper describes two generic approaches for designing the KPI predictive data mining models based on the BI semantic model. KPI predictive models were trained and tested with a real-world data set. Finally, a specialized analytical web portal which offers collaborative performance monitoring and decision making is presented. The results show that these models give very accurate KPI projections and provide valuable insights into newly emerging trends, opportunities, and problems. This should lead to more intelligent, predictive, and responsive supply chains capable of adapting to future business environment. © 2014 Nenad Stefanovic.},

	abstract = {Global manufacturers have faced unprecedented cost pressures in China because of Chinese currency appreciation, rising labour costs, higher oil prices and reduced value-added tax rebates. This paper aims to reassess the decision of operating global manufacturing facilities in China. A mixed integer programming model is developed for a typical global manufacturing supply chain that includes production in the Pearl River Delta region and trade in Hong Kong. A case study with a footwear product is used to illustrate model application and present detailed analyses. The modelling results affirm the need of relocating labour-intensive production that mainly competes on low costs. Nevertheless, coastal China offers considerable benefits from industrial clustering and a logistics advantage in comparison with inland China and Asian countries where labour costs are still relatively low. Hong Kong remains a robust location choice for trade operations because of its favourable tax policies. Retaining production in China faces high risks from Chinese currency appreciation, while relocation to lower-cost Asian countries is more vulnerable to risks from high oil prices. An intermediate trade operation in Hong Kong can be used to hedge against risks from unfavourable tax policy changes at manufacturing locations. China has risen to an important position in global manufacturing because of its cost advantages. This paper analyzes the new phenomenon of dramatically increasing cost pressures in China. It develops a first-of-its-kind supply chain configuration model for the popular front-shop-back-factory business model in China. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

A palm biomass case study is developed in this paper to illustrate the functional clustering model. Production facilities are identified and processing hub allocation is determined in the case study. Two models are developed: (i) biomass supply network optimisation and synthesis and (ii) biomass supply network with functional clustering. The former acts as a base case for optimal supply network synthesis. The following reforms the former by integrating a functional clustering concept. The second model functionally clusters the industrial facilities based on their material interactions. Each cluster formed consists of a centralised processing hub, which acts as the backbone/seed of a functional cluster. Strategic locations of centralised processing hubs are determined and functional clusters are formed by optimisation modelling. Optimised biomass supply networks are developed from the optimisation activities. The optimisation result favours centralised processing hub formation. Lowered machinery capital investment and transportation cost are achieved in the functional clustered model. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Then we studied and compared their respective publishing behaviors in the blogosphere. Our analysis suggested that bloggers with different topical coverages do behave in different ways. Specialists generally make more contributions than generalists. Specialists also tend to publish more on weekdays, during business hours, and on a more regular basis. We also revealed that specialists also have different publishing behaviors, with only a small fraction creating a large "buzz" or producing a voluminous output.

The previous abnormal data analysis and processing way can not meet with the need of data processing. According to the survey of international famous consulting company (Gartner) for the "information overload", results show that more than 90% of the enterprises think the enterprise competitiveness is closely related to its information capacity. In order to obtain the useful information, we must analyze, process the data, and exclude "exception" data. So, it is very important to realize the detection of abnormal data. This paper presents the RFID supply an abnormal data analysis and processing system of RFID supply chain based on distance, rules and middleware technology.This system is divided into three levels: data processing layer, anomaly analysis lay and graphical display layer. Finally, through the performance analysis of the system, the effectiveness of the system has been verified. © 2014 SERSC.},

	abstract = {Health IT applications today generally incorporate patients as passive users or consumers of information rather than active individuals w ho, in concert with their providers, are motivated and jointly responsible for their ow n good health. This article uses the healthcare value chain concept [Porter and Teisberg, 2006] as a framework to identify gaps in patient-centered e-health applications. While patient diversity poses challenges similar to consumer diversity for application design, consumer-centric design is limiting for patient-centered e-health because patients should not simply consume health care; they need to interact at multiple stages, alter their behaviors, and actively participate. This article raises critical research questions specif ic to this challenge. It def ines a new term, "healthicant," to motivate a research focus on technology-enabled applications that support individuals responsible for their ow n health and well-being, and w ho seek appropriate assistance as needed to prevent, diagnose, prepare, intervene, rehabilitate, monitor, and manage their health throughout their lifetime. The article contrasts the objectives of healthicants with both healthcare providers (for w hom most health IT has been created) and more passive patients (for w hom current "patient-centered" applications are evolving), in order to identif y important gaps today. These include systems that support healthicant motivation, measurement, analysis, data mining, real-time personalized feedback, and multidirectional communication. © 2014 by the Association for Information Systems.},

Then, a novel interval type-2 fuzzy hybrid expert system is developed for demand forecasting. This system uses Fuzzy Disjunctive Normal Forms (FDNF) and Fuzzy Conjunctive Normal Forms (FCNF) for the aggregation of antecedents. An interval type- 2 fuzzy order policy is developed to determine orders in the supply chain. Then, the results of the proposed method are compared with the type-1 fuzzy expert system as well as the type-1 fuzzy time series method in the literature.

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the use of a new feature reduction technique with novelty detection on vibration and acoustic-emission sensors monitoring bearings mounted in the test benches of automotive manufacturers. Design/methodology/approach - Signals from standard accelerometers and acoustic-emission sensors were gathered from bearings operating under steady conditions on an accessory-drive test bench. The bearings under test were subject to a variety of faults including fretting. These signals were processed and reduced to standard feature vectors, the dimensionality of which was reduced using a new principal-component-like technique optimized for novelty detection. The reduced data were analyzed with a novelty detection technique called the Support Vector Data Descriptor. Findings - The classification results from these sensors, after being reduced with the proposed feature reduction technique, are substantially improved over those achievable with only standard novelty detection; nearly zero-percent classification error was achieved. Research limitations/implications - The feature reduction technique depends, in part, on the availability of the fault type in question - potentially violating the normal novelty detection assumption of limited abnormal data. This may require the manufacturer to gather real or simulated fault data prior to running tests. Practical implications - Incipient faults may be detectable at a much earlier stage in a manufacturer's component failure analysis. Test engineers may use this technique to reliably automate the fault detection process and enable improved root-cause analysis through the earlier identification of faults. Originality/value - The application of the feature reduction technique will provide manufacturers and researchers with a new means of improving fault detection in machinery components. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Performance evaluation of suppliers is increasingly recognized as a critical indicator in supply chain cooperation. Traditional performance evaluation methods have the problems of a simple buy/sell relation and in one's subjective views between manufacturers and suppliers, and they lack objective automatic evaluation processes in the supply chain considered. Statistical techniques used for evaluation rely on the restrictive assumptions of linear separability, multivariate normality, and independence of the predictive variables. Unfortunately, many of the common models of performance evaluation of suppliers violate these assumptions. The study proposes an integrated model by combining K-means clustering, feature selection, and the decision tree method into a single evaluation model to assess the performance of suppliers and simultaneously tackles the abovementioned shortcomings. The integrated model is illustrated with an empirical case study of a manufacturer for an original design manufacturer (ODM) to demonstrate the model performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms listed methods in terms of accuracy, and three redundant attributes can be eliminated from the empirical case. Furthermore, the extracted rules by the decision tree C4.5 algorithm form an automatic knowledge system for supplier performance evaluation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

One of the critical challenges faced by such decisions is the potential risk of leaking confidential information through shared suppliers and partners. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to decompose a product into several sub-components for mitigating the risk of Intellectual Property (IP) leakage caused by inferences in supply chains. A design structure matrix is employed to study the potential risk of IP leakage considering different types of interactions between product components. Based on such a matrix, a clustering algorithm is developed to decompose and allocate the product components regarding IP protection issue. This methodology can be considered as a decision support tool to help the manufacturer select a set of optimal suppliers while minimizing the information leakage risk and the manufacturing cost. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {An RFID technology is most important process in supply chain management. In order to know the movements of products in supply chain management, an RFID tag is attached to a product. If the product with an RFID tag moves or stays near the detection region, RFID readers will detect RFID tags information. If the data volume gets increased, the processing of such RFID data becomes complex and hence storing and retrieving data to be very challenging. Nowadays, the RFID data related research works, the complexity reduction on processing such RFID data remains a big challenge. Hence to avoid such negative aspects a new RFID data encoding scheme is proposed in the supply chain management. To reduce the complexity of the processing the RFID data's, or proposed method utilizing orthogonal transformation and optimization model during the raw data processing. Initially, the RFID data to be processed by the orthogonal transformation and that the data's are optimally clustered by the well renowned optimization technique is named as GA. After that, the clustered data's are encoded by exploiting the path encoding and order encoding schemes. Based on the path encoding scheme and the order encoding scheme, we devise a storage scheme that can process tracking queries and path oriented queries efficiently on an RDBMS. Finally, we propose a method that translates the queries to SQL queries. The proposed method is implemented and the queries are efficiently retrieved and the results are compared against the conventional RFID path encoding scheme. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

Consequently, companies adopt different supply chain risk management (SCRM) strategies to mitigate SC risks. The purpose of this paper is to explore SCRM strategies in Indian automobile industry and to classify automobile firms based on SCRM dimensions. Design/methodology/approach – A survey instrument on SCRM dimensions was designed and data were collected from 79 automobile firms. Principle component analysis (PCA) was performed on the collected data to derive the factors underlying SCRM dimensions. Further, cluster analysis using extracted factors as a clustering variate was performed to identify strategic groups from the given set of firms. Findings – PCA derived seven factors, namely: avoidance, supplier development, flexibility, risk pooling, redundancy, integration and control strategies. The surveyed firms were classified into two clusters as low and high SCRM level. Research limitations/implications – A limitation of this study is that data were collected from a single industry and in a single country. Practical implications – Understanding of SCRM dimensions shall increase the use of these dimensions and firms can mitigate negative effects of SC risks. The detailed operationalization of SCRM strategies highlights the importance of three strategies: avoidance, integration and supplier development. Managers’ understanding of SCRM strategies will improve the firm’s performance and business excellence. Originality/value – This research empirically validates SCRM strategies and investigates how these create differences among firms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Total footprints are the sum of direct and indirect footprints where the direct footprints only consider the burdening of the environment, whilst the total footprints consider both the burdening and unburdening of the environment. This dimensionality reduction method is applied during a demonstration case study of regional supply chains regarding the evaluations of different total environmental footprints. This case study indicates that this simplified version of the Representative Objectives Method is easy to apply and enables the user to more easily understand multi-objective optimisation solutions.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to advance supply chain network theory by applying theoretical and empirical developments in complex network literature to the context of supply chains as complex adaptive systems. The authors synthesize these advancements to gain an understanding of the network properties underlying efficient supply chains. To develop a suitable theory of supply chain networks, the authors look to mirror the properties of complex network models with real-world supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The authors review complex network literature drawn from multiple disciplines in top scientific journals. From this interdisciplinary review a series of propositions are developed around supply chain complexity and adaptive phenomena. Findings: This paper proposes that the structure of efficient supply chains follows a "scale-free" network. This proposal emerges from arguments that the key properties of efficient supply chains are a short characteristic path length, a high clustering coefficient and a power law connectivity distribution. Research limitations/implications: The authors' discussion centres on applying advances found in recent complex network literature. Hence, the need is noted to empirically validate the series of propositions developed in this paper in a supply chain context. Practical implications: If efficient supply chains resemble a scale-free network, then managers can derive a number of implications. For example, supply chain resilience is derived by the presence of hub firms. To reduce the vulnerability of supply chains to cascading failures, it is recognized that managers could build in redundancy, undertake a multi-sourcing strategy or intermediation between hub firms. Originality/value: This paper advances supply chain network theory. It offers a novel understanding of supply chains as complex adaptive systems and, in particular, that efficient and resilient supply chain systems resemble a scale-free network. In addition, it provides a series of propositions that allow modelling and empirical research to proceed. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {A company must purchase a lot of diverse components and raw material from different upstream suppliers to manufacture or assemble its products. Under this situation the supplier selection has become a critical issue for the purchasing department.The selection of suppliers depends on number of criteria and the challenge is to optimize selection process based on critical criteria and select the best supplier(s). During supplier selection process initial screening of potential suppliers from a large set is vital and the determination of prospective supplier is largely dependent on the criteria chosen of such pre-qualification. In the literature, many judgments based methods are proposed and derived criteria selection from the opinion of either the customers or the experts. All these techniques use the knowledge and experience of the decision makers. These methods inherit certain degree of uncertainty due to complex supply chain structure. The extraction of hidden knowledge is one of the most important tools to address such uncertainty and data mining is one such concept to account for such uncertainty and it has been found applicable in many scenarios. The proposed research aims to introduce a data mining approach, to discover the hidden relationships among the supplier's pre-qualification data with the overall supplier rating that have been derived after observation of previously executed work for a period of time. It provides an overview that how supplier's initial strength influence its final work performance. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

If enterprises can achieve the objective of providing customers with services in accordance with their individual needs, they are more likely to obtain high customer satisfaction. This study selected multinational 3C distributors in Taiwan as the subjects and their internal MIS (management information system) databases as data sources. Data mining was employed to screen important and relevant information from the MIS databases. The key factors affecting the service quality of customized logistics, as obtained from the benchmarking platform of cost information, were used as the contents of a hierarchical structure. After the information was input into the linear planning model, better solutions were obtained. Moreover, the results were saved in the ABC (activity based costing)-KMDSS (knowledge management decision support system) database. The rules for enterprise operation in the knowledge database, together with data from the ABC-KMDSS database, were used for the CBR (casebased reasoning) method of knowledge reasoning to determine the proper decision-making for logistics services of relevant customized products.© 2013 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.},

	abstract = {Modularity has been widely used and studied in industry and academia. Modular products consist of detachable modules that can be manufactured, assembled, and serviced separately. Some module components (or overall modules themselves) can be reusable, recyclable, or remanufacturable after reaching the end of their original life cycle. The reverse supply chain represents all operations related to reuse of products, components, and their materials. Recently, environmental issues including energy usage and the carbon footprint (CF) implications of products have attracted attention. Thus, designing product modular architectures that consider not only the interactions across components but also component end-of-life (EOL) options (i.e., reuse, recycle, and disposal) has become important. In this article, we compare results of two modularity methods for their CF implications. The environmental impact (i.e., CF generation during assembly or manufacturing) was analyzed by dissecting a refrigerator and using SimaPro software for the recovered data. Significantly, a new factor-the carbon footprint-is introduced into the analysis of modularization comparisons. We discuss the implications of the differences in terms of CF for the reverse supply chain. © KEDGE BS.},

A major challenge is to develop a relatively inexpensive and automated forecasting engine that guarantees a desired forecasting accuracy. Times series decomposition and Forecast combination have been two classes of methods that have attracted the interest of recent researchers. One solution has been to use decomposition followed by recombining to form a very large number of forecasting models Further many recent papers present Data Mining based methods to intelligently discover a subset of methods from a large list that can be used in combination for sales demand forecasting. These methods are computationally expensive and prohibitive if they are applied to each individual time series in a retail organization. In this paper we present a novel technique to identify similar sales series and efficiently use the best combination of methods learnt for one series to forecast for the entire set of similar series.},

This paper proposes a framework to assess collaborative solutions in the context of logistics and freight transport, as well as to describe the links between freight transport and supply chain management in terms of collaboration techniques. First die main concepts of collaborative logistics in the distribution and transport fields are presented, highlighting die links between collaboration, freight transport and supply chain management. Then, the method to assess collaborative logistics and freight transport solutions is proposed. This mediod includes a design scheme, a hierarchic clustering technique and a dominance analysis method to unify the assessment of each individual and prepare collaborative research for a common solution. After that, the method is applied to the assessment of five scenarios derived from a real situation for the urban area of Lyon (France) to illustrate how difficult convergence towards consensus is. The results show that a global optimal solution for the entire set of stakeholders is not easy to identify, and how the proposed method can be helpful for decision makers to achieve a consensus of common objectives.},

The facilities are grouped into clusters for industrial management based on their material interactions. The material supply and process network is optimised economically and its environmental emission is taken into consideration. The processing facilities are interacted through industrial symbiosis approach. The flexibility of the model is improved with the model's capacity to allocate external interruption (e.g., potential investments).

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine logistics infrastructure, trade differences, and environmental and social equity factors, for a set of 89 countries. Design/methodology/approach: Following recent work which uses secondary data sources for supply chain research at the country-level, data were obtained from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund databases. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to compute country-level efficiencies and ANOVA was used to do regional comparisons. Findings: The analysis shed light on country-level dimensions of logistics infrastructure and trade performance. It also provided insights regarding environmental (e.g. CO2 emissions) and social equity (e.g. health expenditure) dimensions for different regions. Research limitations/implications: Panel data rather than longitudinal data were used to draw the conclusions. A more exhaustive study could consider a multi-year timeframe. A limited number of dimensions were examined. As the study was exploratory, further work could consider a more extensive number of dimensions. Practical implications: The study has important implications for policy makers, since the attractiveness of various resource endowments like those considered here (environmental, social, supply chain logistics) can be seen to be associated with trade performance. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies to explore efficiency differences (enacted through DEA and ANOVA analyses), differentiating the research from the usual country clustering approaches. It also contributes to the understanding of differences between countries from a macro perspective, which provides insights for firms intending to expand their supply chains. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Decision making is a core problem in Supply Chains. A large number of studies in literature have reported various decision making techniques based on customers' requirements. Taking into account high risk transactions in virtual Supply Chain market, trust is a very critical element and should be treated as an important reference when customers try to select proper suppliers. Recently, a great effort has been carried out to develop decision making based on trust and reputation. However, these research works still stay on the stage of theoretical research. This paper presents and implements a multi-criteria decision making approach based on trust and reputation in Supply Chain. Firstly, this paper defines general trust indicators in real Supply Chain settings, and designs a multi-dimensional trust and reputation model. This paper also introduces K-mean clustering algorithm to remove unfair rating scores. Then, based on this trust and reputation model, we propose a multi-criteria decision making approach based on variable weights and satisfaction principle. In order to validate the performance of this approach, we simulate a practical Supply Chain setting with multi-agents platform. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed trust and reputation model can effectively filter unfair ratings from those customers who did lie and the proposed multi-criteria decision making method can help customers make right decisions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The study aimed at analyzing the trend of the GSCM and CLSC researches from 2000 to 2010. The contribution of the study included the following two points. First, the study found a new way of literature survey by using the text mining method in order to explore the research trend. Second, the study applied the SVM (Support Vector Machine) and random forests classification analysis to explore the relationship between the GSCM and CLSC research trends.},

Most of the approaches presented so far have somehow a limited scope, as they focus on minimizing the emitted greenhouse gases as unique criterion, neglecting the damage caused in other impact categories. In this work, we address the multiobjective design of bioethanol SCs considering several life cycle assessment impacts. To overcome the numerical difficulties of dealing with several objective functions, we investigate the application of a rigorous mixed-integer linear programming-based dimensionality reduction method that minimizes the error of omitting objectives. The usefulness of this approach is tested through its application to the design of a bioethanol/sugar SC in Argentina, in which five environmental objectives are simultaneously optimized along with the net present value. The proposed method makes it possible to reduce the number of environmental indicators, thereby facilitating the calculation and analysis of the Pareto solutions. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

(2014) used real-options theory to quantify the relationship between mismatch cost and demand volatility, demonstrating that the marginal value of time increases with demand volatility, and with the volatility of demand volatility. We use the de Treville et al. model to explore the marginal value of time in three industrial supply chains facing relatively low demand volatility, extending the model to incorporate factors such as tender-loss risk, demand clustering in an order-up-to model, and use of a target fill rate that exceeded the newsvendor profit-maximizing order quantity. Each of these factors substantially increases the marginal value of time. In all of the companies under study, managers had underestimated the mismatch costs arising from lead time, so had underinvested in cutting lead times. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted an online survey of North American SMEs and obtained 229 responses. They utilized several statistical methods, including cluster analysis and profile analysis, to test five hypotheses. Findings - The TOE framework, supplemented with interorganizational factors, provides a valid theoretical guideline to study firms' B2BEC usage patterns. Three distinct types of B2BEC usage patterns - E-Limiteds, E-Leaders, and E-Laggards - emerged. Different sets of contextual factors contribute to the formation of these three patterns of B2BEC adoption. Higher levels of B2BEC usage result in stronger firm performance. Research limitations/implications - Future clustering variables could be more specific. The effects of other potential contextual factors should also be explored by future studies. This study can be replicated in other countries to determine whether the findings can be generalized. Practical implications - In light of the potential performance improvements that B2BEC adoption offers, managers should assess the risks associated with maintaining their current speed of e-business deployment versus the risks associated with escalating it. Organizations that have been more reactive should consider how well or ill their sluggish approach prepares them for navigating the inevitability of increasing sophistication in supply chain management. Originality/value - Limited empirical research exists on theB2BECusage patterns of NorthAmerican SMEs, the contextual factors that motivate them to adopt different B2BEC technologies in their supply chains, and how each of these usage patterns affects their performance. The current study contributes to the literature by shedding light on these issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The research initially finds that there is currently little or no work that explores sustainable or green outsourcing, other than in an information technology context. This lack of research on sustainable outsourcing practice in the industrial organisation sector led to the development of this research study. This exploratory study used a qualitative survey tool to investigate current industrial practice. Manufacturing managers in 57 organisations formed the survey sample. The data were analysed by comparison and clustering of responses of survey participants. This study contributes five key findings that demonstrate current industrial practice which includes: 32% of respondents state that sustainability is not a factor in their outsourcing decision making and 65% of small- and medium-sized enterprises had never heard of the 'triple bottom line' concept. Future research needs are identified and proposed highlighting that urgent development of research is required in outsourcing performance measurement and also in considering sustainability as a new manufacturing competitive priority. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Motivated by the limited number of related approaches and an obvious need for applicable methods, our article focuses on this research topic. We present an interactive approach for obtaining cost function estimations from a decision maker. As a result of previous experiments, a knowledge-based Genetic Programming approach for rough function approximations is presented first. After that, a novel algorithm for reaching better convergence of the roughly approximated cost functions is described. Constituting the central research topic of this article, different interactive strategies for questioning a decision maker are then implemented and computationally tested. A decision support system integrating both aspects is illustrated and numerical results are presented. It is shown that the quality of computational results first depends on the quality of decision maker's answers. Second, looking at different questioning strategies in detail, cost function convergence seems to be reached faster, if decision maker statements are added to the database step- and not group-wise. © 2013 - IOS Press and the author(s).

Data mining methods are useful to cope with such big data streams, and they are well developed in the literature. But these methods are not often applied to logistical state data. Without knowledge of the processes, the results of the algorithms cannot be understood. Therefore, the objective of this work is to introduce a general concept to model and to analyse logistical state data, in order to find irregularities and their causes and dependences.

The purpose of this study is to identify relevant product features related to sustainable development in this context, and use the choice of mobile phone as an example in measuring their importance. Design/methodology/approach: The study used two different methods (qualitative and quantitative) in two phases. First it organized focus-group discussions in order to identify the features of sustainability that affect the choice of a mobile phone. The most significant features served as a starting point for the choice of attributes to be included in the final step, choice-based conjoint analysis (CBC), which assesses respondents' value functions by means of latent class clustering. Between the two major phases it carried out two additional pre-tests in order to reduce the number of attributes. Findings: The results provide fundamental information concerning the relative importance of sustainability features in the selection of a mobile phone. The study identified four different clusters of purchasers: updaters, budgeters, environmentalists, and long-life users. According to the findings, some consumers are willing to pay a premium for sustainability features. The authors discuss the potential implications of the results in the context of supply chain design. Originality/value: The literature on supply chain management tends to see the consumers as a "black box". This paper reports the first results of opening this box by linking the supply chain perspective to consumer choice behavior. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Digital commodities are delivered worldwide through a Global Supply Chain Network of providers. These are usually interconnected via Local Supply Chain Networks, based around Internet Exchange Points, the physical places where most digital exchanges take place. Providers compete both for business and final customers, while cooperating the exchanges of information flows composing the digital commodities, to provide a complete, end to end, service to final users. A myriad of interconnection decisions form the connectivity's architecture of this Global Supply Chain Network, designing the rules of the business game played by the operators. This paper, using a dataset of interconnection protocols over 195 Internet Exchange Points across the World, focuses on the relationship between a provider's connectivity and clustering: the mutual connectivity among the operators this provider is connected to. The strategic relevance of this relationship between connectivity and clustering is clear: the better connected a provider is, the easier it is to deliver the digital commodities with high quality and low costs and, when the neighbours of a provider are less interconnected among themselves, it is easier, for the provider, to exert its bargaining power over them. We estimate an econometric model finding that the continental location of an Internet Exchange Point has a significant effect on the sign of the elasticity between clustering and connectivity. This indicates that Local Supply Chain Networks display significant differences in their clusters of integration, hierarchical organization and complexity, depending on whether they are based in Europe, North America or Rest of the World. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The prevalent volatile business environment is exerting pressure on companies to change fast for survival- a need to be strategically agile. This need is more pronounced for supply chains of companies as at least two organizations have to collaborate, communicate, and coordinate their supply chain activities effectively to adequately address environment threats and take advantage of opportunities. Strategic agility is an essential requirement for supply chains to survive in the competitive environment. Strategic agility is comprised of three dimensions — strategic sensitivity, strategic response and collective capabilities. Companies can take advantage of the advances in information technology and information systems to enhance strategic agility. This research highlights how information systems (IS) can bolster the three dimensions of strategic agility in supply chains. A normative description approach is utilized for two companies — IKEA and Kesko to analyze the role of IS in SC strategic agility. The results show that IS, such as advances in social technologies, could be utilized for enhancing strategic agility dimension of collective capabilities. IS, such as data mining systems are vital for promoting strategic sensitivity with supply chain partners downstream i.e., customers. For supply chain upstream, where products are formulated, IS such as business process management systems are required to support strategic response. ©, Copyright Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {With a growing awareness of carbon footprints and their impact on environmental degradation, many firms hope to streamline their reverse logistics (RL) operations involving end-of-use products. However, managing end-of-use products can be extremely challenging due to inherent complexity involved in the collection, sorting, transhipment, and processing of these products. Despite numerous challenges, the efficient handling of these products can be a source of competitive advantages. In this regard, a plastic recycling industry in Southern India is no exception. This industry often copes with the problem of picking up recyclable plastic bottles using private collecting agents, transferring those bottles to the initial collection points (ICPs), and then transhipping and consolidating them at the centralized return centres (CRCs) for final shipments to the processing centres where these bottles were treated for recycling. This problem can be further complicated with the dilemma of finding the most ideal locations of ICPs and CRCs and the optimal routing of vehicles serving ICPs and CRCs such that the total RL cost is minimized. To aid the industry in dealing with such RL problems, we developed a mathematical model and then evaluated the performances of that model with the actual data obtained from a case study of the Indian company. Given a lack of efforts in combining the location-routing problem with the balanced allocation problem in the closed-loop supply chain network, the main contribution of this paper includes the simultaneous consideration of location, allocation, and routing decisions. In addition, this paper is one of the first to consider incentive payments, the quality level of products, and multiple types of products. © 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.},

	abstract = {The problems of facility location and the allocation of demand points to facilities are crucial research issues in spatial data analysis and urban planning. It is very important for an organization or governments to best locate its resources and facilities and efficiently manage resources to ensure that all demand points are covered and all the needs are met. Most of the recent studies, which focused on solving facility location problems by performing spatial clustering, have used the Euclidean distance between two points as the dissimilarity function. Natural obstacles, such as mountains and rivers, can have drastic impacts on the distance that needs to be traveled between two geographical locations. While calculating the distance between various supply chain entities (including facilities and demand points), it is necessary to take such obstacles into account to obtain better and more realistic results regarding location-allocation. In this article, new models were presented for location of urban facilities while considering geographical obstacles at the same time. In these models, three new distance functions were proposed. The first function was based on the analysis of shortest path in linear network, which was called SPD function. The other two functions, namely PD and P2D, were based on the algorithms that deal with robot geometry and route-based robot navigation in the presence of obstacles. The models were implemented in ArcGIS Desktop 9.2 software using the visual basic programming language. These models were evaluated using synthetic and real data sets. The overall performance was evaluated based on the sum of distance from demand points to their corresponding facilities. Because of the distance between the demand points and facilities becoming more realistic in the proposed functions, results indicated desired quality of the proposed models in terms of quality of allocating points to centers and logistic cost. Obtained results show promising improvements of the allocation, the logistics costs and the response time. It can also be inferred from this study that the P2D-based model and the SPD-based model yield similar results in terms of the facility location and the demand allocation. It is noted that the P2D-based model showed better execution time than the SPD-based model. Considering logistic costs, facility location and response time, the P2D-based model was appropriate choice for urban facility location problem considering the geographical obstacles. © 2014, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The emerging biobased economy is causing shifts from mineral fossil oil based resources towards renewable resources. Because of market mechanisms, current and new industries utilising renewable commodities, will attempt to secure their supply of resources. Cellulose is among these commodities, where large scale competition can be expected and already is observed for the traditional industries such as the paper industry. Cellulose and lignocellulosic raw materials (like wood and non-wood fibre crops) are being utilised in many industrial sectors. Due to the initiated transition towards biobased economy, these raw materials are intensively investigated also for new applications such as 2nd generation biofuels and 'green' chemicals and materials production (Clark, 2007; Lange, 2007; Petrus & Noordermeer, 2006; Ragauskas et al.; 2006; Regalbuto, 2009). As lignocellulosic raw materials are available in variable quantities and qualities, unnecessary competition can be avoided via the choice of suitable raw materials for a target application. For example, utilisation of cellulose as carbohydrate source for ethanol production (Kabir Kazi et al.; 2010) avoids the discussed competition with easier digestible carbohydrates (sugars, starch) deprived from the food supply chain. Also for cellulose use as a biopolymer several different competing markets can be distinguished. It is clear that these applications and markets will be influenced by large volume shifts. The world will have to reckon with the increase of competition and feedstock shortage (land use/biodiversity) (van Dam, de Klerk-Engels, Struik, & Rabbinge, 2005). It is of interest-in the context of sustainable development of the bioeconomy-to categorize the already available and emerging lignocellulosic resources in a matrix structure. When composing such "cellulose resource matrix" attention should be given to the quality aspects as well as to the available quantities and practical possibilities of processing the feedstock and the performance in the end-application. The cellulose resource matrix should become a practical tool for stakeholders to make choices regarding raw materials, process or market. Although there is a vast amount of scientific and economic information available on cellulose and lignocellulosic resources, the accessibility for the interested layman or entrepreneur is very difficult and the relevance of the numerous details in the larger context is limited. Translation of science to practical accessible information with modern data management and data integration tools is a challenge. Therefore, a detailed matrix structure was composed in which the different elements or entries of the matrix were identified and a tentative rough set up was made. The inventory includes current commodities and new cellulose containing and raw materials as well as exotic sources and specialties. Important chemical and physical properties of the different raw materials were identified for the use in processes and products. When available, the market data such as price and availability were recorded. Established and innovative cellulose extraction and refining processes were reviewed. The demands on the raw material for suitable processing were collected. Processing parameters known to affect the cellulose properties were listed. Current and expected emerging markets were surveyed as well as their different demands on cellulose raw materials and processes. The setting up of the cellulose matrix as a practical tool requires two steps. Firstly, the reduction of the needed data by clustering of the characteristics of raw materials, processes and markets and secondly, the building of a database that can provide the answers to the questions from stakeholders with an indicative character. This paper describes the steps taken to achieve the defined clusters of most relevant and characteristic properties. These data can be expanded where required. More detailed specification can be obtained from the background literature and handbooks. Where gaps of information are identified, the research questions can be defined that will require further investigation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Motivated by a lack of studies in graduate level supply chain education, this research aims to explore trends in supply chain-related graduate programmes in Europe and to propose a framework for designing such programmes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors determine "knowledge" and "skills" areas applicable to supply chain management (SCM) education and analyse supply chain-related graduate programmes published by the European Logistics Association in 2004. They revisit the same programmes in 2011 to determine the recent situation and the trends. The authors use cluster analysis to reveal the similarities and differences among these programmes. Findings: The authors find two distinct clusters: focused and diversified. Focused programmes offer modules in knowledge and skills areas apart from SCM at a negligible level and place more emphasis on SCM in 2011 when compared to 2004. Diversified programmes show a similar increase in the emphasis on SCM with more variety in the knowledge and skills areas. Research limitations/implications: The authors' findings are based on SCM programmes delivered in Europe and over two discrete time periods. Future research should seek to extend this analysis to other continents with larger samples and incorporate the industry perspective to determine the potential gap between what programmes offer and what industry requires. Practical implications: SCM-related graduate programmes continue to redefine themselves. Clustering predominantly serves the universities in re-assessing and re-engineering their programmes, helps prospective graduates in their selection process and assists managers in their recruitment practices. Originality/value: This paper establishes a baseline for assessing SCM-related graduate programmes with respect to the knowledge and skills they offer and introduces a framework that may serve as a starting point for the design and positioning of such programmes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Several trends that affect the manufacturing of sophisticated goods-increasing international fragmentation of production, and lean and modular process technologies-have increased the importance of proximity in the supply chain. We use the case of the European automotive industry to simultaneously evaluate the relative importance of three dimensions: geographical, cultural, and relational proximity. Using a rich and novel data set, we find that carmakers value some aspects of each dimension independently in their sourcing strategy. The estimates indicate which proximity measures provide the largest (independent) benefits, but also that the positive effects the literature has attributed to some measures tend to reflect past relationships rather than predict new ones. In particular, co-location and a low cultural distance should be interpreted as outcomes of a sourcing strategy, not as predictors for sourcing success. Finally, we investigate to what extent firms from different countries follow different strategies, and which choices suppliers can make to boost their attractiveness as outsourcing partners. © 2013 Academy of International Business.},

As a prominent higher-order statistical analysis technique, ICA is capable of extracting relevant features from IR data. The latest applications and the extended algorithms of ICA have been elucidated for the purposes of classification and identification of counterfeit electronic parts.

This paper describes emerging electronic partnerships between players in developing electronic marketspaces and identifies typical data flows between such players, with an analysis of the potential role of data mining and intelligent agent technology. By identifying the complex nature of information flows between the vast numbers of economic entities, we identify opportunities for applying data mining techniques that can lead to knowledge discovery.

By increasing the complexity of the decision making in dynamic competitive environment, managers need relevant strategic plans for their firms. In this paper, a new framework for strategic formulation based on clustering approach has been proposed to cope with these intricacies. After exploring internal and external factors influencing the goals of the organizational departments, the goal-factor matrices are formed based on their correlations. A clustering approach is applied to integrate goal-factor matrices to fulfill incorporate interactions among departments. Strategies would be formulated for clusters instead of departments individually or as organization totally. In fact, management by objective (MBO) has been substituted by management by cluster (MBC). The capability and usefulness of the proposed framework are shown through a case study in National Iranian Oil Company Training Center. Results indicate that the proposed strategic formulation outperforms other approaches and is very promising not only for solving the organization's problem, but also is appropriate for utilizing in other corporate organizations. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The presence of Staphylococcus aureus in raw milk can represent a potential threat to human health, due to the introduction of pathogenic strains into dairy food supply chain. The present study was performed to investigate the genetic variation among S. aureus strains isolated from bulk tank goat's milk. The virulence profiles were also assessed to link the isolates with the potential source of milk contamination. A population study was performed on 60 strains using distance-based methods such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and the output was analyzed using Structure statistical software (University of Chicago; http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html). This Bayesian clustering model tool allows one to assign individuals into a population with no predefined structure. In order to assess partition of genetic variability among isolates, groups obtained by Structure were also investigated using analysis of molecular variance. S. aureus was recovered in 60 out of 78 samples (76.9%) collected from 26 farms. According to PFGE analysis, the strains were divided into 25 different pulsotypes and grouped into two main clusters. Restriction profiles, analyzed by Structure, allowed us to identify two distinct S. aureus genetic groups. Within each group, the strains showed a high coefficient of membership. A great part of genetic variability was attributable to within-groups variation. On the basis of the virulence profile, 45% of the isolates were linked to "animal" biovar, while 6.7% could be assigned to "human" biovar. Out of 60 strains, 27 were characterized by in vitro production of either enterotoxins A (5.0%), C (38.3%), or D (1.7%). The present study showed a high prevalence of bulk tank goat's milk contamination with S. aureus of animal origin. The presence in goat's milk of S. aureus strains able to produce enterotoxins and their potential introduction into dairy chain may represent a serious threat to human health. © 2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

Reducing the usage of a single material in a value chain may require ingenuity and wide cooperation, but conceptually it is not a problem. When the problem stretches to several resources in changing circumstances, we have to understand the linkages between resources and the power, and the influence of each resource in decision-making in different settings. In this paper, we concisely go from the time dimension to a very short history of resource thinking, and then introduce our resource convergence concept. Using text mining on a sample of articles linking different resources, we show in a 'visual literature review' how resource convergence emerges from unrelated texts. To demonstrate one new method under the resource convergence umbrella, we use a case example with our Resource Power Index method. In our opinion, mastering complexity will be the key to solving the challenges we are facing, and mastering resource convergence and translating it into material efficiency is one of the central problems. What we show in this paper is a core framework and some details of the direction we see as worth pursuing. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Traditional simulation modelling focuses upon the analysis of steady-state data. This focus may not be appropriate, however, for the study of transient responses-data reflecting some form of disruption or change in the system norms. Transient responses are often encountered when dealing with new product introductions, changes in production systems, or supply chain disruptions. In these situations, it is the transient response, how the system responds to these changes as well as the tactics and strategies used to deal with these changes, that tend to be of the greatest interest. Unfortunately, current approaches that focus on analysing such responses are limited. This paper introduces a new approach for analysing transient responses-one that merges outlier detection, a time series analysis tool, with simulation modelling. This combined approach allows the researcher to identify those factors that have the greatest impact upon operations during these transient conditions. Using a simulated supply chain disruption to illustrate the potential of the approach, it is shown that the new approach expands the applicability of simulation and enables certain types of problems to be investigated with confidence not previously provided. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.},

In this paper, we first dispersed the continuous attribute information based on both entropy and importance of attribute to preprocess the data of heat-supply network. Then we exploited three kinds of algorithm for data mining, namely, classification and prediction based on the decision tree, cluster analysis based on the K-mean partition and association rules mining based on the frequent itemset model. Finally, we established forecasting model combining the results of three aforementioned mining schemes. The model was then embedded into the prediction module of present system and the results demonstrated the proposed scheme can improve the prediction performance efficiently. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the vital parts of the business programs are the Data warehouses and the Data mining techniques. Especially these are vital in the RFID application which brings a revolution in business programs. Manufacturing, the logistics distribution and various stages of supply chains, retail store and quality management applications are involved in the RFID technology in business. A large volume of temporal and spatial data is generated by the ubiquitous computing and sensor networks of RFID and these are often generated with noises and duplicates. The noises and duplicates in the RFID data declare the need of an effective data warehousing system. The warehousing system has the responsibility to provide proper data cleaning technique to clean the dirty data which occurs in the applications. Also, the cleaned data has to be transformed and to be loaded properly so that they can be stored in the database with minimum space requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel data cleaning, transformation and loading technique which makes the data warehousing system employed for any RFID applications more effective. The chosen RFID application is tracking of goods in warehouses using RFID tags and readers, one of the significant RFID applications. The data cleaning is performed based on the probability of each RFID tag's response and the window size which is made adaptive. The window size changes on the basis of the occurrence of the dirty data and hence the cleaning is more effective. The purified data is transformed in a special structure in such a way that the ware house can have only the tag IDs which are under transaction and the time of interrogation in the size of bits. The transformed data are loaded into the warehouse using the proposed loading technique in a dedicated tabular format.},

This paper proposes a model for strategic transport planning involving a network wide intermodal transport system. The system determines the spatio-temporal states of road based freight networks (unimodal) and future traffic flow in definite time intervals. This information is processed to devise efficient scheduling plans by coordinating and connecting existing rail transport schedules to road based freight systems (intermodal). The traffic flow estimation is performed by kernel based support vector mechanisms while mixed integer programming (MIP) is used to optimize schedules for intermodal transport network by considering various costs and additional capacity constraints. The model has been successfully applied to an existing Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) distribution network in India with encouraging results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {One of the most challenging problem for optimizing supply chain is the coordination of production and distribution decision. This paper considers a customer clustering problem for a large scale production, inventory and distribution problem (PIDRP) where the demands at customers need to be satisfied in each period in the planning horizon with limited production and transportation capacity. The clustering aspect of the distribution problem is an important component for reducing complexity of the dispatch operation especially when the number of customers is large.In this paper an enhanced clustering model that considers factors (e.g. demand pattern and holding costs) that could affect the operating cost throughout the planning horizon is introduced. The algorithm based on a reactive tabu search for solving the clustering problem for PIDRP is proposed. A novel feature of the algorithm is to create adaptive core clusters which are used in the clustering process instead of the original data points. With this approach the complexity of the original problem is reduced and the proposed algorithm is able to solve the PIDRP much more efficient. Computational testing on instances up to 200 customers and 20 time periods demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm in term of solution quality and runtime. Special cases of the problem are also considered to provide useful insights on how to apply the model with different settings of model's parameters. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

It was expected that solutions could be found to make new contributions through the verification of special economic zones (SEZs). Design/methodology/approach – Using manufacturers in Taiwan’s SEZs as the subjects, this study explored the impact on the obtainment of professional human resources after the formation of industrial clusters in SEZs, through conducting and empirical study with a questionnaire survey. Findings – The professional human resources are the essential factor for the formation of industrial clusters and the improvement of competitiveness. This study also confirmed that industries can have professional human resources by industrial clustering and that this will produce a positive impact on the enterprise clustering relationships, which can also have a positive impact on firm’s performance and can enhance the enterprise’s competitive advantage. Practical implications – Industrial clustering is the key factor to attract professional human resources; industrial clusters can enhance firm’s performance; and professional human resources affect firm’s performance of enterprises. Originality/value – No study has discussed the topic of clusters from the perspective of SEZs also including six export processing zone (EPZ) parks in Taiwan. This study discussed the topic using theories relating to clustering and human resources. The formation of industrial clusters can result in higher competitiveness in the face of the global market. The EPZ industrial cluster provides an excellent investment environment. Coupled with one-stop express services and geographic advantage, the land-use rate is up to 97 per cent and the per hectare output value amounts to NTD 3.2 billion, setting a successful example of an industrial cluster. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, almost all kind of electronic devices leave traces of their movements (e.g. smartphone, GPS devices and so on). Thus, the huge number of this "tiny" data sources leads to the generation of massive data streams of geo-referenced data. As a matter of fact, the effective analysis of such amounts of data is challenging, since the possibility to extract useful information from this peculiar kind of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, hand-off in cellular networks, supply chain management. Moreover, spatial data streams management poses new challenges both for their proper definition and acquisition, thus making the overall process harder than for classical point data. In particular, we are interested in solving the problem of effective trajectory data streams clustering, that revealed really intriguing as we deal with sequential data that have to be properly managed due to their ordering. We propose a framework that allow data pre-elaboration in order to make the mining step more effective. As for every data mining tool, the experimental evaluation is crucial, thus we performed several tests on real world datasets that confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Diversity of agricultural systems can be described at different scales in terms of three main types of variables: technical management of cropping systems, farming systems and food supply chains. We focus on the diversity of technical management routes (TMRs), defined as logical successions of technical options (TOs) designed by the farmers. The study, comparison and assessment of this great diversity of complex routes are impossible with classical agronomic experiments or exhaustive assessments such as life cycle assessment (LCA). Hence, the selection of representative cases is necessary. Multidimensional data analysis methods permit the characterization of a diversity of TMRs and the construction of typologies but do not allow the consideration of the specific associations of TOs constituting the various TMRs.The aim of this paper is threefold: (i) to propose a new combined method, "Typ-iti", to classify the field TMRs of farmers, to identify key TO associations and to select the most relevant cases for study; (ii) to test this method on vineyard management diversity using a panel of vineyard fields of Loire Valley producers; and (iii) to discuss the capability of the proposed Typ-iti method for use in the characterization and selection of cases of other agricultural systems at diverse scales.The example developed in this paper is the selection of vineyard management cases for grape LCA combined with grape quality evaluation. The cases were selected to represent the regional diversity of management practices. A detailed on-farm survey of management methods was performed on a diverse range of wine production estates in the Middle Loire Valley. The Typ-iti method was constructed and implemented on the survey database. It combines a multidimensional analysis of qualitative survey data and typology and partitioning (clustering) associated with data mining methods (frequent pattern mining search and association rules).The surveyed sample was partitioned into 5 types of management practices, 2 of which were organic and 3 conventional. The partitioning was driven primarily by choices involving pest management and floor management. Each type was characterized by specific TOs, specific associations of TOs and remarkable TMRs. The cases were chosen on the basis of these 3 parameters.The Typ-iti method can be applied to other crops and at different scales; the only limitation is the availability of precise information on the practices used by farmers in their fields. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This contribution presents a novel dimensionality reduction method - a Representative Objectives Method (ROM) - applied to environmental footprints, by which the number of environmental footprints within the multiobjective optimization (MOO) is reduced to a minimum number of representative ones. The number of footprints is reduced according to similarities among those footprints showing similar behavior. The proposed method consists of three steps: (i) generation of solution points for analyzing similarities among footprints, (ii) identification of similarities among footprints, and the selection of representative footprints (those footprints that show similar behavior are grouped into subsets, each subset's representative footprint is then selected), and (iii) the performing of MOO for maximizing profit with respect to the representative footprints. In this way, the dimensionality of the criteria within the MOO can be significantly reduced. Rather than obtaining the remaining footprints through correlations among the representative " independent" footprints, they are read directly from Pareto solutions. The presented dimensionality reduction method is applicable in cases when the model is known. The presented approach is illustrated using a demonstration case study of different biomass energy supply chains. The similarities among carbon (CF), energy (EF), water (WF), water pollution (WPF), and land footprints (LF) were investigated, from which only two representative footprints, CF and WF, were selected. This case study indicated that using this novel approach makes MOO more practical for real life problems. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The increase in international trade, the advances in technology, the growing importance of the emerging markets are the main factors that have contributed to the explosion of counterfeiting experienced in recent years, estimated to be valued at about 5-7 per cent of the world trade. The luxury industry in Italy has been particularly hard hit and most brands nowadays are urgently looking for demand-side and supply-side strategies to track and control the phenomenon. The aim of this paper is to provide a supply chain view of counterfeiting and illegitimate trade phenomena, in a supply chain risk management perspective, to define and illuminate the interaction of the legitimate and the illegitimate supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The paper introduces the LISC model to represent and include all the illegitimate trade phenomena under analysis such as pure counterfeiting, factory overruns, grey and parallel market, supply chain infiltrations, product diversion and sale of stolen goods Findings: The interrelations between legitimate and illegitimate supply chains are crucial to approach counterfeiting issue and define which illegitimate trade paths are more harmful to companies and customers. Research limitations/implications: The first limitation of the work is that the illegitimate trade categories defined in this paper mainly rely on data and phenomena collected from secondary sources that have not yet been directly observed by the authors. The second one is that a specific focus on high-end fashion industry was employed throughout this work: further analysis for evaluating the applicability and the significance of the illegitimate trade in other industries is still pending. The final limitation stems from the fact that it will be necessary to investigate the implications and the applicability of the model to the illegitimate on-line trade. Practical implications: During the course of the MI-FIDO project, the model and the selection rules identified for illegitimate trade family classification were used as a basis for defining the rules for anomalies detection to be included in a "track and trace" system developed the project team currently under with a major Italian fashion brand. Originality/value: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that attempts to present a concise and systematic approach to luxury illegitimate trade from a supply chain perspective. Understanding which legitimate-illegitimate supply chain interactions are the most damaging will help fashion luxury and other industries to battle the counterfeiting phenomenon more effectively © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In this study, a framework is proposed to achieve automatic defect detection and classification in color filter and micro-lens manufacturing to enhance the decision quality of pattern recognition. In particular, the proposed framework integrates Canny edge detection and classification and regression tree methodology. To validate the viability of the proposed framework in real settings, an empirical study was conducted in collaboration with a leading complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor foundry in Taiwan.

Comparing intensive and extensive shrimp farmer clusters in Ca Mau province, Vietnam, we explore how this form of cooperative production can enable small-holders to upgrade both functional and relational dimensions of production to meet new requirements for participation in the global shrimp value chain. The results show that by facilitating horizontal coordination between producers clusters can improve the management capacity of both intensive and extensive producers for meeting international production standards. However, the success of clusters also depends on the type and strength of vertical coordination with other actors along the value chain for both the provision of inputs and marketing of outputs. The paper concludes that for improved extensive shrimp farmer clusters to take further advantage of production-oriented quality standards the Vietnamese government needs to play a greater role in the development of production infrastructure and create a legal framework for private sector-led cluster formation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The proposed hybrid approach is able to organise supply chain units, transportation modes and work orders into different unit-transportation-work order families. It can determine the optimal clustering parameter, namely the number of clusters, c, and weighting exponent, m, dynamically, and is able to eliminate the necessity of pre-defining suitable values for these clustering parameters. A new fuzzy c-means validity index that takes into account inter-cluster transportation and group efficiency is formulated. It is employed to determine the promise level that estimates how good a set of clustering parameters is. The capability of the proposed hybrid approach is illustrated using three experiments and the comparative studies. The results show that the proposed hybrid approach is able to suggest suitable clustering parameters and near optimal supply chain clusters can be obtained readily. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This geography, at the heart of many sourcing strategies, is often neglected by supply chain managers, or at least scholars investigating supply chain management. However, this essay underlines that this geography reveals patterns that depict well the organization and structure of outsourcing with distribution systems supporting the dichotomy between the geography of production and consumption. Significant segments of supply chain management exist solely to support this spatial divergence. Global processes are also reflected in regional structures and the case of third party logistics providers is investigated. Depending on the gateway and the type of supply chain being serviced, North American 3PLs display a clustering that is particularly prevalent around airport terminals and crossborder ports of entry. Such firms are highly flexible and changes in the locational behavior are likely to reflect changes in outsourcing and supply chain management. © 2012 Institute for Supply Management, Inc.},

Flow time (FT), noted cycle time in semiconductor manufacturing, is a key measure in the operations. This study develops FT forecasting models using knowledge discovery in databases. It follows cross industry standards for data mining, with the focus on business understanding, data pre-processing and classification techniques. The data include wafer lot transactions extracted from the manufacturing execution system of an 8-inch flash memory factory. The FT is forecasted for a single lot at a given production step. The models are constructed using 70% of the data and the rest 30% for their evaluation. The results illustrate that a decision tree model achieves 76.7% accuracy and a neural network model 88.2%. The novelty of this work is in a thorough understanding of operations, a single data source, and common classification techniques used to obtain high accuracy results. The models can generate FT forecasting for a single production step, a line segment or a complete line. They can be used to improve short term planning, overall operations and supply chain efficiency, via shift scheduling, labour and materials requirements planning, inventory management and delivery schedules. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Most of the works focused on the detailed functionality of individuals in a small scale supply system while the network topology is often overlooked. Recently, network theory is introduced to study the structure-activity relations in supply networks. However, the understanding of connectivity pattern and collective behavior in large scale system is still limited. In our work, we propose a framework to model the supply network and analyze the relation between the clustering structure of the system and the dynamical logistic processes. In this framework, Configuration Models are used to build supply networks with different connectivity structures. Then by applying the logistic model on the networks, we could simulate the dynamical processes and evaluate the logistic performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the logistic dynamics of supply networks are highly related to the clustering structure. Using two measurements, we show that the supply networks with clustering structure can provide better services than those without by performing shorter Order lead-time and higher Delivery efficiency. © 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

At the second level is a supply chain synthesis carried out by P-graph based optimisation within each cluster. It provides a more detailed analysis. The use of the P-graph framework as a synthesis toolset provides a strong mathematically proven fundament for handling the complexity of the synthesis problem.

	abstract = {Preliminary studies have suggested that the Amish-based furniture and related products manufacturing cluster located in and around Holmes County, Ohio, uses sizeable quantities of hardwood lumber. The number of firms within the cluster has grown even as the broader domestic furniture manufacturing sector has contracted. The present study was undertaken in 2008 (spring/summer) to develop lumber use estimates specific to Amish manufacturing and provide more detail regarding the impacts of clustering on lumber consumption patterns. Results, based on 196 firms responding to a survey, suggested that lumber use ratios (bd ft per employee) differed among firms of different sizes and type of product manufactured, but in aggregate was similar to the broader US furniture industry. Red oak was the most commonly used species. Local suppliers of hardwood lumber and components were used extensively by most firms. The study confirmed that the Holmes County furniture cluster was important to regional hardwood demand, facilitated by well-developed supply chains that enable high specialization and enhance aggregate productivity among the numerous small manufacturers.},

There is a need for new methods and tools to visualize the supply chain topologies which captures and recognizes the complexity of the supply chain network. This paper presents a Knowledge-based Customization System for Supply Chain Integration (KCSSI) which is developed based on three core technologies: visualization of topologies, network analysis, and knowledge-based system so as to obtain quantified actionable information and formulating strategies for supply chain configuration leading the long term success. The performance of the system is verified by a series of controlled simulation experiments conducted in a selected reference site. It is verified that the KCSSI improves supply chain visibility by recognizing the structure clustering and interconnection of the supply chain network, quantifying and exploiting holistic supply chain performance to provide measurable insights for the customization of the supply chain configuration leading to long term success. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/ approach - In total, 98 automobile and auto-parts manufacturers are surveyed to identify service needs, preferences, and outsourcing commitments. By applying a two-stage clustering approach combined with Ward's minimum-variance method and the K-means algorithm, the logistics companies prioritize their services to better satisfy groups of customers with specific preferences. Findings - Four distinctive groups of manufacturers are identified using the two-stage clustering approach. The clusters separate logistic preferences and outsourcing patterns of after market parts suppliers, original equipment service parts suppliers, original equipment manufacturer parts suppliers, and tier one car makers. The paper finds that distribution and delivery services hold the highest percentage of services outsourced among the manufacturers. Originality/value - This paper models logistic services as customizable services and develops a data system methodology to define the profiles of automobile manufacturers and their preferred logistic services. Through the analysis of service preferences and clustering, the paper identifies the key logistic services that can be customized for members of the automobile supply chain. A case is provided which demonstrates how a logistics company can provide customized service designs for specific target markets and customers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

However, the current approaches do not create an organizational framework to deal with the full integration of the supply chains for component based construction. The real construction supply chain of clients, designers, specialist designers, specialist manufacturers, constructors and assemblers is not integrated into one group with a common purpose. A major and ongoing challenge is to manage the essential grouping of contributors and participants, many of whom are involved for varying times on a relatively short-term basis. Grouping, by using technology clusters, addresses many of these challenges as it creates a commonly shared sub-organization and culture that aids the removal of barriers to efficient and quality production. A technology cluster approach is a management philosophy and its principles can be applied whatever the procurement approach, although managed forms of procurement provide a better framework. Our studies of projects that have adopted a clustering approach have provided an understanding of the implementation issues of technology clusters and established the consequent changes in organizational design and management necessary to achieve full integration of the supply chain. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

In particular, the stakeholders in the content distribution market are considering exploiting content delivery networks (CDNs) to play a key enabling role allowing them to become part of related value chains. In this paper we discuss how such CDNs rely on autonomous algorithms to optimally use the storage resources, i.e., reducing bandwidth on feeder links, while providing quality of experience (QoE) to the end user. A model is presented to allow the comparison of algorithms that rely on measuring content popularity versus new recommender based algorithms that base caching decisions on predictions of individual end user behavior. The performance and the dynamics of these algorithmic components are assessed based on a theoretical demand model for a cache deployed at one of the various levels in a tree-based access network, inclusive of a single user cache. This scientific analysis allows to carefully pitch some considerations towards infrastructure network providers that deploy such storage networking. © 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.},

	abstract = {A two-level approach to biomass supply chain synthesis based on a novel Regional Energy Clustering (REC) approach has been proposed. There are two main parts of the regional resources management. The first consists of forming clusters of zones for biomass management. The second part builds a Regional Resources Management Composite Curve (RRMCC). Generating a biomass transfer network between the various zones in a given region is an optimisation task determining the links and the biomass flows from the available energy surplus zones to the deficit zones. This is followed by grouping the zones into clusters using the combination of links and the overall energy imbalance as an objective function to be minimised. The information about the clusters is further plotted in the RRMCC with the cumulative land use on the y-axis and cumulative energy surplus-deficit as x-axis. This graphical representation shows the magnitude of the imbalance within each cluster and provides a tool for analysing the trade-off between land use and biomass generation, thus aiding regional planners in analysing the optimal land use on the one hand and the regional energy management surpluses and deficits on the other.

The study represents the addressed location-allocation problem by bi-level stochastic programming and develops a genetic algorithm with efficient greedy heuristics to solve the problem. The contribution of the study pivots on a formal representation of system configuration design and operations optimization for a two-echelon supply chain. The proposed solution algorithm can find near optimal solution while consuming less computational time for large-size problems as compared to an optimization-based tool. In addition, this study investigates the industrial-cluster effect in a two-echelon supply chain by using the proposed algorithm.

In order to better manage the processes impacting this performance metric, providers can leverage data resources describing the network of activities that impact a patient's stay with analytic methods. Interdependencies between departmental activities exist within the patient treatment process, where inefficiency in one element of the patient care network of activities can adversely affect process outcomes.This work utilizes the method of neural networks to analyze data describing inpatient cases that incorporate radiology process variables to determine their effect on patient length of stay excesses for a major NJ based healthcare provider. The results indicate that inefficiencies at the radiology level can adversely extend a patient's length of stay beyond initial estimations. Proactive analysis of networks of activities in the patient treatment process can enhance organizational efficiencies of healthcare providers by enabling decision makers to better optimize resource allocations to increase throughput of activities. © The Author(s) 2010.},

	abstract = {The household product industry often suffers from problems of high operational costs and/or lost sales from selling seasonal products since managers in different divisions/stages of the supply chain make their decisions independently. We are therefore motivated to propose an approach that integrates the operations in the three stages of a supply chain for the management of seasonal products. The goal of this study is to minimize the total costs incurred for the seasonal products in the whole selling period. In the first stage, we employ a newsvendor model to determine the optimal one-time-only order quantities of the seasonal products. Then, we utilize a clustering analysis in the second stage to categorize seasonal products into groups, and establish an optimal replenishment policy for the products in the same group. Finally, the third stage starts when the warehouse runs out of its inventory. We formulate a mathematical model to determine the optimal transshipment quantities among all of the retailers to minimize the expected total costs incurred for the rest of the selling period. Taking a household product company in Taiwan as our case study, we demonstrate the implementation of the proposed (integrated) approach. Based on the real-world data of 17 seasonal products, we show that our integrated approach significantly outperforms the company's current ap-proach. Therefore, our integrated approach may serve as an effective decision support tool for the distribution and lateral transshipment of seasonal products in the household product industry.},

	abstract = {To examine management options for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, eight research regions were classified into social-ecological domains, using a dataset of indicators of livelihood resources, i.e., capital assets. Potential interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture were then compared among landscapes and domains. The approach combined literature review with expert judgment by researchers working in each landscape. Each landscape was described for land use, rural livelihoods and attitudes of social actors toward biodiversity and intensification of agriculture. Principal components analysis of 40 indicators of natural, human, social, financial and physical capital for the eight landscapes showed a loss of biodiversity associated with high-input agricultural intensification. High levels of natural capital (e.g. indicators of wildland biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity for human needs) were positively associated with indicators of human capital, including knowledge of the flora and fauna and knowledge sharing among farmers. Three social-ecological domains were identified across the eight landscapes (Tropical Agriculture-Forest Matrix, Tropical Degrading Agroecosystem, and Temperate High-Input Commodity Agriculture) using hierarchical clustering of the indicator values. Each domain shared a set of interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture and ecological intensification that could also increase food security in the impoverished landscapes. Implementation of interventions differed greatly among the landscapes, e.g. financial capital for new farming practices in the Intensive Agriculture domain vs. developing market value chains in the other domains. This exploratory study suggests that indicators of knowledge systems should receive greater emphasis in the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and that inventories of assets at the landscape level can inform adaptive management of agrobiodiversity-based interventions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this study we examine the relationship between supply network's topology and its robustness in the presence of random failures and targeted attacks. The agent-based model developed in this paper uses the basic framework and parameters in the experimental game presented in Sterman [1989, Modeling managerial behavior: Misperceptions of feedback in a dynamic decision making context. Management Science, 35 (3), 321-339] for modelling adaptive managerial decision making in an inventory management context. The study extends the linear supply chain context to a complex supply network and undertakes a rigorous examination of robustness of these supply networks that are characterised by distinct network characteristics. We theorise that network characteristics such as average path length, clustering coefficient, size of the largest connected component in the network and the maximum distance between nodes in the largest connected component are related to the robustness of supply networks, and test the research hypotheses using data from several simulation runs. Simulations were carried out using 20 distinct network topologies where 10 of these topologies were generated using preferential attachment approach (based on the theory of scale-free networks) and the remaining 10 topologies were generated using random attachment approach (using random graph theory as a foundation). These 20 supply networks were subjected to random demand and their performances were evaluated by considering varying probabilities of random failures of nodes and targeted attacks on nodes. We also consider the severity of these disruptions by considering the downtime of the affected nodes. Using the data collected from a series of simulation experiments, we test the research hypotheses by means of binomial logistic regression analysis. The results point towards a significant association between network characteristics and supply network robustness assessed using multiple performance measures. We discuss the implications of the study and present directions for future research. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

Design/methodology/approach Value network analysis was first developed in 1993 and was adapted in 1997 for intangible asset management. It has been tested in applications from shop floor work groups to business webs and economic regions. It draws from a theory based in living systems, knowledge management, complexity theory, system dynamics, and intangible asset management. Findings The paper provides a high level of detail on the analysis method and insights from its practical application across a range of business issues. Tips are provided for how to integrate the methodology with other business analysis approaches. Research limitations/implications The paper does not provide a comparative analysis with other methods because most other value network models are process views, social network analysis or clustering techniques. Practical implications Sufficient detail is provided so researchers and practitioners will be able to apply the method in their own investigations. Further resources are noted, as well as access points to the global user community and open source tools. Originality/value This paper is the first detailed publication of the value network analysis method, which has been acclaimed by experts in intangibles, network analysis, knowledge management, and process analysis.

	abstract = {A chain risk model (CRM) has been developed to calculate the cost-effectiveness of phytosanitary measures. The CRM is a quantitative model for phytosanitary assessments of all kinds of agricultural product chains. In the CRM, chain stages are connected by the product volume streams at which infections of pests can be spread from one stage to another. The arrangement of the stages in the chain can be varied by the model's user. Primary infection of a pest in the chain stages can take place by imported commodities, from a former chain stage and from outside. Spread of pests is simulated by a spread factor and the multiplying factor of the product itself, estimated by the model user. The costs of measurements assessed and their effect on the pest or detection of the pest have to be entered in the model. The result of the model calculations is the cost effectiveness of a measurement or set of measurements. An additional result is an overview of the distribution of infected lots in the chain. Experience with the CRM has been gained by applying it to two actual problems: Clavibacter michicanensis subsp. michicanensis, which causes bacterial wilt and canker of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) and Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), which is also called tomato bunchy top virus. Both cases confirm the hypothesis that CRM is applicable for the assessment of various sets of measurements, like checks in different chain stages and application of a quality care system in some stages. The CRM is primarily intended for use by the Dutch Plant Protection Service (nVWA) but can also be used by other national plant protection organizations. The generic and flexible model can be used for calculations on topics as assessment of new detection techniques, assessment of risk reduction measurements on pathways and assessment of different alternatives of sampling in relation to different kinds of phytosanitary checks. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Several studies were conducted during recent years on exploring the impact of Information Technology (IT) on the performance of the organisation. It is quite important to find a robust technique to identify the relationship between IT and organisational performance. A hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) approach is proposed for data clustering. This is because of the need for the application of metaheurisitic algorithms parallel to deterministic approaches. This study discusses and analyses data from 90 companies in a unique supply chain. The data includes 26 indices about IT and 11 indices about performance. The companies are classified with respect to the IT and performance indices (indicators). Then, IT clusters and performance clusters are mapped to one another and, consequently, the relationship between them is explored. In general, the result shows that there is a linear relationship between the IT status and performance of the companies, with few exceptions. This is the first study which integrates ant colony approach and GA for exploring the relationship between IT and firm performance. Copyright © 2009, Inderscience Publishers.},

In this contract, the vendor usually incurs a penalty cost for items exceeding these bounds. The purpose of this paper is to develop a model for a supply chain with single vendor and multiple retailers under VMI mode of operation. This model explicitly includes the VMI contractual agreement between the vendor and retailers. The developed model can easily describe supply chains with capacity constraints by selecting high penalty cost. Theorems are established to alleviate the complexity of the model and render the mathematics tractable. Moreover, an efficient algorithm is devised to find the global optimal solution. This algorithm reduces the computational efforts significantly. In addition, numerical experiments are conducted to show the utility of the proposed model. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The technological complexity of modern production facilities and the increasing demands on operation procedures result in new tasks and requirements for automation solutions and operating staff qualification. On the one hand, supervision and control systems must assign tasks which have been carried out by operators - e.g. operative planning of resources, scheduling of maintenance, operation tuning. On the other hand, the operating principles and techniques must become more objective; operating experience and knowledge should be more easily collected, conserved and disseminated. The general objective of this paper is to develop methods and techniques for these issues. The studied approach is based on integrated use of several formalizations of facility operation knowledge - mathematical modelling, data-driven methods, and scenario-oriented supervision and control routines. Here, facility events in the past are classified by means of Data Mining. Cause-and-effect relations between process states and phenomena are expressed by equations. Facility operation routines are modelled in the form of 'if-then' scenarios. The functional chain, which begins with operator knowledge acquisition and moves to knowledge and facility modelling and finally to their integration into a real Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system, have been implemented and tested for a water treatment and supply plant.},

In this paper, we considered a supply-chain (SC) system including several kinds of products. Using historic suppliers' demand data, we firstly applied the phase space analysis method and then used qualitative analysis to improve the complex system's performance. Quantitative methods can forecast the quantitative SC demands, but they cannot indicate the qualitative aspects of SC, so when we apply quantitative methods to a SC system we get only numerous data of demand. By contrast, qualitative methods can show the qualitative change and trend of the SC demand. We therefore used qualitative methods to improve the quantitative forecasting results. Comparing the quantitative only method and the combined method used in this paper, we found that the combined method is far more accurate. Not only is the inventory cost lower, but the forecasting accuracy is also better. © 2010. The Authors.},

From questionnaire surveys on 209 food SMEs of fruit/vegetable, seafood, meat and cereal production, the awareness level was classified by K-means clustering analysis. There were 'High awareness' and 'Low awareness' group. Such two groups had differences in profile of education, business operation model, enterprises's size and income. Companies based on their product types had no impact on the awareness level. One interesting observation from the awareness assessing, the high awareness group still had unclear understanding on food poisoning from microbiological contamination. For capacity building requests, the high awareness group acquired the knowledge more in marketing oriented, while the low awareness group still needed training on the quality and safety management for food production.

	abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to develop a qualitative risk model to empirically identify the important outsourcing risks of logistical functions using the data of Taiwanese retail chains. Design/methodology/approach - Transaction cost theory (TCT) and resourced based view (RBV) were combined to develop risk events. Analytical hierarchy process was used for risk calibration. Valid data from 75 outsourcer chains and 41 in-house chains were collected through a three-stage survey. Outsourcers were further clustered by risk perception using Wards' and K-mean clustering and examined by an ANOVA. Results of outsourcers and in-house chains were compared using nonparametric Spearman rank correlation test. Findings - The risk perception increases as the number of functions outsourced increases. Risks related to transaction costs and strategic resources were both significant. Of the three main risks identified, asset risk and competence risk are more serious concerns than relationship risk. The values of information risk and loss of control account for the bulk of asset risk, while those of poor competence leverage and poor competence in supporting customer service comprise competence risk. Finally, in terms of risk priority, in-house chains showed no significant difference from outsourcers. Research limitation/implication - Interrelationships between risk events were limited to avoid complication. Also, due to the sample limit, the risks calibrated may be more associated with outsourcing execution than outsourcing building/abandoning. Practical implication - The risk structure developed herein can be used as a systematic checklist for outsourcing decision-making. The qualitative results may provide specific indications for further risk analysis and future risk control. Originality/value - The study fills a gap in the literature, where prior work has seldom used empirical research to compare how well TCT and the RBV predict logistics outsourcing risk, in particular for the distribution side of the supply chain. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Consequently, a more suitable approach is desired.

This, blood reserve availability assessment, tracking, and management system (BRAMS), research project has been funded by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. (This DoD funded SBIR project is performed by the researchers at Knowledge Based Systems, Inc. (KBSI).) The rapidly increasing demand, criticality of the product, strict storage and handling requirements, and the vastness of the theater of operations, make blood supply-chain management a complex, yet vital problem for the department of defense. In order to address this problem a variety of contemporary analytic techniques are used to analyze inventory and consumption patterns, evaluate supply chain status, monitor performance metrics at different levels of granularity, and detect potential problems and opportunities for improvement. The current implementation of the system is being actively used by 130 mangers at different levels in the supply chain including facilities at Osan Air Force Base in South Korea and Incirlik Air Force Base in Turkey. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Design/methodology/approach–The research makes an attempt to capture the knowledge of segmenting the customers based on various attributes as an input to the demand forecasting in a retail store. The paper suggests a data mining model which has been used for forecasting of demand. The proposed model has been applied for forecasting demands of eight SKUs for grocery items in a supermarket. Based on the proposed forecasting model, the inventory performance has been studied with simulation. Findings–The proposed forecasting model with the inventory replenishment system results in the reduction of inventory level and increase in customer service level. Hence, the proposed model in the paper results in improved performance of inventory. Practical implicationsRetailers can make use of the proposed model for demand forecasting of various items to improve the inventory performance and profitability of operations. Originality/value–With the advent of data mining systems which have given rise to the use of business intelligence in various domains, the current paper addresses one of the most pressing issues in retail management, as demand forecasting with minimum error is the key to success in inventory and supply chain management. The proposed forecasting model with the inventory replenishment system results in the reduction of inventory level and increase in customer service level. The proposed model outperforms other widely used existing models. © 2012, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

To reduce losses, one wants to be informed about such deviations as soon as possible, preferably even before they occur. Then it is possible to take actions to prevent or reduce negative consequences. In practice, extensive operational data is recorded, forming a valuable source for early warning and proactive control systems, i.e. decision support systems for prediction and prevention of such performance problems. Data mining methods are ideal for analyzing such data sources and extracting useable information from them. In this paper, we present a novel framework for early warning and proactive control systems that combine expert knowledge and data mining methods to exploit recorded data.

It does this by reviewing two strands of literature. In the first, it reviews the literature related to ICT micro-enterprises, focussing particularly on two sub-sectors that might be considered successful, mobile entrepreneurship and the Nigerian video-film industry. It draws out three key themes that are addressed in the literature – the significance of local networks and supply chains; strategies of niches and appropriation; and the importance of context. This analysis also reveals a significant weakness in the literature. Studies have generally made a close focus on the local practices and technology actions of such micro-enterprises, but there has been little analysis of such micro-enterprise within wider conceptual frameworks, which means that there are significant gaps relating to understanding of the developmental role and potential of such ICT micro-enterprise. Thus, the broader development literature is reviewed related to the three key themes that were identified. This wider literature highlights three conceptual literatures – enterprise clustering and upgrading, base-of-the-pyramid markets, and urban development – that are able to offer some useful lenses for researching ICT micro-enterprise, as well as highlighting potential future research directions. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons.},

The problem is modelled as a employee routing problem (ERP), i.e., each bus has a limited number of seats and the number of employees picked up by each bus should be less than or equal to the maximum capacity of the bus. The techniques used here are Fuzzy C-mean clustering and 0-1 integer programming model for obtaining the allocation of employees to each bus. The other techniques include nearest neighbourhood, which is used to obtain the initial route for the buses and 2-opt method, which is used to improve the travelling route by reducing the total cost and thus it helps in achieving the objective of ERP.

The problem consists in developing a distribution plan to replenish inventory at each of the involved sales-points, and then clustering them in groups willing to cooperate and share parts of their stocks. The distribution strategy and clustering should be achieved in a way that minimises total distribution and inventory costs of the system. Clearly, cooperation inside each cluster increases the extra potential inventory to which each member of the cluster has access, without having to support the related cost. As a result, the service level that each of these sales-point may achieve would increase. This approach is implemented for a real-life supply chain.

This paper deals with the application of spectral clustering to achieve this aim. A semi-supervised approach can take into account the graph structure of a network and incorporate the corresponding hydraulic constraints and the other available vector information from the WSN. Several of the disadvantages of these methodologies stem from the largeness of the most WSN and the associated computational complexity. To solve these problems, we propose subsampling graph data to run successive weak clusters and build a single robust cluster configuration. The resulting methodology has been tested in a real network and can be used to successfully partition large WSNs. © 2012 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Marketing strategies for successful non-wood forest product (NWFP) commercialization are important especially in those rural economies where NWFPs represent a considerable source of income for small and medium-scale forest-based enterprises. Two different organisational models in mushrooms marketing-a 'traditional approach' and a 'net-system approach'-are compared through a case-study research approach. The first model is usually based on single large-scale enterprises producing large quantities of standardized, mass-market oriented products; its main commercial goal is the improvement of the value-chain from producer to end-users, with no special links or integration between the production area and the producers. The second, quite new approach is based on several integrated small and medium-scale rural-based enterprises supplying relatively limited quantities of high quality products, oriented to niche markets. In this case, product specialty identification, complementary actions, integration, and clustering among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) within the same production area are the most important goals. In the case studies, both organisational models have proved to be feasible and working with respect to the respective goals. Traditional large-scale enterprises, based on vertical integration and a short value chain, can achieve substantial economic performance; however, these are unlikely to have a significant positive impact on the socio-economic local context and are threatened by high business risk (mainly due to its strong specialization on a 'climate-dependent' NWFP). The analysed forest-based business model founded on networking, which involves not only forest-based SMEs but also other institutional, economic, and social actors, has proved to be not only economically viable and less risky with respect to the traditional model, but also more equitable in distribution of benefits, and effective in stimulating the local economy as a whole, integrated system based on NWFPs and related environmental services. © 2009 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Based on prior studies, the performance of customer relationships depends highly on the characteristics of the e-service. However, the strength of this association can be impacted when businesses employ multichannel services (e.g. offering online and offline services). With multichannel services, any inconsistency in perceived quality across channels may result in customer distrust toward a service provider. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of inconsistent quality on the association between e-service quality and customer relationships in a university context. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted a web survey and 318 respondents who have both physical and e-service experiences were collected. The inconsistent quality across channels was divided into three groups by k-means clustering approach. Next, the hypothesized associations were analyzed using regression analysis based on three groups. Findings: The results show that inconsistent quality has different impacts on the association between e-service quality and customer relationships across the three groups. Especially in the positive disconfirmation group, the investment in e-services will be in vain because certain e-service sub-constructs lose their impact on customer relationships. Practical implications: The findings of this study provide implications for improving customer relationships under different cross-channel quality inconsistency conditions for managers. Originality/value: This study extends the concept of expectancy disconfirmation theory to the multichannel service context and pioneers the exploration of the moderating effect of cross-channel quality inconsistency in customer relationships, contributing to the understanding of the literature about the impacts of inconsistent quality on customer relationships. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The exploitation of the energy potential in biomass in a specific geographical region is frequently constrained by high production costs and the amount of land required per unit of energy generated. In addition, the distributed nature of the biomass resource and its normally low energy density may result in large transportation costs. Biomass also requires large land areas to collect and process the incoming solar radiation before the energy can be harvested. Previously published works on regional energy clustering (REC) and the Regional Resources Management Composite Curve, RRMCC (in this paper shortened to RMC), have been extended in this paper to tackle simultaneously the issues of the biomass supply chain, transportation, and land use. The RMC is a tool for supporting decision making in regional resource management. It provides a complete view of energy and land availability in a region, displaying their trade-offs in a single plot. The extension presented in this work has been developed in two steps. The first step presents the Regional Energy Cascade Analysis, which estimates the energy target within regional supply chains and provides the result for energy exchange flows between zones, the quantity of energy required to be imported/exported, and the locations of the demands. In the second step, the initial results are analysed against potential measures for improving the energy and land use targets by using the RMC and a set of rules for its manipulation. The presented method provides the option to assess the priorities: either to produce and sell the surplus energy on the fuel market or use the land for other purposes such as food production. This extended approach is illustrated with a comprehensive case study demonstrating that with the RMC application it is possible to maximise the land use and to maximise the biofuel production for the requested energy demand. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The Trading Agent Competition Supply Chain Management (TAC SCM) game allows for a huge strategy space, including time limitations and frequent transactions along with a competitive, dynamic, and stochastic environment that inhibits long-term policies, analytical studies, and the application of mathematical optimization techniques. Within the TAC SCM game,5 agents act as personal computer (PC) manufacturers, competing with each other for supplier and customer contracts. In the TAC SCM auction environment, as well as in real life situations, it's common for the agent to employ a probability distribution function that predicts the probability of an offer becoming an order, given the bidding price. TAC SCM is even more challenging because agents must decide on a subset of daily requests for quotes (RFQs) to bid on.},

	abstract = {Supplier base management is an important strategy for managing global, customer driven supply chains. Successful supplier base management can effectively handle supply side exceptions, which may have significant business implications. Currently, there is a trend to reduce the size of the supplier base which makes the coordination and interaction among suppliers more effective, less costly and time consuming. The goal of this research is to present a clustering algorithm, named min-min-roughness (MMR) to cluster suppliers into smaller, more manageable groups with similar characteristics. Due to the fact that supplier data are mainly categorical in nature, MMR, based on rough set theory (RST) is developed for categorical data clustering which is also capable of handling the uncertainty during the clustering process. One potential benefit of applying MMR to supplier base management is that more realistic benchmarking can be obtained and the fulfilment operation can be sped up by reducing the number of variables impacting the operations. In addition, the characteristics of each smaller group of suppliers can be summarised and exploited to handle supply side disruptions. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {The main idea of this research is to devise the smart module to pick the best supplier bid(s) automatically. The hybrid model is composed of three useful tools: fuzzy logic, AHP, and QFD. The approach has been carefully implemented and verified via a real-world case study in a medium-to-large industry manufacturing vehicle tires and other rubber products. A collection of 12 assessment criteria classified into two categories have been considered. Eight factors are derived from customer suggestions and the other four are design specifications required to manufacture the product. The main outcomes are: a hybrid autonomous model to evaluate supplier bids without direct human intervention; devising a hybrid three-module method and overcoming complexity of computations in resulting algorithm by means of agents; outlining the best criteria to assess suppliers; evaluating the suppliers based on voice of customer during all stages of the process; and discussing analysis, design, and implementation issues of the evaluation agent. The paper includes implications for development of an integrated total system for supply chain coordination. The most important advantages of this work over earlier researches on supplier selection are: implementation of an autonomous assessment mechanism using intelligent agents for the first time, making the best out of three widely applied methodologies all at once, evaluation process mainly based on features of customer order, coordination of supply job based on a bidding system, and portal-mediated operation and control. © 2011 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

The Argentine biofuels sector exhibits clustering at both the cultivation and processing levels, but is also strongly dependent on other relationships both nationally and internationally, including research and development linkages with international biotechnology firms and the more economically significant soy oil and meal markets. Although the trend of horizontal and vertical integration is advanced and likely to continue, we argue that clustering, in the sense of geographic proximity, needs to be seen in the context of the value chain. To date, governance of the soy industry has been characterised by declining government intervention in production, processing and export processes. In the absence of strong policy, it has been left to agroindustry to determine the development of the nascent biofuels sector, towards one focused primarily on the export market and leading to substantial gains for some actors in the value chain and losses for weaker players. © Tomei and Upham.},

	abstract = {For decades, computer scientists have tried to teach computers to think like human experts. Until recently, most of those efforts have failed to come close to generating the creative insights and solutions that seem to come naturally to the best researchers, doctors, and engineers. But now, Tony Hey, a VP of Microsoft Research, says we're witnessing the dawn of a new generation of powerful computer tools that can "mash up" vast quantities of data from many sources, analyze them, and help produce revolutionary scientific discoveries. Hey and his colleagues call this new method of scientific exploration "machine learning." At Microsoft, a team has already used it to innovate a method of predicting with impressive accuracy whether a patient with congestive heart failure who is released from the hospital will be readmitted within 30 days. It was developed by directing a computer program to pore through hundreds of thousands of data points on 300,000 patients and "learn" the profiles of patients most likely to be rehospitalized. The economic impact of this prediction tool could be huge: If a hospital understands the likelihood that a patient will "bounce back," it can design programs to keep him stable and save thousands of dollars in health care costs. Similar efforts to uncover important correlations that could lead to scientific breakthroughs are under way in oceanography, conservation, and AIDS research. And in business, deep data exploration has the potential to unearth critical insights about customers, supply chains, advertising effectiveness, and more.},

	abstract = {Automated negotiation systems with software agents representing individuals or organizations and capable of reaching agreements through negotiation are becoming increasingly important and pervasive. Examples, to mention a few, include the industrial trend toward agent-based supply chain management, the business trend toward virtual enterprises, and the pivotal role that electronic commerce is increasingly assuming in many organizations. Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have paid a great deal of attention to automated negotiation over the past decade and a number of prominent models have been proposed in the literature. These models exhibit fairly different features, make use of a diverse range of concepts, and show performance characteristics that vary significantly depending on the negotiation context. As a consequence, assessing and relating individual research contributions is a difficult task. Currently, there is a need to build a framework to define and characterize the essential features that are necessary to conduct automated negotiation and to compare the usage of key concepts in different publications. Furthermore, the development of such a framework can be an important step to identify the core elements of autonomous negotiating agents, to provide a coherent set of concepts related to automated negotiation, to assess progress in the field, and to highlight new research directions. Accordingly, this paper introduces a generic framework for automated negotiation. It describes, in detail, the components of the framework, assesses the sophistication of the majority of work in the AI literature on these components, and discusses a number of prominent models of negotiation. This paper also highlights some of the major challenges for future automated negotiation research. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Several technologies have emerged for the management of agile supply chains. But most of them are in development stages. No common method exists for evaluating agility in supply chains by both researchers and practitioners. The complex manufacturing systems necessitate the validation of innovative solutions using advanced managerial tools and techniques. The manufacturing paradigms have to be evaluated according to their short term action and long term benefits. This article reports the utilisation of fuzzy association rules mining (FARM) approach which enables the decision makers to make flexible decisions for evaluating agility in supply chains in the presence of attributes such as flexibility, profitability, quality, innovativeness, pro-activity, speed of response, cost and robustness. The approach has been applied in an Indian electronic switches manufacturing organisation. The experiences of the conduct of this research indicate that agility evaluation can be performed without constraints by the decision makers. The case study is being demonstrated in which agility of supply chains is evaluated by determining association rules from the database. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

Industry clustering is a useful concept for understanding the interdependence among industries and its implications for regional economic development and growth. The paper claims that the fullest understanding of the implications of industrial interdependence for rural economies requires viewing linked industries - or value chains - on a spatial continuum, from those that are national in geographic scope to those that are highly localized in specific places as regional clusters. From that perspective, rural economies may depend on - as well as contribute to - the competitive success of value chains anchored elsewhere. The perspective is operationalized using a new classification of 45 US industry value chains together with a new rural-urban county typology. The results demonstrate that rural America plays an integral part in a great variety of US value chains. Federal, state, or local development agencies must be careful not to view rural cluster strategy strictly as the development of groups of linked and related industries concentrated in specific rural places, as there are real opportunities to identify and leverage the advantages of rural locations for businesses and industries in globally competitive and geographically extensive value chains.},

	abstract = {Logistics network design is one of the most important phases in supply chain management (SCM). Transportation planning (TP) is a well-known basic network model that can be generally defined as a problem to minimize the total delivery cost. But for some real-world applications, the TP model is often extended to satisfy other additional constraints or is performed in several stages. In addition, the concept of inventory is not included in a traditional TP model. Moreover, time concepts, such as carrying costs in a certain period, are not treated. Even if it is a plant that belongs to the same company, delivery methods may be different for each product. These restrictions on this model profoundly affect the use of the TP model in the real world. In this paper, we formulate a two-stage transportation problem with inventory and exclusionary side constraints. In this model, 1 year is divided into several terms and the annual demands of delivery centers are satisfied for each term. This model includes the additional constraint in which simultaneous shipments between some plants are prohibited. To solve the problem, we propose an effective genetic algorithm (GA) method called the Boltzmann random key-based GA (Brk-GA). One characteristic of this method is that it features new selection processing through Boltzmann scaling and the local search techniques. © 2010 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

In fact, retailing is actually the last step in a supply chain that may stretch from Europe or Asia to the customer's hometown. Therefore, any firm that sells a product or provides a service to the final consumer is performing the retailing function. On the other hand, product line extension, which adds depth to an existing product line by introducing new products in the same product category, can give customers greater choice and help to protect the firm from flanking attack by a competitor. In addition, a product line extension is marketed under the same general brand as a previous item or items. Thus, to distinguish the brand extension from the other item(s) under the primary brand, the retailer can either add secondary brand identification or add a generic brand. This paper investigates product line and brand extension issues in the Taiwan branch of a leading international retailing company, Carrefour, which is a hypermarket retailer. This paper develops a relational database and proposes Apriori algorithm and K-means as methodologies for association rule and cluster analysis for data mining, which is then implemented to mine customer knowledge from household customers.

We study the determinants of this firm-level choice. We present a simple conceptual framework to derive predictions that we subsequently test in the empirical analysis. We argue that an increment in buyers' spatial concentration benefits production in advance more in homogenous industries than in differentiated ones, while the benefits for production to order are larger as product differentiation increases. Consequently, the propensity to adopt one of the two production modes, following an increase in the number of local downstream buyers, changes according to the degree of product differentiation of the goods. Relying on a large data set of Italian manufacturing firms, we find empirical support to our ideas. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Such a fast move in industry has sometimes proven in the past to potentially lead to underestimating safety management needs. The significant number of existing facilities producing so called first generation biofuel allows for a reasonable survey of safety issues from incidents. In 2006, INERIS initiated research work devoted to the analysis of safety-related issues including the implementation of an incidents database. Its purpose is to collect known and reasonably well documented incidents (explosions, fires, spills, derailments, and road accidents) that relate to the life cycle of biofuel supply chains. This paper focuses on the analysis of this database, which contains 100 incidents that occurred from January 2000 to early 2009. From the database, an attempt has been made to identify the root factors of incidents potentially impacting biofuel supply chains, using statistical methods like multiple correspondence analysis and ascendant hierarchical clustering. This multivariate analysis exercise has led us to identify five main incident typologies, which in turn allows us to draw appropriate information on safety issues pertaining to first-generation biofuel supply chains. Each typology is illustrated by actual cases of accidents. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this paper we address flexibility and investigate the relationship between volume and product mix flexibility. One view of flexibility is that of being a capability in itself; another view is that of flexibility as an enabler, providing the manufacturing system with properties on which other competitive capabilities are built. In this research, the latter view of flexibility is used, where flexibility acts as a second order competitive criterion. The aim is to differentiate between two dimensions of flexibility important to the manufacturing value chain, i.e., volume and product mix flexibility, and to investigate how different flexibility configurations are related to various manufacturing practices. A clustering research approach is used to identify groups of companies based on flexibility configurations. The groups are then analyzed with respect to characteristics and impact on operational performance. For the empirical investigation, we use empirical data from the high performance manufacturing (HPM) study, including three industries and seven countries-a total of 211 plants. We find that flexibility configurations based on high or low levels of volume and mix flexibility combinations show significant differences both in terms of operational performance, and in terms of emphasis put into different flexibility source factors. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

One major limitation of the existing solution methods for MOO is that their computational burden tends to grow rapidly in size with the number of environmental objectives. In this paper, we study the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify redundant environmental metrics in MOO that can be omitted without disturbing the main features of the problem, thereby reducing the associated complexity. We show that, besides its numerical usefulness, the use of PCA coupled with MOO provides valuable insights on the relationships between environmental indicators of concern for decision-makers.

	abstract = {Purpose - In the light of lessons learned from recent disasters (The London subway bombings, and Hurricane Katrina), it has become increasingly clear that supply chain partners as well as government agencies need to be prepared to communicate effectively to consumers and customers before, during and after a disaster. Effective communication can minimize confusion and harm to company reputations, to consumers, the economy and the nation. Incorporating consistent communications into supply chain management (SCM) plans used by all parties in the supply chain will enhance competitiveness of the whole chain and speed recovery from potentially disastrous events. Findings from a national survey of consumer's attitudes about terrorism provide information about the development of targeted and effective communications. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a survey of more than 4,000 US consumers, this study used "predictive segmentation" which consists of a canonical factor analysis relating general consumer attitudes and values to their more specific fears and concerns about terrorism. A clustering of consumers then identifies six diverse consumer segments providing a framework for the development of communication strategies. Findings - Results from this study demonstrate that people can be grouped based on their general attitudes and values in such a way that their diversity can be captured in a simple framework of segments each reflecting striking differences in the level of concern over potential terrorist attacks. Practical implications - Guidance is offered for the development of communication strategies based on the information needs and media behavior of each consumer segment to mitigate the impact of a potential terrorist attack or catastrophic food safety breaches.It provides practical and logical extension of former studies that suggest incorporating consumers, attitudes into SCM and business continuity plans. Originality/value - This study leverages a common and proven marketing research approach - segmentation - used in private industry for the marketing of goods and service. It applies this method to defining segments of consumers based on their attitudes and concerns about terrorism that will be useful in supply chain communication management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This research classifies 370 state policies from across the United States that provides incentives for forest biomass utilization. We compare those policies by types of incentives relative to the supply chain and geographic clustering.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on analysis of the literature this paper builds on theoretical understandings of knowledge management, clustering and regional development. Findings - The concept of CoEs is most appropriate for regional areas characterised by many small enterprises in diverse industries. CoEs enhance development of regional clusters by contributing to their intellectual capital, innovation culture, value networks and social capital. The incorporation of information and communication technologies (ICT) creates VCoEs which provide added potential by enabling regions to expand their learning potential through innovation. Research limitations/implications - This paper provides a conceptual foundation for empirical research into regional network or cluster development using ICT. Practical implications - VCoEs value creation potential is substantial but only when the socioeconomic elements of regional clusters are understood. The VCoE approach addresses the fact that without an industry focus it can be difficult to engage and link small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from different industries, although this is where the greatest potential for value creation in regional clusters is to be found. Originality/value - The VCoEs concept specifically addresses the unique requirements of SMEs in regions. It has the potential to provide value for regions in a way few ICT based regional development initiatives have been able to achieve. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

While there are widely accepted benchmarks for individual warehouse functions such as order picking, little is known about the overall technical efficiency of warehouses. Lacking a general understanding of warehouse technical efficiency and the associated causal factors limits industry's ability to identify the best opportunities for improving warehouse performance. The problem is compounded by the significant gap in the education and training of the industry's professionals. This article addresses this gap by describing both a new methodology for assessing warehouse technical efficiency based on empirical data integrating several statistical approaches and the new results derived from applying the method to a large sample of warehouses. The self-reported nature of attributes and performance data makes the use of statistical methods for rectifying data, validating models, and identifying key factors affecting efficient performance particularly appropriate. This article also identifies several opportunities for additional research on warehouse assessment and optimization. [Supplementary materials are available for this article.

	abstract = {Besides its effectiveness, supply chain management (SCM) is a complex process because of the stochastic and dynamic nature, multi-criterion and ever-increasing complexity of supply chains. Furthermore, companies have realized that agility is essential for their survival and competitiveness. Consequently, there is no generally accepted method by researchers and practitioners for designing, operating and evaluating agile supply chains. Moreover, the ability to build agile supply chain has developed more slowly than anticipated, because technology for managing agile supply chain is still being developed. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a new approach based on Fuzzy Association Rule Mining to support the decision makers by enhancing the flexibility in making decisions for evaluating agility with both tangibles and intangibles attributes/criteria such as Flexibility, Profitability, Quality, Innovativeness, Pro-activity, Speed of response, Cost and Robustness. Also, by checking the fuzzy classification rules, the goal of knowledge acquisition can be achieved in a framework in which evaluation of agility could be established without constraints, and consequently checked and compared in several details. Efficacy and intricacy of the proposed approach for finding fuzzy association rules from the database for evaluating agility is demonstrated with the help of a numerical example. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Petroleum is an important strategic material which is connected with the vitals and safety of the national economy, and the supplier selections are related to the safety of petroleum production and supply. However, the traditional approaches for supplier selections are limited in subjective evaluation of weights, inaccurate assessing rules, and inefficient decision-making. Although most of the current methods are widely applied in corporation management, a more efficient approach needs to be proposed for supplier selection of oil enterprise. This paper summarizes the particular characteristics of the supply chain of Chinese petroleum enterprises, analyzes the limitations of the traditional methods of supplier selection, and brought forward the method based on case reasoning system (CBR) for petroleum enterprises. The method based on data mining techniques which solves three key problems of CBR, includes calculating the weights of the attributes with information entropy in case warehouse organizing process objectively, evaluating the similarities with k-prototype clustering between the original and target cases in case retrieving process exactly, and extracting the potential rules with back propagation neural networks from conclusions in maintenance and revising process efficiently. It demonstrates the advantages, practicability and validity of this method via case study finally. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Thus, to stay competitive, companies rely on sophisticated information systems and logistic skills, and especially accurate and reliable forecasting systems. However, forecasters have to deal with some singular constraints of the textileapparel market such as for instance the volatile demand, the strong seasonality of sales, the wide number of items with short life cycle or the lack of historical data. To respond to these constraints, companies have implemented specific forecasting systems often simple but robust. After the study of existing practices in the clothing industry, we propose different forecasting models which perform more accurate and more reliable sales forecasts. These models rely on advanced methods such as fuzzy logic, neural networks and data mining. In order to evaluate the benefits of these methods for the supply chain and more especially for the reduction of the bullwhip effect, a simulation based on real data of sourcing and forecasting processes is performed and analyzed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

On the other side, businesses start to introduce enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems applied to business intelligence and supply chain management. However, there are ERP providers with a variety of specifications and features of products, so it is necessary for an enterprise to select an adequate ERP supplier in terms of factors concerned. A ERP system in need of a considerable sum of corporate budget is expected to obtain optimal profits and effects of administration rather than cause the failure or bankruptcy after introduction thereto. A preliminary overall assessment prior to introduction can lessen such risk. A modified grey relational analysis (MGRA) applied to this study for generalizing criteria of selecting a ERP system in terms of literature review; moreover, industry experts concerned participated in the questionnaires survey. The criteria were assessed under the importance. Finally, the scores obtained were analyzed and outcomes were ranked in terms of GRA as the references to decision-makers of businesses for selecting ERP providers among so many options.},

A stochastic inventory approach is proposed and incorporated into a multiperiod two-stage stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model to handle uncertainty in demand and loss or addition of customers. This nonconvex MINLP formulation takes into account customer synergies and simultaneously predicts the optimal sizes of customers' storage tanks, the safety stock levels, and the estimated delivery cost for replenishments. To globally optimize this stochastic MINLP problem with modest computational time, we develop a tailored branch-and-refine algorithm based on successive piecewise-linear approximation. The solution from the stochastic MINLP is fed into a detailed routing model with a shorter planning horizon to determine the optimal deliveries, replenishments, and inventories. A clustering-based heuristic is proposed for solving the routing model with reasonable computational effort. Three case studies including instances with up to 200 customers are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic models and solution algorithms. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The fierce competitions in supply chain are changing the conventional buyer-seller relationship, which leads to undermine business strengths. To respond this transformation, strategic partnership has been gaining increasing attention. However, recent research points out that it still lacks the methodology to optimize the existing suppliers that would help buyer establish long-term relationship. This paper proposes a two-phase Domain Driven Data Mining (DDDM) methodology for strategic supplier selection. Phase one is termed domain knowledge acquisition and analysis, while phase two is supplier set optimization. Meanwhile, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), set theory and association rule mining are included in the two phases. Furthermore, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the proposed supplier selection model. Simulation results indicate that it is more efficient than single AHP or association rule algorithm. In short, the proposed model employs both qualitative subjective judgments and quantitative objective data to select strategic suppliers. It optimizes the existing suppliers, which would provide the basis for the buyer establishing long-term relationships with fewer suppliers. © 2010 International Information Institute.},

	abstract = {Modern production planning and inventory control has been developed in order to treat more practical and more complicated circumstances, such as researching supply chain instead of single stock point; multi-items with correlation instead of single item and so on. In this paper, how to classify inventory items which are correlated each other is discussed by using the concept of 'cross-selling effect'. In history, the ABC classification is usually used for inventory items aggregation because the number of inventory items is so large that it is not computationally feasible to set stock and service control guidelines for each individual item. A fundamental principle in ABC classification is that ranking all inventory items with respect to a notion of profit based on historical transactions. The difficulty is that the profit of one item not only comes from its own sales, but also from its influence on the sales of other items or reverse, i.e.; the 'cross-selling effect'. We had previously developed a classification approach for inventory items by using the association rules to deal with the 'cross-selling effect' and found that a very different classification can be obtained when comparing with traditional ABC classification. However, the 'cross-selling effect' may be considered in different ways. In this paper, a new consideration of inventory classification based on loss rule is presented. The lost profit of item/itemset with 'cross-selling effect' is discussed and defined as criterion for evaluating of importance of item, based on which new algorithms on classifying inventory items, also on discovering maximum profit item selection, are presented. A simple example is used to explain the new algorithm, and large amount of empirical experiments, both on real database collected from Japanese convenient store and on downloaded benchmark database, are implemented to evaluate the performances on effectiveness and utility. The results show that the proposed approach in this paper can gain a well insight into the cross-selling effect among items and is applicable for large-sized transaction database. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Physically-based models derive from first principles (e.g. physical laws) and rely on known variables and parameters. Because these have physical meaning, they also explain the underlying relationships of the system and are usually transportable from one system to another as a structural entity. They only require model parameters to be updated. Data-driven or regressive techniques involve data mining for modelling and one of the major drawbacks of this is that the functional form describing relationships between variables and the numerical parameters is not transportable to other physical systems as is the case with their classical physically-based counterparts. Aimed at striking a balance. Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR) offers a way to model multi-utility data of asset deterioration in order to render model structures transportable across physical systems. EPR is a recently developed hybrid regression method providing symbolic expressions for models and works with formulae based on pseudo-polynomial expressions, usually in a multi-objective scenario where the best Pareto optimal models (parsimony versus accuracy) are selected from data in a single case study.

	abstract = {Service providers are continually looking for new applications to increase revenues, enhance the end user experience, and be a part of an emerging next-generation services value chain. Service providers can play an important role in this emerging market by leveraging data mining and analytics. In this paper, we propose an analytics engine (AE), an application enabler that accepts inputs from various sources in real time and non-real time, such as subscriber historic, static, dynamic, and application data available in the service provider's network and from external sources including end users. It analyzes the data to develop and continuously refine user profiles that can be used by other applications. There is a growing demand for real time business intelligence which correlates to a shift in how that information is being used. The idea is to use some small aggregate summary output of analytics to help guide the real time decisions, such as in providing relevant advertising and in service simplification/personalization. Use of an analytics engine will enable service providers quickly to monetize information available in their networks today. © 2008 Alcatel-Lucent.},

The goal of this paper is to use a hybrid mining approach for analyzing return patterns from both the customer and product perspectives, classifying customers and products into levels, and then for adopting proper returns policies and marketing strategies to these customer classes for sustaining better profits. A multi-dimensional framework and an associated model for the hybrid mining approach are provided with a demonstrated example for validation.

The optimal integrated inventory management (IIM) policy is developed using stochastic dynamic programming theory. The IIM policy is contrasted with two pull-type vendor-managed inventory policies (VMI-1 and VMI-2) and a traditional retailer-managed inventory policy (RMI). Computational results show that in such stochastic supply chains, IIM performs about 23, 15, and 3% better than the optimised RMI, VMI-1 and VMI-2 policies, respectively, while two VMI policies are about 8 and 20% better than the best RMI. The basestock-based VMI-2 is a very good form of VMI. The ANOVA analysis reveals that the replenishment lead-times have the largest effect on the relative performance between IIM and other policies. Numerical examples demonstrated that the IIM policy has good structural properties and can be characterised by a set of switching curves.},

	abstract = {Location-allocation problems arise in several contexts, including supply chain and data mining. In its most common interpretation, the basic problem consists of optimally locating facilities and allocating customers to facilities so as to minimize the total cost. The standard approach to solving location-allocation problems is to model alternative location sites and customers as discrete entities. Many problem instances in practice involve dense demand data and uncertainties about the cost and locations of the potential sites. The use of discrete models is often inappropriate in such cases. This paper presents an alternative methodology where the market demand is modeled as a continuous density function and the resulting formulation is solved by means of calculus techniques. The methodology prioritizes the allocation decisions rather than location decisions, which is the common practice in the location literature. The solution algorithm proposed in this framework is a local search heuristic (steepest-descent algorithm) and is applicable to problems where the allocation decisions are in the form of polygons, e.g., with Euclidean distances. Extensive computational experiments confirm the efficiency of the proposed methodology. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent increases in energy prices, the rise in natural gas demand due to the concerns over CO2 emissions and a possible carbon tax, the development of a low-cost and high-capacity liquefied natural gas (LNG) value chain, the emergence of new suppliers with large gas reserves, the flow of uncommitted LNG capacity to the market, and the disappearance of conventional clauses such as destination are stimulating global LNG trade. Moreover, natural gas liberalization is resulting in the emergence of new buyers with variable demands, which is increasing the competitiveness and dynamicity of the LNG market. The LNG contracts are thus diversifying in price formulations, flexibility, duration, quality, quantity, commitment, discount, and other terms and conditions. Finding a combination of contracts and suppliers, which trades off various cost factors in an optimal manner, is becoming more and more challenging, where systematic optimization-based approaches can be very useful. In this study, we address contract selection from the perspective of an LNG buyer company. We develop a mixed-integer linear programming formalism that helps the buyer select the best combination of suppliers and contracts in an integrated manner that addresses various aspects, such as contract timings and lengths, demands, price formulations, volume discounts, delivery terms, shipment costs, purchase commitments, etc. We minimize the sum of purchase and transport costs, and we illustrate our approach using three examples with diverse and realistic features. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {In this work, we for the first time study the inter-industrial clustering behaviors of integrated circuit (IC) industry from Taiwan to China via amount of foreign direct investment (FDI). According to the mutual dependence among IC design, manufacturing and packaging-and-testing industries, Lotka-Volterra model is solved to explore the cluster evolutions. Effects of inter-level collaborations along production value chain on FDI flows into China are considered. Evolution of FDI into China for IC design industry significantly inspires the subsequent FDI of IC manufacturing, packaging and testing industries. Since the production of IC manufacturing, packing and testing enterprises depends on the preceded products that design industry has devised, the middle-stream manufacturing and downstream packaging-and-testing firms tend to converge toward upstream design houses. Taiwan IC industry's FDI amount into China is estimated to be cumulatively increasing, which suggests the clustering tendency of Taiwan IC industry. Prediction of FDI with Lotka-Volterra model is superior to that of the conventional growth model (i.e., Bass model) because the industrial mutualism among various stages is included. The flows of FDI have not yet reached equilibrium points, so the FDI inflows into China will expand for IC design or packaging-and-testing industry, while decline for manufacturing industry. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In studies on collective learning processes hi clusters it often remains unclear who is involved and in which area a local knowledge base is built up. This study contributes to filling this gap by unravelling the learning process and focusing on how learning takes place at the level of artisanal subcontractors. Empirical evidence from two sub-sectors in the furniture cluster hi Pampanga (the Philippines) is used to identify learning processes among subcontractors, indicating how knowledge is transferred along the value chain and diffused among them. The paper demonstrates that knowledge hardly trickles down from exporters, but that subcontractors are a major source of feedback to them. However, despite possessing the key strategic product knowledge, the subcontractors' absence of knowledge in other areas (i.e. technical, managerial and market knowledge) weakens their bargaining position in this cluster. © 2005 by the Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the business environment is characterized by great uncertainty and variability. In this environment, information technology (IT) has proved to be an important strategic ingredient for the creation of competitive advantage. This role of IT has been widely accepted during the past few years [Feeny D. Creating and sustaining competitive advantage with IT. In: Earl M, editor. Information management the strategic direction. Oxford, 1990; Ives B. Wingtip Courriers, Southern Methodist University Case Study #SMY/MIS/90-01, Edwin L. Cox School of Business, Dallas, TX, January 1990]. In the new era of production, strategic priorities rather than a cost contained focus have proved to be important for competition, namely: quality, dependability, flexibility, customer service, after sale service, supply chain management, etc. IT proved to be vital for successful competition as it can facilitate the attainment of these strategic targets. In this paper, the impact of IT on financial performance for the different types and levels of business strategy is examined. After the clustering of firms according to their strategic priorities, the effect of IT on financial performance is estimated. To do this a cross-sectional study was held in the field of Greek manufacturing firms that apply advanced IT, in order to explore which, how and in what level manufacturing priorities have been adopted. For that purpose, cluster analysis and VACOR algorithm were used, to distinguish clusters of firms and estimate the effect of IT on financial performance, for each type and level of strategic choice. Return on invested capital (ROIC) has been used as a criterion of performance in order to incorporate the effect of cost, revenues and profits. It was found that the effect of IT on financial performance was observed to be greater for firms which emphasize the higher level of flexibility strategy and the middle level of cost strategy. On the contrary, the effect of IT on performance was observed to be greater for firms which emphasize a lower level of quality and innovation strategy. Further discussion of these results and conclusions were drawn. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Next-generation networks will create environments populated with a vast number of consumers, which will possess diverse types of context-aware devices. In such environments, the consumer should be able to access all the available services anytime, from any place, and by using any of its communication-enabled devices. Consequently, next-generation networks will require efficient mechanisms which can match consumers' demands (requested services) to network-operators' supplies (available services). The authors propose an agent approach for enabling autonomous coordination between all the entities across the telecom value chain, thus enabling automated context-aware service provisioning for the consumers. Furthermore, the authors hope that the proposed service discovery model will not only be interesting from a scientific point of view, but also amenable to real-world applications.

While the effect of this increased specialization has been a narrowing of the scope of OR's interest in forecasting, research from an OR perspective remains vigorous. OR has been more receptive than other disciplines to the specialist research published in the forecasting journals, capitalizing on some of their key findings. In this paper, we identify the particular topics of OR interest over the past 25 years. After a brief summary of the current research in forecasting methods, we examine those topic areas that have grabbed the attention of OR researchers: computationally intensive methods and applications in operations and marketing. Applications in operations have proved particularly important, including the management of inventories and the effects of sharing forecast information across the supply chain. The second area of application is marketing, including customer relationship management using data mining and computer-intensive methods. The paper concludes by arguing that the unique contribution that OR can continue to make to forecasting is through developing models that link the effectiveness of new forecasting methods to the organizational context in which the models will be applied. The benefits of examining the system rather than its separate components are likely to be substantial. © 2008 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

First the decentralized system in which the supplier and the retailers are independent, profit-maximizing participants with the supplier acting as a Stackelberg game leader is studied. Numerical examples illustrate the importance of the coordination. The conventional quantity discount mechanism needs to be modified to coordinate the supply chain, so a revenue-sharing contract is proposed to coordinate such supply chain. Lastly, a special decision under certain demand rates is studied. The pricing and replenishment policies can be decided sequentially, which yields much less loss comparing with optimal decision when the demand rates are sufficiently large. © 2007 The Second Academy of China Aerospace Science & Industry Cooperation.},

Doing so requires "know-who" knowledge-knowledge of who knows what inside (or outside) the organization. This paper develops the concept of a knowledge directory, a database that can be searched via query. The knowledge directory returns a list of individuals rank ordered by the mutual affinity between their own areas of expertise and the content of the query. The technology behind the matching of person and query is centering resonance analysis, which develops a knowledge map, representing objects embedded in text as a network graph. We also present a way to analyze a collection of knowledge maps so that clusters of people who have similar expertise may be identified. We apply these techniques to a group of ten university faculty from the areas of industrial engineering, operations management, and supply chain management. Experiments attempting to match queries to specific faculty members are presented and discussed, and clustering techniques are used to show how the faculty aggregate into cliques of similar content and methodological expertise. Extensions of the method are discussed.},

We propose a new algorithm for this problem that proves to be more effective than previously existing methods. The algorithm features a path relinking approach, which is a mechanism for generating new solutions by combining two or more reference solutions. It also features an ejection chain approach, which is embedded in a neighborhood construction to create more complex and powerful moves. Computational comparisons on benchmark instances show that the method is not only effective in general, but is especially effective for types D and E instances, which are known to be very difficult. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Data are lacking, however, on the sensitivity of the monitoring programmes, as designed under the EU Drinking Water Directive. In this study, the sensitivity of such a monitoring programme was evaluated by hydraulic model simulations of contamination events and calculations of the detection probability of the actual sampling programme of 2002. In the hydraulic model simulations of 16-h periods of 1 l h-1 ingress of untreated domestic sewage, the spread of the contamination through the network and the E. coli concentration dynamics were calculated. The results show that when large parts of the sewage reach reservoirs, e.g. when they originate from the treatment plant or a trunk main, mean detection probabilities are 55-65%. When the contamination does not reach any of the reservoirs, however, the detection probability varies from 0% (when no sampling site is reached) to 13% (when multiple sites are reached). Mean detection probabilities of nine simulated ingress incidents in mains are 5.5% with an SD of 6.5%. In reality, these detection probabilities are probably lower as the study assumed no inactivation or clustering of E. coli, 100% recovery efficiency of the E. coli detection methods and immediate mixing of contaminations in mains and reservoirs. The described method provides a starting point for automated evaluations and optimisations of sampling programmes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, although the concept of clustering is widely used, there is no clear consensus of what actually constitutes a cluster. In this paper, we develop a dynamic cluster concept. This cluster concept places one particular value chain as central. First, on the basis of the literature we describe a number of characteristics for identifying a cluster. Second, we develop a stylised cluster cycle, with states of development, expansion, maturity and transition. The development of a cluster in these states stems from external contingent events as well as the internal dynamic of clusters. This dynamic cluster concept can be used to formulate policy alternatives for the different cluster states. We use the dynamic cluster concept to analyse the shipbuilding industry in the Northern Netherlands. This cluster went through the states of development and expansion and now shows signs of maturation. The cluster is described and possible policies to support it are suggested.},

	abstract = {Due to the tremendous increase and variations in serial publications, the impact of every peer-reviewed paper on different subjects is varying continually. Domain experts or researchers want to keep track of those latest and highly cited peer-reviewed papers; however they are finding it difficult to update or collect their subject core paper lists regularly and accurately. The evaluation of serial papers for generating and ranking core paper lists on different subjects becomes a very challenging task for scholars or librarians. Therefore, a computer-aided bibliometric system (CABS) was developed to generate a core article ranked list automatically. Four indicators - subject reference cited counts, subject total cited counts, subject reference period impact and subject reference cited history - were proposed to generate a subject core article ranking list. Seven different subjects including E-commerce, Data Mining, Supply Chain, Image Processing, Enterprise Resource Planning, Microarray and Expert Systems were used as samples. The turning point (TP) was proposed to determine the core article area in the paper citation analysis. The TP patterns observed were that all TPs had the same rate for four different subjects. The usage of TP patterns can also be used to verify the experimental results. This study provides experimental evidence to disprove three myths. Myth 1: the top papers on a subject (for instance, the top 10 papers) were all submitted to (S)SCI journals. Myth 2: the highly cited papers (cited counts >4) on interdisciplinary subjects were almost submitted to (S)SCI journals. Myth 3: the articles published in the top journals on a subject would be highly cited. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Often the literature on clustering implicitly assumes national or regional-sectoral agglomeration to be a general phenomenon applying to all or most businesses. We argue that not all industries are equally affected by the process of clustering. Therefore, the question on how to assess the relevance of clustering for a particular company or industry becomes important. It is deduced that those industries with a divisible production process and a transportable product or service fulfil the necessary conditions for clustering. A long value-chain including multiple distinct competencies, innovation-intensity characterised by "network-innovations" and the volatility of markets further increase the potential for an industry to cluster. Besides providing a heuristic for strategic management, this paper alerts regional planners that only in those regions whose economic structure is characterised by industries subject to clustering, the promotion of local network-building is relevant. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A resource-based view of strategic management is adopted to highlight the importance of resources and capabilities. The study here also addresses the recent interest in the effect of R&D clustering on innovation and thus on firm competitiveness. The present study explores the influence of innovative capabilities and clustering effects along the value chain of the Taiwanese integrated circuit (IC) industry. The empirical results indicate that innovative capabilities are mostly positively related to performance as measured by returns on assets (ROA). Specifically, higher R&D intensity and higher R&D manpower are found to be predictors of improved firm performance. Additionally, firms at various stages of the value delivering process are seen to have differentiated innovative capability characteristics. A noteworthy result is that low and moderate levels of R&D clustering demonstrate positively moderating power to the relationship between innovative capability and performance. However, the hypothesis that further R&D clustering would eventually reduce the impact of innovative capability on firm performance was not confirmed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Individual analysis is used to extract the respective, critical successful factors in the technique and management aspects. Based on such key factors, fuzzy clustering method is applied to categorize the firms into three distinct patterns, namely “Excellent performance”, “Requiring improvement” and “Management leading”. Results may help the managers better focus on these key success factors, thus, enhancing each firms' logistic technology and adjust management strategy. The technology aspects focus the following binary-factors: inventory & delivery, quickness and friendliness, and sales & distribution. The management aspects focus on inventory strategy, supply chain integration, and customer service. All three firms are invited to refer to these findings, to the ways of adjusting logistic technology and management strategy relevant for each distinct pattern of use. Business performances are then described in terms of the technique characteristics and management system. Finally, each firm can identify its position in relation to the industry as a whole, and instigate changes to the management system and utilize the recommended means designed to promote its performance. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Purpose The integration of e-business and supply chain enables seamless information flow from suppliers to customer service network via the internet. It also enables better-coordinated materials flow from customer order to production, storage, distribution and delivery. The purpose of this paper is to describe the work that leads to the realisation of a hierarchical model for e-supply chain coordination and optimisation. Design/methodology/approach The model is based on an e-business information flow network in order to respond rapidly to the dynamics of e-supply chain and market. It can be used to realize management level strategies, and facilitate the planning and control of detailed operation schedules of supply chain units in an e-supply chain environment. Three main modules are discussed. They are routing and sequence optimiser (RSO) with the aid of a GA and TS-based multiple population search strategy (MPSS): supply chain virtual clustering (SCVC) based on fuzzy virtual clustering: and supply chain order scheduling (SCOS) using an agent-based distributed scheduling system. Findings These modules enable: the generation of preferred routings, transportation modes and work order plan under such constraints as customer service level, cycle time and cost: the formation of supply chain's unit-transportation-work order families using a clustering approach to down-size supply chain problems and increase computation efficiency: and the integration of scheduling with supply chain optimisation in order to facilitate the control of a supply chain with the aid of an agent-based distributed scheduling approach. Originality/value This paper proposed a hierarchical model for e-supply chain coordination and optimisation that is capable to solve large-scale problems.

	abstract = {Doubts have been raised about the value of cluster-promotion policy given the lack of agreement over how clusters are identified. Such criticism overlooks how clusters are sometimes a mode of inquiry rather than a specific pattern of industrial location. The desire to promote business clusters is connected to a real phenomenon, but policy needs to acknowledge that exemplar clusters do not provide a role model for how other local economies may develop and that industry and market characteristics affect the significance of clustering. Efforts to promote business clusters in New Zealand show how the perceptions of cluster opportunities by business managers differ from those expected by policymakers. A review of twenty-five cluster initiatives identifies six ways that the projects question widespread opportunity to benefit from encouraging localised business collaboration: (1) value-chain division, (2) conditions on cooperation, (3) the need to go national, (4) facilitator dependence, (5) need for a leader, and (6) missing clusters. Policy intervention should be based on determining how best to work with groups of variable significance and character rather than being driven by idealised interpretations of cluster development. © 2005 a Pion publication printed in Great Britain.},

Effective supplier selection calls for robust analytical methods and decision-support tools. This research aims to develop a supplier selection methodology based on extended quality function deployment (QFD) and data-mining (DM) techniques. Through considering customer requirement and performance of components in a product's full life-cycle, the manufacturer can use data-mining techniques to find out quality requirements correlated to customer categories, product usage patterns, and frequent fault patterns in order to select the proper combination of suppliers. In this way, the manufacturer can decrease costs, raise product quality, and improve customer satisfaction. Related data-mining algorithms for supplier selection are presented. Customer requirement analysis is also studied in the paper, and transcendental and empirical customer requirement analysis methods are put forward. A case study is provided in detail. Finally, as a part of the supply-chain management system, a supplier selection prototype system is designed and implemented. Evaluation of experiments in an automobile manufacturing enterprise verifies the feasibility and efficiency of our method.},

The literature reveals that new information and telecommunication technologies (ICTs) have been driving new economic activities into a number of cities and regions with well-developed information infrastructures while within these cities and regions new industries tend to disperse as a result of the safe and sufficient communications across distance enabled by new ICTs. This finding suggests that the application of new ICTs is a strong decentralizing force in a firm's location at the local scale. It is against such a background that this paper examines the Xingwang Industrial Park located in the Beijing Economic and Technological Development Area (BDA) as a case study to focus on the dynamics of local industrial clusters enabled by new ICTs. The authors argue that new ICTs are an enabling or facilitating agent rather than a deterministic force. The application of new ICTs tends to lead to a "virtual clustering" of firms as this is an essential step of integration of supply chains while whether or not suppliers choose to locate in proximity to each other and to assemblers depends on a number of other factors. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The aim of this study is to investigate the dual impact of regional clusters on the development of local clustering and networking ties. In this respect the positive impact in terms of technology transfers, financial support and market access are analysed alongside potentially more detrimental aspects, such as replacing local value-adding processes with roundwood and paperwood exports and limiting the international marketing options of the acquired producers. The results indicate that regional clustering has several positive influences on the development of local/domestic wood and forest clusters in terms of technology transfer and foreign market access, but dominant intra-corporate networks can also lead to centralised operations that set a lower value on local supply chain relationships.

	abstract = {Research on warehousing systems has gained interest since the 1980s, reflecting the fact that supply chain management has pursued a demand-driven organization with high product variety, small order sizes, and reliable short response times throughout the supply chain. This market trend has affected warehouse management and operations tremendously. Order batching in a warehouse attempts to achieve high-volume order processing operations by consolidating small orders into batches. Order batching is an essential operation of order processing in which several orders are grouped into batches. This paper describes the development of an order batching approach based on data mining and integer programming. It is valuable to discover the important associations between orders such that the occurrence of some orders in a batch will cause the occurrence of other orders in the same batch. An order-clustering model based on 0-1 integer programming can be formulated to maximize the associations between orders within each batch. From the results of several test problems, the proposed approach shows its ability to find quality solutions of order batching problems. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Although efficient, these systems are neither versatile nor adaptive, since newly discovered customer trends cannot be easily integrated with existing knowledge. Advancing on the way the above mentioned techniques apply on ERP systems, we have developed a multi-agent system that introduces adaptive intelligence as a powerful add-on for ERP software customization. The system can be thought of as a recommendation engine, which takes advantage of knowledge gained through the use of data mining techniques, and incorporates it into the resulting company selling policy. The intelligent agents of the system can be periodically retrained as new information is added to the ERP. In this paper, we present the architecture and development details of the system, and demonstrate its application on a real test case. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The ability automatically to detect, diagnose, and distinguish between the causes of disturbances is of prime importance to decision makers in order to avoid uncertainty. The spectral principal component analysis (SPCA) technique has been utilized to distinguish between real and rogue disturbances in a steel supply network. The data set used was collected from four different business units in the network and consists of 43 variables; each is described by 72 data points. The present paper will utilize the same data set to test an alternative approach to SPCA in detecting the disturbances. The new approach employs statistical data pre-processing, clustering, and classification learning techniques to analyse the supply network data. In particular, the incremental k-means clustering and the RULES-6 classification rule-learning algorithms, developed by the present authors' team, have been applied to identify important patterns in the data set. Results show that the proposed approach has the capability automatically to detect and characterize network-wide cyclical disturbances and generate hypotheses about their root cause. © IMechE 2007.},

	abstract = {The drive to cut costs continually and focus on core competencies has driven many companies to outsource some or all of their production. Unlike the past, companies can no longer concentrate only on their own internal business operations, but have to work with customers and suppliers effectively and efficiently. The integration of customer demand and supplier capability to facilitate supplier management using data mining and artificial intelligence technologies has become a promising solution for outsourced-type companies in outsourcing manufacturing operations to suitable suppliers. The result is to form a supply network on which they depend on the provision of products and services. In this paper, a supplier knowledge management system (SKMS) is introduced for such a purpose. By using its hybrid on-line analytical processing (OLAP)/artificial neural networks (ANNs)/case-based reasoning (CBR) approach in predicting future customer demands and allocating suitable suppliers during the order fulfilment process, it is found that the overall efficiency in the whole supply chain is greatly enhanced. A case study using the SKMS to integrate the order subcontracting system of Farnell Newark-InOne (Shanghai) Limited is presented. Through the use of the SKMS, the demand of customers is related to the supplier's capabilities both efficiently and effectively while, at the same time, valuable supplier knowledge is also accumulated by the company. © IMechE 2007.},

The old agglomerations of pharmacy are no longer leaders in knowledge exploration, as universities, research laboratories and medical schools take over research, they are beginning to lose prominence to dedicated biotechnology firms (DBFs) in knowledge examination, and retain their most important involvement as financiers and marketers of DBF exploitation knowledge.

	abstract = {Standardization has been a powerful strategy in consumer markets, but it's reached the point of diminishing returns. And diversity is not the only chink in standardization's armor: Attempts to build stores in the remaining attractive locations often meet fierce resistance from community activists. From California to Florida to New Jersey, neighborhoods are passing ordinances that dictate the sizes and even architectural styles of new shops. Building more of the same-long the cornerstone of retailer growth-seems to be tapped out as a strategy. Of course, a company can't customize every element of its business in every location. Strategists have begun to use clustering techniques to simplify and smooth out decision making and to focus their efforts on the relatively small number of variables that usually drive the bulk of consumer purchases. The customization-by-clusters approach, which began as a strategy for grocery stores in 1995, has since proven effective in drugstores, department stores, mass merchants, big-box retailers, restaurants, apparel companies, and a variety of consumer goods manufacturers. Clustering sorts things into groups, so that the associations are strong between members of the same cluster and weak between members of different clusters. In fact, by centiahzing data-intensive and scale-sensitive functions (such as store design, merchandise assortment, buying, and supply chain management), localization libetates store personnel to do what they do best: Test innovative solutions to local challenges and forge strong bonds with communities. Ultimately, all companies serving con suiners will fate the challenge of local customization. We are advancing to a world where the strategies of the most successful businesses will be as diverse as the com munities they serve.},

Design-methodology-approach The DCAR algorithm first identifies the domain-concept from the demand history and then performs association rule mining to find associations among machines. After that, the algorithm forms machine-cells with a series of inclusion and exclusion processes to minimize inter-cell material movement and intra-cell void element costs as well as to maximize the grouping efficacy with the constraints of bill of material (BOM) and the maximum number of machines allowed for each cell. Findings The DCAR algorithm delivers either comparable or better results than the existing approaches using known binary datasets. The paper demonstrates that the DCAR can obtain satisfying machine-cells with production costs when extra parameters are needed. Research limitations-implications The DCAR algorithm adapts the idea of the sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) to iteratively evaluate and arrange machine-cells until the result is stabilized. The SFFS is an improvement over a greedy version of the algorithm, but can only ensure sub-optimal solutions. Practical implications – The DCAR algorithm considers a wide range of production parameters, which make the algorithm suitable to the real-world manufacturing system settings. Originality-value The proposed DCAR algorithm is unlike other array-based algorithms. It can group non-binary MC matrix with considerations of real-world factors including product demand, BOM, costs, and maximum number of machines allowed for each cell. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

In contrast to the wavelet analysis, the paper presents a new approach called S-transform-based time frequency analysis in processing power quality disturbance data. Certain pertinent feature vectors are extracted using the well-known wavelet methods and the new approach using S-transform. Neural networks are then used to compute the classification accuracy of the feature vectors. Certain characteristics of the wavelet feature vectors are apparent from the results. Further in large data sets partitioning is done and similarities of pattern vectors present in different sections are determined. The approach is a general one and can be applied to pattern classification, similarity determination, and knowledge discovery in time varying data patterns occurring in many practical sciences and engineering problems. © 2006.},

The framework comprises three main modules: routing and sequence optimization, supply chain virtual clustering and supply chain order scheduling. It is envisaged that the hierarchical model can be used to realize management level strategies, facilitate planning and optimize the detailed operation schedules of various supply chain units in a supply chain. The detailed design of a multiple population search strategy (MPSS) based on genetic algorithm (GA) and tabu search (TS) for routing selection and operation sequence optimization is presented. Using the tabu search, the crossover and mutation rates of GA can be made adaptive to suit different stages of search. The results show that the MPSS is not only able to reach a better solution, but also able to reduce the computational time. The work has also demonstrated the possibility of adopting a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of the tabu search and genetic algorithms for the optimization of routing and sequence in a supply chain in order to achieve management level objectives such as minimizing cost and increasing the level of on-time delivery.},

	abstract = {Recent economic pressures have forced the Australian sugar industry to achieve better integration and optimization of the cane harvesting and transport sectors of the value chain. The logistical and economic complexity of the harvesting and transport system was captured through the development of a modelling framework that effectively links several component models that describe the parts of the system. Through engaging in participatory research with representatives of a sugar region located at the north-east coast of Australia, we use this modelling framework to address some key industry issues in rationalizing rail track infrastructure and re-organizing harvesting. These issues were addressed by building component models for the modelling framework in the field of location science, namely the capacitated P-Median problem and spatial clustering. By applying the modelling framework and its component models to the case-study region, we explored a range of scenarios with a net cost reduction of up to AU$2 260000 per year. © 2006 Operational Research Society Ltd.

	abstract = {This study deals with solving uncapacitated location-allocation (LA) problems with rectilinear distances by using a method based on Kohonen self-organizing feature maps (SOFMs). By treating LA problems as clustering problems, this method has the advantage of extracting the structure of the input data by a self-organizing process based on adaptation rules. In this paper, a heuristic method is constructed by using SOFMs with a guided refining procedure, and its performance is compared with simulated annealing. The experimental results using the proposed guided refining procedure to reinforce the SOFM method show that the proposed method is excellent in terms of quality of solution and speed of computation. In addition, the experimental results suggest that SOFMs may provide an excellent approach when generating initial solutions for other heuristic or exact algorithms. This conjecture is made because most of the solutions yielded by SOFM are close to the optimal solution in all experiments. Scope and purpose Given the location of a set of customers with different demands, the LA problem is to select the locations of a number of supply centers to serve the customers and to decide the corresponding allocation of the customers to supply centers under a given optimization criterion. The LA problem may arise in fire stations, hospitals, police stations, telecommunication networks, and warehouses relative to production facilities and customers. In addition, the recent rapid growth of demand for supply chain management, which can decrease the total cost, while improving the quality of goods and services of various organizations, has drawn significant research attention. As an important part of supply chain management, the LA problem is related to the facility management service, logistics and distribution, order entry and customer service operations. Therefore, it should be indicated much more than before for organizations to improve their competitive advantage. In solving the LA problem, the costs of transportation between customers and supply centers are proportional to an appropriately determined distance, e.g. the Euclidean distance or rectilinear distance. The location of supply centers and the allocation of customers to supply centers must be considered simultaneously. The capacities of supply centers in LA problems can either be fixed or treated without any limitation if the capacity of each supply center can be adjusted according to the amount of allocated service demands of customers, which are referred to as capacitated and uncapacitated problems, respectively. In addition, the assumption of no interaction between supply centers makes LA problems different from p-hub problems. Currently, existing algorithms for solving the LA problems cannot meet the demands of rapidly changing industrial or market environments, since they are either time consuming or provide poor-quality solutions. Therefore, in this article, we propose a heuristic method using Kohonen's feature maps, which are artificial neural networks capable of mapping the distribution of input data to specified neurons, with a guided refining procedure to solve uncapacitated LA problems. In addition, the investigation of appropriateness of using Kohonen's feature maps (called SOFMs) as an initial solution-generating method for another heuristic or exact method is also provided. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The economic and social costs associated with pipe bursts and associated leakage problems in modern water supply systems are rapidly rising to unacceptably high levels. Pipe burst risks depend on a number of factors which are extremely difficult to characterise. A part of the problem is that water supply assets are mainly situated underground, and therefore not visible and under influence of various highly unpredictable forces. This paper proposes the use of advanced data mining methods in order to determine the risks of pipe bursts. For example, analysis of the database of already occurred bursts events can be used to establish a risk model as a function of associated characteristics of bursting pipe (its age, diameter, material of which it is built, etc.), soil type in which a pipe is laid, climatological factors (such as temperature), traffic loading, etc. In addition to the immediate aid with the the choice of pipes to be replaced, the outlined approach opens completely new avenues in asset management: the one of asset modeling. The condition of an asset such as a water supply network deteriorates with age. With reliable risk models, addressing the evolution of risk with aging asset, it is now possible to plan optimal rehabilitation strategies in advance, before the burst actually occurs. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

China is also integrating with the regional trading bloc in E&SE Asia, while no comparable bloc has emerged in South Asia.

	abstract = {This paper describes the work that led to the realisation of an extended graph-based virtual clustering-enhanced approach to supply chain optimisation. The Supply-Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model defined by the Supply-Chain Council in Pittsburgh, PA, USA is used to denote a typical supply chain, which may include geographically distributed suppliers, warehouses, factories, distribution centres (DCs), transportation and customers. A graph representation is proposed to represent and analyse the business processes of the SCOR model from customer orders to suppliers. Furthermore, logical relationships are superimposed onto the graph. This extended graph enables the complex relationships between the nodes of two adjoining layers to be described. By so doing, it is able to model a complex supply chain with multiple level assembly, various types of transportations and a multiple split and merge of orders. In order to handle a largescale supply chain optimisation problem, the extended graph is enhanced by virtual clustering so as to realise an approach that is able to downscale the optimisation problem and reduce the search space. A case study is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The details of the SCOR model, the extended graph, the virtual clustering, the proposed approach and the case study are presented in this paper.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of constructing order batches for distribution centers using a data mining technique. With the advent of supply chain management, distribution centers fulfill a strategic role of achieving the logistics objectives of shorter cycle times, lower inventories, lower costs and better customer service. Many companies consider both their cost effectiveness and market proficiency to depend primarily on efficient logistics management. Warehouse management system (WMS) presently is considered a key to strengthening company logistics. Order picking is routine in distribution centers. Before picking a large set of orders, effectively grouping orders into batches can accelerate product movement within the storage zone. The order batching procedure has to be implemented in WMS and may be run online many times daily. The literature has proposed numerous batching heuristics for minimizing travel distance or travel time. This paper presents a clustering procedure for an order batching problem in a distribution center with a parallel-aisle layout. A data mining technique of association rule mining is adopted to develop the order clustering approach. Performance comparisons between the developed approach and existing heuristics are given for various problems. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

From a research perspective, we classify the methods that are employed in the management of these chains, based on whether supply and/or demand are flexible or fixed. Interestingly, our classification scheme highlights a critical and rewarding research area, at which both supply and demand are flexible, thus manageable. Simultaneous management of supply and demand chains sets the stage for mass customization which is concerned with meeting the needs of an individualized customer market. Simultaneous and real-time management of supply and demand chains, in turn, set the stage for real-time mass customization (e.g. wherein a tailor first laser scans an individual's upper torso and then delivers a uniquely fitted jacket within a reasonable period, while the individual is waiting). The benefits of real-time mass customization cannot be over-stated as products and services become indistinguishable and are co-produced in real-time, resulting in an overwhelming economic advantage. Customized goods and services can only be achieved through sophisticated data mining techniques that can define the customization requirements from both a supply and a demand chain perspective, techniques that can obtain pertinent information from the mass of non-homogeneous data, in order to make informed customization decisions. © World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {When planning bioenergy production from biomass, planners should take into account each and every stakeholder along the biomass supply chains, e.g. biomass resources suppliers, transportation, conversion and electricity suppliers. Also, the planners have to consider social concerns, environmental and economical impacts related with establishing the biomass systems and the specific difficulties of each country. To overcome these problems in a sustainable manner, a robust decision support system is required. For that purpose, a two levels general Bioenergy Decision System (gBEDS) for bioenergy production planning and implementation was developed. The core part of the gBEDS is the information base, which includes the basic bioenergy information and the detailed decision information. Basic bioenergy information include, for instance, the geographical information system (GIS) database, the biomass materials' database, the biomass logistic database and the biomass conversion database. The detailed decision information considers the parameters' values database with their default values and the variables database, values obtained by simulation and optimization. It also includes a scenario database, which is used for demonstration to new users and also for case based reasoning by planners and executers. Based on the information base, the following modules are included to support decision making: the simulation module with graph interface based on the unit process (UP) definition and the genetic algorithms (GAs) methods for optimal decisions and the Matlab module for applying data mining methods (fuzzy C-means clustering and decision trees) to the biomass collection points, to define the location of storage and bioenergy conversion plants based on the simulation and optimization model developed of the whole life cycle of bioenergy generation. Furthermore, Matlab is used to set up a calculation model with crucial biomass planning parameters (e.g. costs, CO2 emissions), over the predefined biomass supply chains. The GIS based interface allows visualization of all bioenergy conversion plants and storage data to support the users' decision based on quantifiable outputs. With the help of the graphical interface, the users can define easily the feasible biomass supply chains, take decisions and evaluate them according to their own interests, might they be environmental, economical, social or others. Therefore, the gBEDS supports biomass energy planners in both national and regional levels to assess the options (technically and economically) of biomass utilization and plan for bioenergy generation in a competent and sustainable way. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Supply chain management has gained renewed interest among researchers in recent years. This is primarily due to the availability of timely information across the various stages of the supply chain, and therefore the need to effectively utilize the information for improved performance. Although information plays a major role in effective functioning of supply chains, there is a paucity of studies that deal specifically with the dynamics of supply chains and how data collected in these systems can be used to improve their performance. In this paper I develop a framework, with machine learning, for automated supply chain configuration. Supply chain configuration used to be mostly a one-shot problem. Once a supply chain is configured, researchers and practitioners were more interested in means to improve performance given that initial configuration. However, recent developments in e-commerce applications and faster communication over the Internet in general necessitates dynamic (re)configuration of supply chains over time to take advantage of better configurations. Using examples, I show performance improvements of the proposed adaptive supply chain configuration framework over static configurations. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Using a sample of 29 virtual clusters, the paper examines new sources of clustering in the digital economy. The “virtual cluster” phenomenon highlights the most significant effect of the development of the information and communication technologies in the business environment. A virtual cluster is conceived as an e-business community, made up of customers, suppliers, distributors and commerce providers sharing digital and knowledge networks for collaboration and competition. The purpose of this paper is to set out the characteristics of a new competitive space, in which a strategic role is played by virtual processes among partners, and to review the traditional sources of clustering in the digital economy environment (Romano et al., 1999). More specifically, this paper attempts to show the emerging overlap between digital and knowledge networks, which generates a new competitive space within a new global-virtual learning environment. Finally, assuming that traditional sources of clustering are generally identified in specialisation (based on a sophisticated division of labour) and geographic proximity, the paper discusses how the role of organisational proximity acts as a substitute for geographic proximity in supporting coordination and tacit knowledge exchange. As it emerges from the analysis of our cases, from a managerial point of view, organisational proximity may be achieved through the implementation of supply chain management (SCM) and customer relationship management (CRM) strategies.

Design/methodology/approach - The analytic network process is applied as the research methodology in the context of executive decisions that include qualitative and quantitative attributes. The decision model is presented, along with a case study with an e-supply chain of a global telecommunications company. Findings - The study develops a framework for measuring the relative importance of a particular dimension based on the application of theoretical concepts from the information systems and management science literature to the digital, knowledge economy. Since contextual factors play a critical role in the design of effective knowledge-management (KM) systems, technical and process solutions need to be customized to fit the organization performance criteria, dimensions of agility and supply chain drivers. Research limitations/implications - The model presented is dependent on the perceptual weightings provided by the decision-maker and the generalizability of findings based on our model to other organizations may be limited. Practical implications - This paper addresses the need for a strategic decision-making tool to assist management in determining which knowledge management construct is most beneficial in the development of an agile supply chain. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified information need and offers practical help in a dynamic and competitive environment by providing a decision model that assists in determining which construct of KM is most important based on an organization's performance criteria, dimensions of agility and supply-chain drivers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The dynamic growth of biotechnology in Germany in recent years has an obviously spatial pattern. Some regions show a substantial potential for start-ups and young firms of this new industry whereas others lag behind. The paper is discussing this unequal spatial development elaborating perspectives which derive from recent debates about regional innovation systems. The biotech regions Munich and Rhineland, both winner regions of the BioRegio Competition are described and compared with the situation in Hamburg where biotechnology is much less important. We analyze the degree and relevance of locally integrated input-output relations of innovation systems based on typologies of the wide range of firms within the biotechnological value chain and the forms of co-operation. Moreover, a qualitative estimate is given with respect to the significance of untraded relationships and regional knowledge spillovers. Factors favoring local integration are compared with those favoring input-output systems on a transatlantic scale. The paper discusses the question whether the biotech industries in the regions of Munich, Rhineland and Hamburg represent identifiable regional systems of innovation. Our findings show that the spatial concentration does not necessarily imply a close network of input-output relations within a cluster. Knowledge and technology transfer often happens on a international, mostly on the North Atlantic scale. The exchange of tacit knowledge, however, is facilitated by spatial proximity. This underlines the importance of untraded relations and "relational assets" in a region. Political and institutional support for building a "business community" can reduce barriers to launch risky commercialization processes.},

	abstract = {As the business environment gets more complicated, organizations must be able to respond to the business changes and adjust themselves quickly to gain their competitive advantages. This study proposes an integrated agent system, called SPA, which coordinates simulated and physical agents to provide an efficient way for organizations to meet the challenges in managing supply chains. In the integrated framework, physical agents coordinate with inter-organizations' physical agents to form workable business processes and detect the variations occurring in the outside world, whereas simulated agents model and analyze the what-if scenarios to support physical agents in making decisions. This study uses a supply chain that produces digital still cameras as an example to demonstrate how the SPA works. In this example, individual information systems of the involved companies equip with the SPA and the entire supply chain is modeled as a hierarchical object oriented Petri nets. The SPA here applies the modified AGNES data clustering technique and the moving average approach to help each firm generalize customers' past demand patterns and forecast their future demands. The amplitude of forecasting errors caused by bullwhip effects is used as a metric to evaluate the degree that the SPA affects the supply chain performance. The experimental results show that the SPA benefits the entire supply chain by reducing the bullwhip effects and forecasting errors in a dynamic environment. © Copyright JASSS.},

Based on a study of 198 suppliers operating in the food packaging machinery industry, structural equation modelling has revealed that customers actually assign suppliers different roles and give them varying levels of responsibility in the product development and manufacturing stages. These roles are correlated to the supplier's distinctive innovation capabilities. Clustering analysis is used to divide the suppliers into homogeneous groups. Innovative capabilities are not only associated with traditional competencies in R&D and product/process innovation but also in supportive capabilities in the form of absorptive capacity, technological scanning, innovation-oriented culture, skills and know-how of individuals and managerial practices. The impact of different innovative capabilities (both technological and managerial) on critical performance factors such as price, quality, time and flexibility is measured for each type of supplier in turn. The research findings lend support to the hypothesis that the level of investment in technology and the acquisition of specific managerial capabilities are, to a large extent, a determinant of supplier-customer interdependence. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The benefits of applying data mining to pharmacy practice, with a focus on the point of care, are discussed. Successful data mining often requires an enterprise-wide information system as a prerequisite. Data can then be collected electronically at all points in the health care supply chain. A strategic view of the information flow in an acute care setting is provided. To further illustrate the application of data mining, several examples of OLAP integration are given.

From a functional perspective, two distinctive hierarchies shape the multi-dimensionality of this architecture: a vertical hierarchy of agents and a horizontal hierarchical communication-coordination platform. The versatility of the proposed architecture (which supports practically any kind of collaborative application) and its recursive replication at all levels of resolution within the collaborative application are illustrated on a supply-chain example. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

	abstract = {The water distribution regulation system of Fukuoka City is a system in which motor valves are operated by remote control while pressure gauges and flow meters attached to distribution pipes are monitored. One of the main objectives of this system is to regulate pressure in all the network nodes between lower and upper target values. With the ever-increasing complexity of the city-wide distribution pipe network, motor valve operations to regulate pressure and flow came to depend more and more on the experience and skills of operators. For this reason, an improvement of valve operations support should be done based on valve operation planning for flow and pressure regulation, and the operation knowledge database which is constructed on the basis of past experience in order to prevent the events of pressure regulation falls outside the required target pressure range and also to reduce the effort of operators. Therefore in this study and with the assistance of three years of telemetry data, an analysis of the existing valve operation of a certain block within the city district is performed using both correlation analysis and an unsupervised class of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) named Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Results show that correlation analysis has successfully classified the operation types of different valves attached to the studied network into three categories while SOM is an efficient tool in clustering the different complicated operational patterns of valves, visualizing the huge amount of telemetry valves data, detecting the patterns which need future improvement and could present good alternative solutions for improving future valve operational support.},

	abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to propose a logistical network design framework with robustness and complexity considerations. Design/methodology/approach - The paper defines robustness, complexity, and normalised efficiency of a logistical network. A mathematical model is then constructed based on the conceptual framework and applied to a hypothetical case study with varying robustness requirements. The mathematical model is formulated as an Mixed-Integer Linear Programming problem. Furthermore, the paper introduces a graph-theoretic view of the logistical network and presents its topological properties such as average path length, clustering coefficient, and degree distribution. Findings - The results show that logistical network configurations can be obtained with desirable robustness levels whilst minimising cost. The relationships of robustness versus normalised efficiency and complexity are also presented. The results show that relationships between logistical network topological properties and robustness exist, as in other real world natural and man-made complex networks. Practical implications - Logistical network design is one of the earliest strategic decisions in supply chain management that supply chain managers have to make. Practitioners and researchers typically focus on optimising efficiency and/or responsiveness of logistical networks. It is argued that logistical network designers should also consider robustness and complexity as they are important characteristics of logistical network functionality. The logistical network design frame work successfully incorporates robustness and complexity into design considerations. Originality/value - This paper newly introduces other important performance measures, robustness and complexity, into the logistical network design objective. The design framework is highly relevant and adds value to logistical network designers and managers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This paper presents the product map obtained from data mining results, which investigates the relationships among customer demands, product characteristics, and transaction records, using the Apriori algorithm as a methodology of association rules for data mining. The product map shows that different knowledge patterns and rules can be extracted from customers to develop new cosmetic products and possible marketing solutions.

In consideration of the facts that each node has only a limited ability of information recognition and processing, and the improvement speed of this ability is normally far slower than the growth speed of a network, the local-world size is set limited and unchanged while the network grows. A series of theoretical analysis and numerical simulation are conducted in this paper, the results show that the correlation degrees follow a power-law distribution, and the proposed model can describe the small-world, scale-free, self-similarity and clustering properties for more comprehensive kinds of complex networks than the GM model and other existing local-world network models.

Poor transportation also raises the damages incurred in transit, total inventories, and ordering and overhead costs. Worse, it creates external diseconomies by introducing inefficiencies and unreliability in the supply chain, making it difficult for assemblers to implement lean production. These external diseconomies-rather than excessive freight prices or other direct costs-may be the more debilitating impact of poor transportation infrastructure on industrial performance.

In this paper we aim to explore some characteristics of this expansion from the perspective of the organizational dynamics of global production networks. We found that foreign brand-name companies have played a key role in propelling this wave of investment in the GSA by Taiwanese IT companies. At the same time, their business strategies have influenced the mechanisms governing these Taiwanese companies' supply chains and have forged the dynamics of spatial agglomeration. We argue that the transborder extension of the production networks is interwoven with the exercise of power between enterprise organizations. Our findings suggest that interdependence among firms in close geographical proximity is inseparable from the asymmetrical power relations embodied in global commodity chains; a point emphasized by economic geographers as the main reason for transborder production shifts that result in the formation of new industrial spaces in developing countries. However, if these production networks can respond collectively to such a strict environment through instituting suitable organizational governance, then their competitive advantage will be enhanced, while also benefiting the host region's development through localization. © 2007 a Pion publication printed in Great Britain.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate logistics activities in Singapore hospitals. It defines various types of activities handled by a logistics division. Inventory management policy and the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for logistics purposes are also discussed. The study identifies the nature of strategic alliances in Singapore's health care industry. Design/methodology/approach This study was conducted by utilizing a framework for data collection, pre-testing the questionnaire and conducting interviews. Various relevant literature was reviewed to design the questionnaire. Findings This study finds that logistics division carry out many related activities and some of them also provide engineering services. The hospitals make use of ICT. The hospitals are clustered under various groups to minimize the cost of operation, including the logistics related costs. However, hospitals do not see alliances with suppliers as a strategic option; rather they focus on outsourcing of logistics services. The findings also show that Singapore hospitals have a good stocking policy for both medical and non-medical items so that changes in patient mix can be easily handled. Originality/value Singapore is continuously improving its health care industry and therefore, the findings will help hospitals in other regions to adopt some of the practices, like concentrating on local vendors, outsourcing, clustering, and maximum use of information technology as competitive factors that can improve the service and reduce the cost of operation. The paper suggests motivators and barriers to the use of ICT in logistics in the health care industry. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Moreover, with the complexities of issues such as the role of leadership, the influence of group formation, and analysis of disagreements, it cannot be predictable that there will ever exist a solution to cope with all imprecise, multi-criteria/multi-actor situations. A fuzzy association rules-based approach may be suited for the judgement of human subjects. In this paper, we develop an approach based on Fuzzy Association Rule Mining to support the decision makers by enhancing the flexibility in making decisions for evaluating suppliers with both tangibles and intangibles attributes. Also, by checking the fuzzy classification rules, the goal of knowledge acquisition can be achieved in a framework in which assessments could be established without constraints, and consequently checked and compared in several details. The efficacy and intricacy of the proposed model for finding fuzzy association rules from the database for supplier assessment is demonstrated with the help of numerical examples.},

	abstract = {Inventory management in supply chain networks involves keeping track of hundreds of items spread across multiple locations with complex interrelationships between them. However, it is not computationally feasible to consider each item individually during the decision making process. The use of clusters of items is preferred for the evaluation of these decisions. In addition, the use of groups of items provides management with more effective methods for characterizing and controlling system performance and results in cost savings such as group discounts. In this research, we introduce a comprehensive clustering methodology for supporting inventory management in supply chain networks. All product characteristics which have a significant impact on the performance of the supply chain are taken into account. The nodes in the network are split into subnodes prior to clustering to reduce the complexity. The average linkage clustering algorithm and the Calinski and Harabasz index are used to identify clusters of similar items. In addition, a set of heuristics is used to capture the relationships between items as specified in the bill of materials for the products. Examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the clustering methodology as well as the performance of the heuristics, by comparing the results obtained with the optimal solution.},

This perspective revealed that, by exploiting information gathered directly from their customers at point-of-sale and data mining, supermarkets are able to identify consumer preferences and co-ordinate new product development via innovation networks. This has been made possible through their information control of the supply-chain established through the use of transparent inventory management systems. As a result, supermarkets’ e-business systems have established new competitive processes in the UK food-processing and retailing industry and are an example of consumer-driven innovation networks. The informant-based qualitative approach also revealed that trust-based transacting relationships operated differently from those previously described in the literature. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Mobile agent programming is a paradigm that enables programs to move from one host to another, do the processing locally and return results asynchronously. In this article, mobile computing is implemented by the use of a kernel programming language, Kernel Language for Agent Interaction and Mobility (KLAIM), to coordinate efficiently and streamline the functionality of a supply chain in terms of data transactions. The proposed KLAIM-based approach addresses the issues relating to mobility, integrity, privacy and security, which are a prime concern when operating in an open environment as normally encountered in a supply chain network. The proposed approach is supported by an example case study where an attempt is made to expedite and streamline the information transaction of a supply chain related to an automotive industry.},
