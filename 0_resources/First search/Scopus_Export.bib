abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown the world's economy and trade into disarray, putting international reliance in the limelight. This sparked debate on the durability and resilience of global value chains. In this paper, we construct a ‘product riskiness indicator’ for 4700 globally traded products based on components such as market concentration, clustering tendencies, network centrality of players, or international substitutability to determine which products are vulnerable to trade shocks at the global level – referred to as ‘risky’ products. In a second step, bilateral risky product imports are matched to multi-country input–output tables, allowing for an examination of the importance of globally supplied risky products by country and industry. Due to the high percentage of dangerous products in high-tech product categories, higher-tech industries are more vulnerable to supply-chain vulnerabilities. Third, we analyse the GDP impact of reshoring using a “partial global extraction method.” Assuming that risky product imports from non-EU27 nations are re-shored to EU27 countries, the EU27 GDP might rise by up to 0.5 percent. Non-EU27 countries suffer as a result of such reshoring activity. This implies that ensuring robust or at least resilient supply networks is also in the interest of the supplier countries and sectors. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) launched by the Bank of England could enable businesses to directly make electronic payments. It can be argued that digital payment is helpful in supply chain management applications. However, the adoption of CBDC in the supply chain could bring new turbulence since the CBDC value may fluctuate. Therefore, this paper intends to optimize the production plan of manufacturing supply chain based on a volatility clustering model by reducing CBDC value uncertainty. We apply both GARCH model and machine learning model to depict the CBDC volatility clustering. Empirically, we employed Baltic Dry Index, Bitcoin and exchange rate as main variables with sample period from 2015 to 2021 to evaluate the performance of the two models. On this basis, we reveal that our machine learning model overwhelmingly outperforms the GARCH model. Consequently, our result implies that manufacturing companies’ performance can be strengthened through CBDC uncertainty reduction. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Concurrent floods in multiple locations pose systemic risks to the interconnected economy in East Asia via supply chain disruptions. Despite these significant economic impacts, understanding of the interconnection between rainfall patterns in the region is still currently limited. Here, we analyzed the spatial dependence of the rainfall patterns of 24 megacities in the region using complex analysis theory and discussed the technique's applicability. Each city and rainfall similarity were represented by a node and a link, respectively. Vital-node identification and clustering analysis were conducted using adjacency information entropy and multiresolution community detection. The results of vital-node identification analysis show that high-ranking nodes are cities that are located near main vapor providers in East Asia. Using multiresolution community detection, the groups were clustered to reflect the spatial characteristics of the climate. In addition, the climate links between each group were identified using cross-mutual information considering the delay time for each group. We found a strong bond between Northeast China and the southern Indochinese Peninsula and verified that the links between each group originated from the summer climate characteristics of East Asia. The results of the study show that complex network analysis could be a valuable method for analyzing the spatial relationships between climate factors. © Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={As the world is moving into a sustainable era, achieving zero hunger has become one of the top three Sustainable Development Goals, applying a considerable amount of pressure on the agri-food systems to make decisions contemplating the sustainability dimensions. Accordingly, making effective supply chain decisions holistically while achieving sustainability goals has become a major challenge faced by the present agri-food systems. Thus, to address the challenge, a novel supply chain configuration addressing multiple supply chain decisions to reduce global warming potential (GWP) and post-harvest losses have been presented by taking the banana supply chain in Sri Lanka as a case study. In the proposed approach, farmers have been clustered based on their geo positions using K-Means clustering followed by route planning within clusters using a heuristics approach. Retailer points are catered by assigning to wholesalers optimally modeling as an assignment model and then route planning executed using a heuristic approach. The solution generated from the above approaches has been implemented on a simulation platform to calculate the overall supply chain performance including the transportation component, in terms of the net GWP, post-harvest losses, and lead time including routing operations. Simulated supply chain performance has been compared with the existing system and verified the performance of the proposed supply chain configuration. The suggested configuration has reduced the net GWP by 15.3%, post-harvest loss by 2.1%, lead time by 28.2%, and travel distance by 20.47%. The proposed configuration can be further improved by adding dynamic characteristics to the model. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Over the last decade, supply chain finance (SCF) has gained popularity and increasing attention among academicians and stakeholders in the context of financial flows in the supply chain. However, some research gaps still exist that need to be explored to improve the sustainability of supply chains. Specifically, there is a critical research need to look at the conceptual background of SCF and its potential applicability in various phases of supply chains. Therefore, this article aims to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive State-of-the-Art literature review based on 367 papers published from 2006 to 2020. Furthermore, this article is one of the first attempts to present current and past studies in the domain of SCF in a holistic manner. The analysis highlights the most influential authors, keywords, organisations, leading publications and clusters in existing research areas. This article also sets out a proposed research framework based on the triangulation approach perspective, that is, financial perspective, buyer perspective and supply chain-oriented perspective. The most important and unique contribution of the article is the identification of new and emerging research areas where the application of SCF is still in the nascent stage. These findings can guide stakeholders at every stage of the value chain to appropriately use techniques that model policies to better inform investment and operational decisions in line with Sustainable Development Goals. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26 held in 2021 concluded a global effort to hasten the energy transition toward a net-zero emission industry. As such, green initiatives, which transition the conventional oil and gas (O&G) sector towards a circular economy (CE) are necessary. In this work, the integration of waste oil re-refining technology is proposed as a potential strategy to enhance the circularity of the O&G industry. A two-step sequential model, which incorporates multiple systematic analytical tools (e.g., multi-objective decision analysis, information entropy, geospatial information, clustering, and routing analysis) is developed to determine: (i) optimal waste oil re-refinery technologies, and (ii) optimal supply chain design, which addresses the location for setting up the process facilities and the delivery routes, with the consideration of both economic and environmental performances. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through a case study in Malaysia (that covers both East and West Malaysia). The analysis showed that the proposed strategy is capable of improving economic and environmental performances by about 9.59% and 46.55%, respectively. This work is essentially a useful reference for decision-makers and policymakers in making nationwide transition planning in the O&G sector. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Driven by the growing concern regarding greenhouse gas emissions, in this work, we provide a robust stochastic model for the design of a cooperative supply chain (SC) under uncertainty in CO2 allowance prices from the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). During the last years, CO2 allowance prices have undergone unexpected changes, having strong impact on the design and management of optimal SC. The consideration of uncertainty in the allowance prices has therefore become more important. We use an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict future allowance prices. A full discretization of the underlying probability space leads to a number of scenarios far too large to be handled, so we compare two approaches to reduce the number of scenarios to a feasible maximum, the ScenRed algorithm and K-means clustering. The obtained results are compared with a deterministic approach that is widely studied in the literature, showing an increase in the benefits and a reduction of emissions. © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Supply chains have received significant attention in recent years. Neural networks (NN) are a technique available in artificial intelligence (AI) which has many supporters due to their diverse applications because they can be used to move towards complete harmony. NN, an emerging AI technique, have a strong appeal for a wide range of applications to overcome many issues associated with supply chains. This study aims to provide a comprehensive view of NN applications in supply chain management (SCM), working as a reference for future research directions for SCM researchers and application insight for SCM practitioners. This study generally introduces NNs and has explained the use of this method in five features identified by supply chain area, including optimization, forecasting, modeling and simulation, clustering, decision support, and the possibility of using NNs in supply chain management. The results showed that NN applications in SCM were still in a developmental stage since there were not enough high-yielding authors to form a strong group force in the research of NN applications in SCM. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Industry 4.0 technologies are causing a paradigm shift in supply chain process management. The digital transformation of the supply chains provides enormous benefits to organizations by empowering collaboration among multiple internal and external organizations and systems. This study presents a narrative review explaining the existing knowledge on digital transformation in supply chain process management using text mining. It summarizes the existing literature to explain the current state of the art in supply chain digitalization. This comprehensive review identifies the most important topics and technologies and determines the future trends in this emerging field. We investigate the articles published in Web of Science and Scopus databases and use text mining techniques (clustering and topic modeling) on the article contents. Using VOS viewer, a bibliometric analysis of 395 articles with 12,700 references is analyzed. The contents of the articles are explored using text mining approaches. The synthesized results reveal that the most important topics in digital transformation are “sustainable supply chain management” and “circular economy and industry 4.0 technologies”. The study further discovers big data, data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things as the most critical technologies for facilitating supply chain digital transformation. Finally, an overlay heatmap analysis of the research articles found that digital transformation, supply chain management, industry 4.0, decision-making, and sustainability are emerging trends in supply chain digitalization. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Consumer demand for organic products, rapidly growing urbanizations levels requires the food supply chain to reduce lead-time and maintain higher product quality. For the food supply chain to cope with the raising issues an e-commerce type of supply chain must be implemented. This approach creates challenges for supply chain, because the food industry must shift towards high variety and low quantity freight forwarding with multiple delivery points. The methodology of the paper consists of scientific literature analysis and macro indicator clustering. The author of the paper proposes a supply chain management framework, which is grounded through complexity theory. The framework mainly consists of 3 characteristics, which organizations should operationalize to maintain system resilience and which in the long-run would evolve to sustainable development–capabilities, collaboration, complexity management. The proposed framework defines how operational and tactical levels should be automated through cyber-physical systems, while the automation should be controlled through strategic level variables. The macro level analysis of existing EU markets of the food industry has been conducted to identify the food industry’s contingencies, in which an agent-based model will be used to validate the proposed framework. Main 3 clusters were identified, which number was chosen based on the elbow method and validated with the silhouette score of 0.749. The food industry can be categorized in to developing, underdeveloped, and developed food industries. Moreover, singularities of different contingencies have been identified which considers population size, population density, market size of the food industry and disruption intensity. The application of the framework depends on the identified contingencies. From strategic level the SCMF is similar in all contingencies, however, depending on the type of market, more emphasize on vehicle routing or demand forecasting should be made. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to study the concept, characteristics and factors of the resilient supply chain (RSC) and develop a hierarchical structural model and classify the factors based on their interrelationships. Design/methodology/approach: This paper has used a mixed-approach of literature review and expert opinion to identify the factors of RSC. For the development of the structural model and clustering of the factors, this paper has used the total interpretive structural modeling approach with Matrice d’Impacts Croises-Multiplication Applique and Classment and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory analysis. Findings: In total, this study has identified 17 factors that enable the 3R capability of the RSC. The result shows that the factors have a close dependence relationship with supply chain (SC) risk management culture as the most influencing factor. Further, this study classifies the factors into enablers and strategies. Research limitations/implications: This research work is the theoretical contribution to the RSC concept and helps the experts to develop and improve the resilient ability in the SC. This research is based entirely on subjective expert feedback; thus, the results are sensitive to the expert’s judgment. Practical implications: This research will help the decision-makers in allocating the resources and policies to develop or improve the SC capabilities. Originality/value: This research work is the first kind of research in the field of the RSC that considers the 3R concept to identify and model the resilient factors of the SC. Along with the theoretical concept, this research provides empirical evidence for the importance ranking of the factors. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={In the past years, research in Social Network Analysis (SNA) has increased. Initially, the research area was limited to sociology and anthropology but has now been used in numerous disciplines. The business and management discipline has many potentials in employing the SNA approach due to enormous relational data, ranging from employees, stakeholders to organisations. The study aims to analyse the research trend, performance, and the utilisation of the SNA approach in business and management research. Bibliometric analysis was conducted by employing 2,158 research data from the Scopus database published from 2001 to 2020. Next, the research quantity and quality were calculated using Harzing's Publish or Perish while VOSviewer visualised research topics and cluster analysis. The study found an upward trend pattern in SNA research since 2005 and reached the peak in 2020. Generally, six subjects under the business and management discipline have used SNA as a methodology tool, including risk management, project management, supply chain management (SCM), tourism, technology and innovation management, and knowledge management. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the study is the first to examine the performance and analysis of SNA in the overall business and management disciplines. The findings provide insight to researchers, academicians, consultants, and other stakeholders on the practical use of SNA in business and management research. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={Purpose: The findings of this paper throw light on the focal research areas within RFID in the supply chain, which serves as an effective guideline for future research in this area. This research, therefore, contributes to filling the gap by carrying out an SLR of contemporary research studies in the area of RFID applications in supply chains. To date, SLR augmented with BA has not been used to study the developments in RFID applications in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: We analyze 556 articles from years 2001 to date using Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Contemporary bibliometric analysis (BA) tools are utilized. First, an exploratory analysis is carried, out revealing influential authors, sources, regions, among other key aspects. Second, a co-citation work analysis is utilized to understand the conceptual structure of the literature, followed by a dynamic co-citation network to reveal the evolution of the field. This is followed by a multivariate analysis is performed on top-100 cited papers, and k-means clustering is carried out to find optimal groups and identify research themes. The influential themes are then pointed out using factor analysis. Findings: An exploratory analysis is carried out using BA tools to provide insights into factors such as influential authors, production countries, top-cited papers and frequent keywords. Visualization of bibliographical data using co-citation network analysis and keyword co-occurrence analysis assisted in understanding the groups (communities) of research themes. We employed k-means clustering and factor analysis methods to further develop these insights. A historiographical direct citation analysis also unveils potential research directions. We observe that RFID applications in the supply chain are likely to benefit from the Internet of Things and blockchain Technology along with the other machine learning and visualization approaches. Originality/value: Although several researchers have researched RFID literature in relation to supply chains, these reviews are often conducted in the traditional manner where the author(s) select paper based on their area of expertise, interest and experience. Limitation of such reviews includes authors’ selection bias of studies to be included and limited or no use of advanced BA tools for analysis. This study fills this research gap by conducting an SLR of RFID in supply chains to identify important research trends in this field through the use of advanced BA tools. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={How to locate the reasonable targets for carbon emission reduction in the complex global supply chain remains a big challenge for policy makers. This paper proposed a novel framework for finding more accurate carbon emission reduction targets, combining multi-regional input-output analysis, complex network approach and an improved susceptible–infective model called the influence spreading model. The results showed that the global embodied carbon emission flow network had the characteristic of being significantly scale-free, and there were a few important industrial sectors in the network with different capabilities, including strength-out, closeness-out, betweenness and clustering coefficient. The simulation results of the influence spreading process showed that the effective infection thresholds were relatively low, which were between 0 and 0.005 due to the significant scale-free characteristic of the global embodied carbon emission flow network. With the change of the infection thresholds, the proportion of the infected sectors significantly decreased from about 0.95 to 0.10 on average, and spread time also decreased from about three rounds to about eight rounds. In the aspects of the spreading scope and spreading speed, the industrial sectors with high closeness-out and betweenness had better performance than the ones with high strength-out. This indicated that the spreading capabilities of industrial sectors which exported significant carbon emissions, such as petroleum, chemicals and non-metallic mineral products in China, were commonly weaker than industrial sectors which occupied the most important positions in the entire supply chain, such as transport equipment in Germany. Hence, the industrial sectors with high global spreading capability and media capability were important for global carbon emission reduction. Such information suggested that the policies for carbon emission reduction should be made based on a global perspective of the supply chain system. This work proved that the policies for carbon emission reduction should be based on a global perspective of supply chain system. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The fluctuation of energy prices has a great impact on the economy, making it essential to analyze the risk transmission among energy commodities. In this paper, we use the minimum spanning tree (MST) approach and connectedness method to study the risk transmission among energy futures in China. Eleven commodities, including two globally traded crude oil, are considered. Four major results are obtained. First, MST analysis provides evidence of industry clustering. Second, the risk transmission is generally from the petrochemical sector to the coal sector; while the risk transmission in each sector mainly spills from upstream to the downstream products. Third, “methanol - polyethylene” bridges the coal sector and petrochemical sector, through which the link between the two sectors has been strengthened since the outbreak of COVID-19. Fourth, the systemic risk of the energy market has increased, and several commodities have experienced a role reversal in the network since the pandemic began, especially in the petrochemical sector. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The chemical industry has growing importance in sustainability because of the potential adverse effects on the environment. Also, stakeholders emphasize many social issues besides environmental protection for the chemical industry. Relying on a solid supplier base has become the main prerequisite for chemical manufacturers to achieve environmental targets and fulfill stakeholders' expectations while remaining competitive. This study develops the Integrated Sustainable Supplier Evaluation & Development Framework (ISSED-F) to support chemical manufacturers with managing supplier relationships according to the economic, environmental, and social facets of sustainability. Although the literature is rife with evaluation models aiming to fulfill the supplier selection tasks, these models mostly ignore the developmental role of supplier evaluation. To remedy this gap, ISSED-F adopts a deductive and holistic approach from setting the criteria to setting the measurement structure, evaluating the suppliers, and developing the suppliers. Materiality analysis, Analytic Network Process (ANP), Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE), and cluster analysis are the fundamental methods that constitute the ISSED-F structure. A case study presents the use of the ISSED-F in a transnational chemical manufacturer's supplier relationship management (SRM) process. The case company evaluates 69 suppliers and assigns development strategies to the relevant performance segments within the implementation. The successful implementation of ISSED-F shows that it can be a roadmap for chemical manufacturers to adopt sustainability practices and ensure continuous development in their supply chains. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The establishment of supply chain innovation enterprises is conducive to maximizing production efficiency, deepening the division of labor mechanism in all links, and promoting supplyside structural reform. In order to study the factors related to the distribution of supply chain innovation enterprises, this study was based on the pilot list of the first and second batches of supply chain innovation enterprises in Zhejiang Province from 2017 to 2019, and based on the geographical location points of 187 enterprises. The POI data were analyzed with the GeoDa 1.20 and ArcMap 10.8 systems, using tools such as the Moran index, nearest neighbor index, point density estimation, standard deviational ellipse, etc. The analysis results show that the distribution characteristics and influencing factors of supply chain innovation enterprises in Zhejiang Province demonstrate global autocorrelation and a high degree of local aggregation, forming a “one main multi-point” distribution with Hangzhou as the center. The influencing factors are mainly affected by employment density and local economy, and there are multi-factor interactions. Finally, this study puts forward suggestions for the improvement of supply chain innovation enterprises, hoping to promote the sustainable development of supply chain innovation enterprises. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Mass customization is an important strategy to improve production systems to satisfy customers' preferences while maintaining production efficiency for mass production. Module production is one of the ways to achieve mass customization, and products are produced by combining modules. In the module production, it becomes much more important for manufacturing companies to reflect customers' preferences for selling products. The manufacturer can increase its total profit by providing customized products that satisfy customers' preferences by increasing customers' satisfaction. In conventional production planning, there are some cases where module production is conducted by the demands from customers' preferences. However, the customer decision-making model has not been employed in the production planning model. In this paper, a production planning model incorporating customers' preferences is developed. The customers' purchasing behavior is generated by using a machine learning model. Customer segmentation is conducted by clustering data that uses the purchase data of multiple customers. The resulting production planning model is a bilevel production planning problem consisting of a single company and multiple customers. Each company can sell products that combine modules that customers require in each segment. We show that the proposed model can obtain higher customers' satisfaction with greater profits than the model that does not employ the customers' purchasing model. © 2022 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract={Supply chain management (SCM) is concerned with the movement of products, services, and information from points of origin to consumers via a network of interconnected organizations and activities. It is believed that capacity, demand, and cost are well-known variables in typical SCM challenges. In practice, however, there are uncertainties brought on by changes in client demand, supply chain management, organizational risks, and lead times. Demand uncertainty in particular has a significant impact on SC performance with wide-ranging implications for scheduling production, planning inventories, and organizing transportation. In this regard, demand forecasting is a crucial strategy for tackling supply chain uncertainty. Forecasting supply chain demand using big data analytics has been published in the supervised and unsupervised learning categories. In supervised learning, the inputs and outputs are known because the data are tagged with labels. Given a fresh unlabeled dataset, the supervised learning algorithms attempt to map the inputs to matching outputs by identifying the underlying connections between the inputs and outputs. The main motive for the authors is to prove that supply chain can be managed through machine learning and to get a novel accuracy along with comparison of the machine learning models. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The routing of commodities is a tactical problem in supply chain management that aims to synchronise transportation services connecting a network of warehouses and consolidation locations. This paper considers the routing of commodities in a transportation network that is flexible in response to demand through changes to regional warehouse clustering and the designation of consolidation locations. Traditionally, warehouse clustering and consolidation locations are determined as part of strategic planning that is performed months to years in advance of operations—limiting the flexibility in transportation networks to respond to changes in demand. A mathematical programming-based algorithmic framework is proposed to integrate the strategic decisions of location planning with tactical decisions of vehicle routing and synchronisation. A multi-armed bandit problem is developed to explore warehouse clustering decisions and exploit those that lead to small transportation costs. An extensive computational study will show that the proposed algorithmic framework effectively integrates strategic and tactical planning decisions to reduce the overall transportation costs. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Blockchain is one of the most anticipated technology revolutions, with immense promise in various applications. It is a distributed and encrypted database that can address a range of challenges connected to online security and trust. While many people identify Blockchain with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, it has a wide range of applications in supply chain management, health, Internet of Things (IoT), education, identity theft prevention, logistics, and the execution of digital smart contracts. Although Blockchain Technology (BT) has numerous advantages for Decentralized Applications (DApps), it is nevertheless vulnerable to abuse, smart contract failures, security, theft, trespassing, and other concerns. As a result, using Machine Learning (ML) models to detect anomalies is an excellent way to detect and safeguard blockchain networks from criminal activity. Adapting ensemble learning methods in ML to create better prediction outcomes is a viable approach for anomaly identification. Ensemble learning, as the name implies, refers to creating a stronger and more accurate classification by combining the prediction results of numerous weak models. As a result, an in-depth evaluation of ensemble learning methodologies for anomaly detection in the blockchain network ecosystem is applied in this paper. It comprises numerous ensemble methods (e.g., averaging, voting, stacking, boosting, bagging). The review collects data from three established databases, which are Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and Google Scholar. Specific keywords are employed, such as Blockchain, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Anomaly Detection, and Ensemble Learning, employing advanced searching algorithms. The results of the search found 60 primary articles from 2017 to 2022 (30 from Scopus, 20 from the WoS, and 10 from Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we decided to divide our debate into three primary themes: (1) the fundamentals of Blockchain Technology (BT), (2) the overview of ensemble learning, and (3) the integration and analysis of ensemble learning in blockchain networks for anomaly detection. In terms of awareness and knowledge, the results are also discussed in terms of what they mean and where future research should go © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.All Rights Reserved},

abstract={The last decades have seen a growing interest in construction management amongst scholars, particularly, in how to apply supply chain management (SCM) strategies to improve logistics efficiency and project performance. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which integrate multiple quantitative methods to synthesise the literature on construction logistics and supply chain management (CLSCM) and analyse their trends during the last two decades. In this work, we concurrently deploy the rigorous six-step SLR protocol together with co-citation analysis, factor analysis, multidimensional scaling-based fuzzy k-means clustering, and keyword extraction and co-occurrence analysis to ascertain and examine clusters of CLSCM application. The results show that there are six established research clusters in CLSCM, namely, logistics and SCM for prefabricated construction, construction procurement, construction supply chain integration, green construction SCM, reverse logistics in construction and onsite construction logistics. Amongst these clusters, construction supply chain integration plays the most integral role. Informed by this ascertained knowledge structure, we explore the research trends during the period reviewed, propose a conceptual framework for CLSCM and suggest research avenues. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Effectively monitoring and controlling product quality is critical in produce supply chain management. Hyperspectral imaging has emerged as a promising technique for monitoring food products, but the size of hyperspectral datasets complicates storage and processing. This work develops a novel architecture for autoencoder models that is well-suited for nonlinear subspace learning on tensorial, hyperspectral data. In particular, separate sub-models are used to (de)compress each mode of the data tensor, preserving spatial locality information and greatly reducing the number of autoencoder parameters. The approach enables memory-efficient training, nonlinear dimensionality reduction, and multi-task learning, as demonstrated by a real-world case study. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Food needs are rising as the world's population grows. Similarly, the food processing industry is growing at an accelerated pace. Reduced food waste, better supply chain management, and increased delivery and storage of food are urgently required. These goals can be achieved to a large part with the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. When a computer software can learn to anticipate future events without being programmed, it is known as machine learning. Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two of the most common subcategories of machine learning. In this post, we'll look at how AI and machine learning are being used in the food and agricultural sector. Supply chain optimization, crop selection, logistics, food delivery, maintenance prediction in food processing machinery, detection of crop disease, smart irrigation, crop yield prediction, tracking of perishable food, soil data analysis, and weather data analysis are all major applications. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent technological developments indicate possible advancements in supply chain management (SCM). These innovations have attracted a lot of interest from industries including logistics, manufacturing, packaging, and transportation. The conventional systems, however, use centralised servers to control all operations, including the exchange of raw materials, making orders, dealing with buyers and sellers, and updating orders. The network's supply chain may thus be insecure as a result of every activity being routed via centralised servers. The danger is additionally increased by a number of difficulties, including scalability, data integrity, security, and availability. Block chain technology may be used in these circumstances to decentralise transaction processing and eliminate the need for a centralised controller. In this approach, the performance of the resource-constrained supply chain network is improved by the effective use of edge computing and priority data access. The Intelligent K-Means (IKM) clustering algorithm is suggested across the edge nodes in the current research to categorise the priority level of each piece of data. This classifier determines if the edge node has received data that is high priority or low priority. Low priority data is recorded in the log files for future data analysis. Then, to allow safe data flow in the open block chain while excluding outside parties, the High Priority Access based Smart Contract (HPASC) technique is deployed. The whole experiment was conducted in a Python environment, and variables including scalability, reaction time, throughput, and accuracy were studied. Current systems' constrained block sizes and fork creation lengthen the time transactions must wait before being processed. The suggested methodology is quicker and uses less storage space than current block chain systems. The results show that the suggested approach works better than current blockchain technology to raise the standard of supply chain management. © 2022 Ali Rizwan et al.},

abstract={The proper selection of a demand forecasting method is directly linked to the success of supply chain management (SCM). However, today's manufacturing companies are confronted with uncertain and dynamic markets. Consequently, classical statistical methods are not always appropriate for accurate and reliable forecasting. Algorithms of Artificial intelligence (AI) are currently used to improve statistical methods. Existing literature only gives a very general overview of the AI methods used in combination with demand forecasting. This paper provides an analysis of the AI methods published in the last five years (2017-2021). Furthermore, a classification is presented by clustering the AI methods in order to define the trend of the methods applied. Finally, a classification of the different AI methods according to the dimensionality of data, volume of data, and time horizon of the forecast is presented. The goal is to support the selection of the appropriate AI method to optimize demand forecasting. © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Supply Chain Planning (SCP) problems can be effectively modeled through the Multiobjectives Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) paradigm. MIP-based “scalarization”techniques (Mixed-Integer Programming) have been successfully exploited for solving SCP optimization problems characterized by numerous conflicting objectives and supply chain-specific constraints. Nevertheless, the planning of complex and large-scale SCP instances remains often a real challenge because of the huge number of decision variables to handle. This chapter presents a new methodology, “Variables Clustering Method”(VCM), that aims at systematic reduction of the number of decision variables required by any SCP model. VCM can be applied to a general SCP paradigm and exploited in several industries sectors enlarging the class of solvable instances. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: This paper presents a bibliometric overview of research published application of social network analysis in supply chain management in recent decades. It may be useful for showing the most important problems in this area. With this aim, Citespace is used to analyse the literature on the application of social network analysis in supply chain management to clarify the development and research trend. Bibliometric analysis is the quantitative study of bibliographic material. It provides a general picture of a research field that can be classified by papers, authors, and journals. The main objective of this study is to investigate the knowledge domain about application social network analysis in the supply chain field and reveal the thematic patterns and topics of high interest to researchers to predict emerging trends in the literature. Methods: To investigate the growth of studies about the applicable social network in supply chain management, 647 articles were reviewed by CiteSpace software. These papers were collected from the Core Collection of Thomson Reuters and published in 16 journals in operations research and management science from 2004 to 2021. Document co-citation analysis, clustering analysis, and citation burst detection were conducted to investigate and examine the thematic patterns, emerging trends, and critical articles of the knowledge domain. Results: Social network approaches are increasingly popular in the supply chain. Four major clusters are discussed in detail, namely multi-objective optimization, sustainable supply chain, supply network, and circular economy. Three research trends of supply chain network design, structural characteristics, and supplier selection and evaluation were identified based on citation bursts analysis. Conclusions: The present study offers a new approach to visualizing relevant data to synthesize scientific research findings of the application of social network analysis in supply chain management. Additionally, directions for future research in this area are presented. © Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska.},

The strategic management level needs easy access of valuable insights from such varying and rapidly changing data, which ranges from daily transactions on customer interactions and social network. These values can be extracted using different data mining methods like association rule mining and cluster analysis. This value is provided with big data analytics, which is represented as an application of advanced analytics techniques of big data. The end point use of such finding is supply chain management, risk management fields of different domains. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={This study focuses on management ways within a city multi-floor manufacturing cluster (MFMC). The application of MFMC in megapolises is closely related to the problem of urban spatial development and the problem of matching transport and logistics services. The operation of the MFMC depends on the efficiency of production and transport management considering technical, economic, end environmental factors. Therefore, conditions affecting decision-making in the field of production planning by MFMCs and accompanying transports within the agglomeration area with the use of the production-service platform were presented. Assumptions were created for the decision model, allowing for the selection of partners within the MFMC to execute the production order. A simplified decision model using the Hungarian algorithm was proposed, which was verified with the use of test data. The model is universal for material flow analysis and is an assessments basis for smart sustainable supply chain decision-making and planning. Despite the narrowing of the scope of the analysis and the simplifications applied, the presented model using the Hungarian algorithm demonstrated its potential to solve the problem of partner selection for the execution of the contract by MFMC. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Economies are transitioning from a linear to a circular model to address global issues such as resource extraction, environmental degradation and waste generation. Cross-Sector Collaboration (C-SC) is an effective means to use resources in a way that is mutually beneficial and integrates sustainable practices into the value chain. The zero-waste aspiration of companies can be achieved through Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM). Existing literature supports research initiatives in CSCM, but how C-SC influences CSCM is still unexplored. Moreover, the barriers to C-SC for CSCM are untouched and the strategies to overcome these barriers are unmapped. This study fills this gap, assesses the barriers to C-SC for CSCM and suggests a strategic roadmap to overcome these barriers. The study was conducted in three different phases employing a multi-method approach of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC), Fuzzy Delphi and Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL). The results reveal that governance barriers and contextual barriers are causal and influence the other barriers. There is a need to enhance the capacity and optimum resource utilisation for developing circular supply chains; it is possible to facilitate CSCM practices only through collaborative efforts across sectors. The study also highlights that government policymaking and regulation, collaborative value capture model and Industry 4.0 technologies are the most effective strategies for managing C-SC for CSCM. This study contributes to stakeholder theory and resource-based view theory by explicating collaboration among cross-sector stakeholders and highlighting the significance of resource optimisation through waste management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Sustainable supply chain (SSC) is an emerging research area that focuses on the triple bottom line pertaining to all stakeholders and related activities. Important Business decisions relevant processes, and activities are focused on features in SSC articles. Using the bibliometric techniques, the author attempted to analyze the research area's impact, its associated eminent authors, along with their affiliated institutions and countries. Through conducting network analysis in VOSviewer software and Gephi software researchers focus on co-authorship, author specified keywords clustering, and countries-based bibliographic analysis. The research identifies the most influential research work/authors in the defined duration. Using network analysis, authors can identify knowledge groups their affiliations, and future research opportunities. In contrast to the existing literature, the author here used keywords occurrence as a criterion for clustering. The identified clusters define the research themes and keyword occurrence helps in identifying future research implications. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Despite the long-recognised importance of data-driven operations and supply chain management (OSCM) scholarship and practice, and the impressive development of big data analytics (BDA), research finds that firms struggle with BDA adoption, which suggests the existence of gaps in the literature. Therefore, we conduct this systematic literature review of journal articles on data-driven OSCM from 2000 to early 2020 to ascertain established research clusters and literature lacunae. Using co-citation analysis software and double-checking the results with factor analysis and multidimensional-scaling-based k-means clustering, we find six clusters of studies on data-driven OSCM, whose primary topics are identified by keyword co-occurrence analysis. Five of these clusters relate directly to manufacturing, which, in line with the existing literature, indicates the crucial role of production in OSCM. We highlight the evolution of these research clusters and propose how the literature on data-driven OSCM can support BDA in OSCM. We synthesise what has been studied in the literature as points of reference for practitioners and researchers and identify what necessitates further exploration. In addition to the insights contributed to the literature, our study is amongst the first efforts to deploy multiple clustering techniques to undertake a rigorous data-driven systematic literature review (SLR) of data-driven OSCM. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brings about severe disruptions for human living, economics, and environmental balance. This pandemic has boosted the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and thus, medical wastes. Thus, a research hypothesis is stated whether it would be possible to provide more efficient distribution and inventory planning to optimize the PPE availability in a fuzzy environment. To confirm the hypothesis, in addition to addressing a scientific novelty considering integration of linear programming with fuzzy parameters, named as the Jimenez’s method and clustering heuristic methods, the practicality of these approaches is provided on a real case study and generated instances from Turkey. The computational results reveal that clustering the 32% of the hospitals ensures optimum total cost and solution time while feasibility degree changes between 0, 4, and 1 values of the Jimenez are not more effective on the results. Improved cost results reveal the economic importance of the healthcare supply chain management and optimal PPE distribution and inventory planning can break down the disease propagation and reduce the detrimental impacts on human life. The proposed approach, for the first time, ensures practical and theoretical insights of distribution and storage decisions across disciplines, namely, engineering and health-care organization authorities. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Transportation management, as a part of the supply chain management, is a complex process that consists of planning and delivering goods to customers. The paper presents a complete multi-phase intelligent and adaptive transportation management system, which includes data collection, parameter tuning, and the heuristic algorithm based on the Tabu search for vehicle routing. The paper describes the procedure for collecting Global Positioning System (GPS) data and analyzing the compliance with the proposed routes based on the data collected. The described routing algorithm is powerful and supports many real-world limitations. An algorithm for the anomaly detection in the GPS data is presented as well as the usage of collected GPS data to improve the future results of the algorithm. The concept was implemented and tested on real data in some of the largest distribution companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The proposed approach resulted with more than satisfactory results in real-world application. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={While addressing supply chain planning under uncertainty, Robust Optimization (RO) is regarded as an efficient and tractable method. As RO involves calculation of several statistical moments or maximum / minimum values involving the objective functions under realizations of these uncertain parameters, the accuracy of this method significantly depends on the efficient techniques to sample the uncertainty parameter space with limited amount of data. Conventional sampling techniques, e.g. box/budget/ellipsoidal, work by sampling the uncertain parameter space inefficiently, often leading to inaccuracies in such estimations. This paper proposes a methodology to amalgamate machine learning and data analytics with RO, thereby making it data-driven. A novel neuro fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to cluster the uncertain space such that the exact regions of uncertainty are optimally identified. Subsequently, local density based boundary point detection and Delaunay triangulation based boundary construction enable intelligent Sobol based sampling to sample the uncertain parameter space more accurately. The proposed technique is utilized to explore the merits of RO towards addressing the uncertainty issues of product demand, machine uptime and production cost associated with a multiproduct, and multisite supply chain planning model. The uncertainty in supply chain model is thoroughly analysed by carefully constructing examples and its case studies leading to large scale mixed integer linear and nonlinear programming problems which were efficiently solved in GAMS® framework. Demonstration of efficacy of the proposed method over the box, budget and ellipsoidal sampling method through comprehensive analysis adds to other highlights of the current work. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={When dealing with Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (ASRS), the allocation of items to the most convenient storage location depends on the vast amount of data produced internally (e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning, Manufacturing Enterprise Systems) and externally (e.g. Supply Chain Management). Moreover, a proper item allocation in the warehouse has a strong influence on the warehouse saturation levels and picking times. In this perspective, the present work proposes the application of data-driven algorithms for managing items in an Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) in order to reduce the picking times and storage space. Specifically, a four-layer framework is adopted for collecting data produced by different information sources and analyzing them through a data-driven approach. The analytics layer is performed by combining the Association Rule Mining (ARM) technique, to investigate the network of influences among data collected, and a simulation approach for assessing the feasibility of the proposed implementation. The Association Rule Mining allows company managers to identify the components that should be located on the same tray in the ASRS, defining the couples of items frequently picked together in order to reduce the total picking time. The proposed approach is applied to the case study of a shoe manufacturing company to explain the research approach and show how the implementation of the data-driven methodology can provide valuable support in defining item allocation and picking rules. The proposed Association Rule Mining method is new in this context and it has shown a positive impact in comparison to traditional solutions of warehouse management, providing a complete overview of the items’ interactions and identifying communities of items that define local and global patterns and locate influential entities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Multi-depot capacitated vehicle routing problem is a derivative of vehicle routing problem and a well-known area that has been studied widely with various applications and constraints. Many studies in it focused on minimizing cost and distance with assumption that all nodes are visited. Ironically, number of unserved customers (nodes) in a single trip was rarely explored and often ignored. Based on this problem, this work aims to minimize the total travel distance and the number of unserved customers in single routing cycle. The solution is developed by combining the stable marriage algorithm and k-means clustering in the clustering process. The nearest neighbour algorithm is used in the routing process. This work proposes two contributions. The first is the usage of the stable marriage and k-means clustering. The second is concerning the predetermined distribution of the vehicles in the solution to reduce the number of unserved customers. In the simulation, this proposed model is compared with the hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA), partition-based algorithm-nearest neighbour algorithm (PBA-NN), genetic algorithm-nearest neighbour algorithm (GA-NN) and simulated annealing algorithm (SA). Based on the simulation result, it is found that the proposed model performs moderately as a trade-off between the SA and PBA-NN. In the number of unserved customers aspect, when the number of customers is low, the proposed model creates 71 percent lower than the PBA-NN model. Meanwhile, when the number of customers is high, the proposed model creates 73 percent lower than the PBA-NN model. In the total travel distance aspect, when the number of customers is low (50 persons), the proposed model creates 63 percent higher than the GA-NN model and 48 percent lower than the SA model. Meanwhile, when the number of customers is high (100 customers), the proposed model creates 52 percent higher than the PBA-NN model and 54 percent lower than the SA model. © 2021, International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.

abstract={In modern systems, there is a tendency to model issues more accurately with low computational cost and considering multiscale decision-making which increases the complexity of the optimization. Therefore, it is necessary to develop tools to cope with these new challenges. Supply chain management of enterprise-wide operations usually involves three decision levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. These decision levels depend on each other involving different time scales. Accordingly, their integration usually leads to multiscale models that are computationally intractable. In this work, the aim is to develop novel clustering methods with multiple attributes to tackle the integrated problem. As a result, a clustering structure is proposed in the form of a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) later converted into a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for clustering shape-based time series data with multiple attributes through a multi-objective optimization approach (since different attributes have different scales or units) and minimize the computational complexity of multiscale decision problems. The results show that normal clustering is closer to the optimal case (full-scale model) compared with sequence clustering. Additionally, it provides improved solution quality due to flexibility in terms of sequence restrictions. The developed clustering algorithms can work with any two-dimensional datasets and simultaneous demand patterns. The most suitable applications of the clustering algorithms are long-term planning and integrated scheduling and planning problems. To show the performance of the proposed method, it is investigated on an energy hub as a case study, the results show a significant reduction in computational cost with accuracies ranging from 95.8% to 98.3%. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper studies the application of fuzzy clustering algorithm in E-SCM data mining. EC is a brand-new business model, and supply chain management is a fundamentally different management model from traditional vertical integration management. The combination of the two is the need for enterprises to cope with fierce competition, enhance their competitiveness and improve their profitability in the new market environment.

abstract={The study collected papers on radio frequency identification (RFID) applications from an academic database to explore the topic’s development trajectory and predict future development trends. Overall, 3820 papers were collected, and citation networks were established on the basis of the literature references. Main path analysis was performed on the networks to determine the development trajectory of RFID applications. After clustering into groups, the results are twenty clusters, and six clusters with citation counts of more than 200 were obtained. Cluster and word cloud analyses were conducted, and the main research themes were identified: RFID applications in supply chain management, antenna design, collision prevention protocols, privacy and safety, tag sensors, and localization systems. Text mining was performed on the titles and abstracts of the papers to identify frequent keywords and topics of interest to researchers. Finally, statistical analysis of papers published in the previous 4 years revealed RFID applications in construction, aquaculture, and experimentation are less frequently discussed themes. This study provides planning directions for industry, and the findings serve as a reference for business domain. The integrated analysis successfully determined the trajectory of RFID-based technological development and applications as well as forecast the direction of future research. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Off-site construction (OSC) is an innovative and sustainable construction method. One of its critical success factors is the proper management of its supply chain (SC). Recently, significant research attention has been focused on the modelling of OSC-SC to improve its performance and sustainability. However, the literature still lacks a comprehensive review of the modelling studies on off-site construction -supply chain management (OSC-SCM). Therefore, this research contributes by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date mapping and clustering of 309 journal articles on the modelling of OSC-SC to identify its trends and gaps, and hence, highlight future research opportunities. To achieve these objectives, a mixed review method, consisting of scientometric and systematic reviews, is used. The scientometric review identifies the most prolific journals, researchers, co-occurrence network of keywords, and their citation bursts. On the other hand, the systematic review classifies the articles based on OSC type and supply chain (SC) stage. At each SC stage, the articles are further classified based on problem settings and solution methods. The results show that production problems have received the most attention (i.e., by 28% of the included articles), followed by on-site construction (19%), design (13%), and logistics (7%) problems. However, researchers are more inclined to address problems at multiple SC stages (33%) due to the interrelationship between these stages. Besides, the systematic analysis shows that OSC-SC problems have been solved frequently by a variety of solution methods such as optimization (25%), simulation (13%) and building information modelling (BIM) (9.5%). However, researchers tend more to integrate multiple solution methods (35%) to address the complexities of OSC-SC problems. Finally, the included studies are classified based on the three sustainability dimensions. The results show that economic, environmental, and social sustainability dimensions have been considered in previous studies by 72%, 24%, and 4%, respectively. Therefore, the study identifies research gaps at each SC stage of each OSC type to incentivize future studies to consider more environmental and social sustainability factors in OSC-SC models. Since modular integrated construction (MiC) has the highest prefabrication level, this study provides future research directions for sustainable supply chain management (SCM) in MiC.

abstract={Application of the data mining and fuzzy location estimation in supply chain management system is studied in this research. When locating the communication system fault accurately, in order to be able to quickly locate the system obstacles, the technicians should clarify the true demands of the locating work, and improve work efficiency in this way. With the reference to this technique novelty, this paper designed the novel fuzzy clustering model combined with the neural networks to construct the intelligent supply chain management system. The real data is tested on the different scenarios. The experiment results compared with the latest approaches have proven that the designed framework can effectively analyze the information. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The primary goal of this article is to identify the research fronts on the application of data-driven methods in business and economics. For this purpose, the research literature of the business and economic sciences Subject Categories from the Web of Science is mapped using BibExcel and VOSviewer. Since the assignment to subject categories is done at the journal level and since a journal is often assigned to several subject categories in Web of Science, two mappings are performed: one without considering multiple assignments (broad view) and one considering only those (articles from) journals that have been assigned exclusively to the business and economic sciences subject categories and no others (narrow view). A further aim of this article is therefore to identify differences in the two mappings. Surprisingly, engineering sciences play a major role in the broad mapping, in addition to the economic sciences. In the narrow mapping, however, only the following clusters with a clear business-management focus emerge: (i) Data-driven methods in management in general and data-driven supply chain management in particular, (ii) Data-driven operations research analyses with different business administration/management focuses, (iii) Data-driven methods and processes in economics and finance, and (iv) Data-driven methods in Information Systems. One limitation of the narrow mapping is that many relevant documents are not covered since the journals in which they appear are assigned to multiple subject categories in WoS. The paper comes to the conclusion that the multiple assignments of subject categories in Web of Science may lead to massive changes in the results. Adjacent subject areas—in this specific case the application of data-driven methods in engineering and more mathematically oriented contributions in economics (econometrics) are considered in the broad mapping (not excluding subject categories from neighbouring disciplines) and are even over-represented compared to the core areas of business and economics. If a mapping should only consider the core aspects of particular research fields, it is shown in this use case that the exclusion of Web of Science-subject categories that do not belong to the core areas due to multiple assignments (narrow view), may be a valuable alternative. Finally, it depends on the reader to decide which mapping is more beneficial to them. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={The management of supply chains is becoming more important in economic and social environments. Currently, the social sustainability is a factor that must be considered to design governmental strategies and policies. The objective of this research paper was to show, with a case study an approach to optimize distribution and delivery logistics of food in a social assistance program of school breakfast using mathematical models that include transportation distance, optimal locations, and vehicle routing through different clusters. By using qualitative variables like poverty levels, food insecurity and social exclusion, different clustering methods are proposed with the purpose of identifying the common characteristics in the studied population; and at the same time, reducing the distribution complexity. The results show an efficient approach to design a supply chain that includes economic and social factors. The new model developed in this paper can be used to plan social assistance governmental programs, to identify the specific needs and characteristics of the beneficiaries, minimizing the total cost of the distribution network logistics when delivering food for school meals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The considerations of global sustainability have dramatically increased the importance of the remanufacturing process. Many scholars have started focusing on this vital area from both a management and an engineering point of view. Previous studies have aimed to categorize this area using traditional review approaches, using a smaller body of literature and mostly focusing on the managerial aspects of remanufacturing. Our paper is the only study for which tech-mining and scientometric methods are used to examine remanufacturing research, for the purpose of identifying top actors and key trends with regard to business and technological approaches. We combine both management- and engineering-related studies in this scientometric study. The results shed light on the principal actors, nations, organizations, and scientific domains in this field. Remanufacturing research is categorized using the co-occurrence-based clustering method. This paper identifies four broad research clusters: production planning and control of remanufacturing, material and remanufacturing engineering, supply chain management of remanufacturing process, and remanufacturing applications and new trends. This paper offers benefits to numerous parties: policymakers in the remanufacturing field, academics who wish to see the research domains, and those practitioners interested in the key management, processes, and technologies of remanufacturing activities. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Industries have to integrate environmental, social, and economic aspects into their supply chain management to achieve sustainability. Hence, the industry needs to take appropriate actions in choosing the right suppliers. The aim of this study is to develop a framework for selecting sustainable suppliers by integrating quality management tools using the Kano model, Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process, and Decision Matrix Method. To identify the critical sustainability criteria, the Kano model by the clustering the criteria for sustainable selection supplier was used. We then used the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process to determine the weight of each criterion and applied the Decision Matrix Method to select the most sustainable supplier. Afterward, the appropriate proposed framework was implemented in one of the palm oil industries in Indonesia to validate that the framework is applicable and useful. The study shows that the environmental dimension is the most sustainable supplier criteria followed by economy and social dimension. Quality, pollution control, and information disclosures were found to be important sub-dimensions for sustainable supplier selection. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={In large urban agglomerations, various logistical problems arise due to high population density and deficient transport infrastructure. City logistics involves the efficient distribution of freight transport in urban areas and approaches to mitigate environmental impacts and traffic congestion. This paper aims to use a two-step cluster analytic approach to segmentation of EU27 capital cities based on their city logistics performance. To obtain primary outcomes, the log-likelihood measure in SPSS Statistics was used. The results can be used to identify the development and implementation of logistics measures in capitals across the EU. In addition to clustering, the statistical analysis evaluates the position of investigated cities concerning traffic congestions, and from an environmental point of view, the carbon dioxide produced from transport. The scrutiny delivers practical outlooks on how clustering can be undertaken and proves how the clusters can be used to plan city logistics and supply chain management. Finally, the paper deals with smart city indices from the perspective of sustainable mobility and examines its correlation with city logistics. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The willingness to invest in Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) seems not to depend on supply nor demand of technological innovations. The required sensing and communication technologies have already matured and became affordable for most organizations. Businesses on the other hand require more operational data to address the dynamic and stochastic nature of supply chains. So why should we wait for the actual implementation of tracking and monitoring devices within the supply chain itself? This paper provides an objective overview of state-of-the-art IoT developments in today's supply chain and logistics research. The main aim is to find examples of academic literature that explain how organizations can incorporate real-time data of physically operating objects into their decision making. A systematic literature review is conducted to gain insight into the IoT's analytical capabilities, resulting into a list of 79 cross-disciplinary publications. Most researchers integrate the newly developed measuring devices with more traditional ICT infrastructures to either visualize the current way of operating, or to better predict the system's future state. The resulting health/condition monitoring systems seem to benefit production environments in terms of dependability and quality, while logistics operations are becoming more flexible and faster due to the stronger emphasis on prescriptive analytics (e.g., association and clustering). Further research should extend the IoT's perception layer with more context-aware devices to promote autonomous decision making, invest in wireless communication networks to stimulate distributed data processing, bridge the gap in between predictive and prescriptive analytics by enriching the spectrum of pattern recognition models used, and validate the benefits of the monitoring systems developed. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Making appropriate decisions is indeed a key factor to help companies facing challenges from supply chains nowadays. In this paper, we propose two data-driven approaches that allow making better decisions in supply chain management. In particular, we suggest a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network-based method for forecasting multivariate time series data and an LSTM Autoencoder network-based method combined with a one-class support vector machine algorithm for detecting anomalies in sales. Unlike other approaches, we recommend combining external and internal company data sources for the purpose of enhancing the performance of forecasting algorithms using multivariate LSTM with the optimal hyperparameters. In addition, we also propose a method to optimize hyperparameters for hybrid algorithms for detecting anomalies in time series data. The proposed approaches will be applied to both benchmarking datasets and real data in fashion retail. The obtained results show that the LSTM Autoencoder based method leads to better performance for anomaly detection compared to the LSTM based method suggested in a previous study. The proposed forecasting method for multivariate time series data also performs better than some other methods based on a dataset provided by NASA. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With the continuous improvement of residents' living conditions and the improvement of spiritual civilization construction, urban livability has become the focus of attention of the government and urban residents, as well as a hot topic of research by experts and scholars at home and abroad. How to choose a suitable city to live in has become a group decision-making (GDM) problem that we have to deal with. However, the changeable decision environment leads to the fact that the decision information of the above GDM problem cannot be expressed by traditional display values. Therefore, we choose the probabilistic hesitation fuzzy linguistic term set (PHFLTS) and then study the consensus among preference relations (PRs). This paper will study the group consensus model based on PHFLTS. At present, it has been studied in supply chain management, public opinion prediction and other fields. This paper first defines the concept of PHFLTS and distance measure, then defines the similarity measure and the consistency index (CI) based on the distance measure, constructs the group consensus level (GCI), can express the uncertain preference information given by the decision maker more comprehensively.

abstract={Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the supply chain has become an increasingly pop-ular research topic, but there are little researches on developing countries or emerging market economies as the research object, let alone providing a framework for assessing CSR in sustainable supply chains in the context of these countries. This paper will make up for these literature gaps. From the perspective of the green supply chain management, this paper integrates various authoritative standards and adopts two methods, “R clustering” and “variation coefficient analysis”, to establish a CSR performance evaluation system of China’s transportation industry. Applying the mean square error index weighting method analyzes the performance of 74 companies in China’s transportation industry in 2018 to verify the rationality of the evaluation system. The results find that this industry generally scores low and the performance of responsibilities of different sub‐sectors in this industry is different, but the overall performance trend is improving. This research has impli-cations for China’s transportation industry to improve CSR levels from the perspective of green supply chain management, for managers and stakeholders who are committed to improving China’s CSR green and sustainable development, and for the development of CSR in developing countries and emerging markets. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Assessing the relationship between supply chain performance and organizational culture can help to predict scenarios and improve decision-making. However, this relationship is rarely explored due to the complexity of quantitatively addressing its natural subjectivity. Although soft computing techniques would have the potential to overcome this limitation, they have been rarely applied to this context. This paper aims to introduce a decision model to analyze and quantify the causal relationship between organizational culture and supply chain performance based on the combination of fuzzy grey cognitive maps, grey clustering and multiple fuzzy inference systems. Such model is novel in the literature and can provide new theoretical and practical perspectives. The development of this study is based on the SCOR® (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model attributes (SCC, 2017) and Hofstede's (2001) organizational practices, following the quantitative axiomatic prescriptive model-based research. The main contribution is the introduction of a decision-making model that promotes the alignment between organizational culture and supply chain management, internalizing culture as a driver for performance improvement efforts. By conducting two real application cases in companies from different industrial sectors, results show that the model is able to identify crucial elements regarding cultural profile and performance for both organizations, aiding prioritization, anticipation and enabling the development of guidelines for action plans. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This study represents an integrated approach consisting of AHP (analytical hierarchy process) and TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) in Pythagorean fuzzy environment to solve multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems with completely unknown weights of criteria. Pythagorean fuzzy numbers are used to capture uncertainties associated with decision makers’ ambiguous judgment for the selection of transportation companies in an MCDM context which can also be considered as an important area of supply chain management. In the proposed approach, a new distance measure based on cross-evaluation of Pythagorean fuzzy sets is introduced to overcome the disadvantages of existing distance measures. Unlike existing MCDM approaches, in which either subjective or objective weights of criteria are used, in this method AHP is modified using Pythagorean fuzzy information to calculate subjective weights of criteria, as well as Pythagorean fuzzy entropy weight model is applied to compute objective weights of criteria. Finally, both the weights of criteria are simultaneously taken into consideration to obtain final ranking of the alternatives. To demonstrate the application potentiality of the proposed method, a numerical example is considered with Pythagorean fuzzy input in the context of selecting the best transportation company which is one of the most important parts of transportation management. Further, a comparative analysis is executed with other existing techniques to establish the efficacy of the proposed methodology. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Recommender system is a computer-based intelligent technique which facilitates the customers to fulfill their purchase requirements. In addition to this, it also helps retailers to manage the supply chain of their business and to develop different business strategies keeping in pace with the current market. Supply chain management (SCM) involves the streamlining of a business’s supply-side activities to remain competitive in the business landscape. Maximizing the customer value is another important activity of SCM to gain an advantage in the market. In this work, the K-Means clustering algorithm has been used for the effective segmentation of customers who have bought apparel items. PCA has been used for dimensionality reduction of different features of products and customers. The main focus of this work is to determine the different possible associations of customers in terms of brand, product, and price from their purchase habits. The result shows that the clusters made by the algorithm based on PCA and K-Means are similar and the results are acceptable on the basis of feedback received from existing customers and satisfies the customers’ requirements based on the amount of money (price range) the customers want to spend while doing online shopping. The features of products purchased by customers were combined together to generate a unique product key for business, and a model was prepared to segment products based on the volume of products sold and revenue generated, and the price of products sold and revenue generated. This work, in the long run, will help business houses to build a sustainable, profitable, and scalable e-commerce business. Environmental, social, and economic aspects are important to make e-commerce more sustainable for the benefit of the society. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The advantages of logistics centers for companies, cities, and countries have been discussed in the literature and generally mathematical model-based evaluations besides multi-criteria approaches are proposed for site selection processes. However, since mathematical modeling of multiple site selection often turns out to be NP-hard problem structure, it is not always possible to obtain an optimal solution by the solvers. For this reason, various meta-heuristic approaches have emerged to solve these complex models. In this context, the aim of this study is to propose an integrated methodology which seeks an optimum result efficiently regarding a logistics center location selection problem. Thus, the optimal clustering of logistics mobility in a metropolitan area was carried out with GIS and a meta-heuristic approach. GIS produced the spatial information needed by p-median model, then the meta-heuristic approach determined the optimal result that considers the logistics costs. BPSO algorithm has employed as the meta-heuristic and it is observed that the algorithm can reach the optimum results within superior times for the problem sizes tested where binary integer programming verified the optimums and the algorithm continued to reach improved solutions where the exact algorithms failed for larger instances. The integrated solution methodology is applied to a large metropolitan region and it is found that it can be used properly by the urban city planners and supply chain managers to analyze critical nodes of transportation networks of megacities. © 2020 World Conference on Transport Research Society},

abstract={Planning for optimized farming with the aim of providing ideal site and cultivar selection is critical for a stable and sustainable supply of rice with sufficient quantity and quality to customers. In this study, a range of morphological characteristics and yield of eight rice cultivars that are commonly cultivated in Korea were investigated from 2005 to 2020. All morphological characteristics were significantly different among the eight rice cultivars. The dataset of morphological characteristics and yield was used to isolate groups of similar rice cultivars. The k-means clustering method was used to group the rice cultivars. Three groups (Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3) were created. Most cultivars were in Group 1. High-yielding rice cultivars were in Group 2, while the rice cultivars in Group 3 had the lowest rice grain yield. After grouping these rice cultivars, ideal farming locations for all three rice cultivar groups were identified to reduce transportation cost using an optimized location–allocation model. Simulation results suggested the following: (1) Group 1 should be produced in Jellanam-do (south west region), (2) Group 2 should be produced in Chungcheongnam-do (central west region), and (3) Group 3 should be mainly produced in the central west region of South Korea. Simulation results showed the potential to reduce transportation cost by around 0.014%. This can also reduce 21.04 tons of CO2 emission from a freight truck. Because these eight cultivars only make up 19.76% of the total rice production in South Korea, the cost reduction proportion was only 0.014% of total revenue. In future studies, more rice cultivars should be investigated to increase the efficiency of the model performance. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Travel scheme planning is a crucial operational-level decision to be made in travel supply chain management. We investigate an integrated self-driving travel scheme planning (ISTSP) problem to optimize routing, hotel selection, and time scheduling under several streams of personalized considerations: best site-viewing time windows, rest requirements, and preference for site visiting sequences. The travel scheme planning problem is formulated in two models: (i) total cost minimization, and (ii) bi-objective optimization with total cost minimization and tourists’ utility maximization. A heuristic solution framework integrating multi-categorical attribute K-means clustering, dynamic programming algorithm, and constraint satisfaction procedure is designed to solve these two models. Finally, we provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed models and solution methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This comprehensive study aims to identify from a strategic perspective a new port classification approach based on port features and characteristics. Data of 3,685 ports worldwide have been collected, and 25 dimensions with 62 factors have been identified and utilized to analyze and classify ports worldwide. The K-means clustering technique has been utilized to conduct the port classification process at several levels. First, ports have been classified into two general clusters (low capabilities and moderate-to-high capabilities). Then only ports with moderate-to-high potentials were classified and taxonomized. In addition to identifying and classifying ports with moderate-to-high capabilities, findings of the second round demonstrate the existence of three main clusters. The new port classification has been used to provide new insights about the top 50 terminal ports as a real case study.

abstract={Wireless connectivity plays a crucial role in col-lecting data from a large number of devices and sensors for various Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications including supply chain management and personalized healthcare. In most IoT applications, for various reasons, a collected data set may include incorrect or corrupted data samples, which should be detected and removed. For example, malicious devices may send fake information or malfunctioned remote devices can respond improperly. In this paper, we study anomaly detection for wireless links, not data sets sent by devices, to see any anomalies in the physical and link layers associated with connected devices to a network. The resulting approach can be viewed as preemptive anomaly detection and be part of causal anomaly discovery that helps determine whether anomalies detected in a data set are caused by errors in wireless links or transceivers. © 2021 APSIPA.},

abstract={Environmental concerns relating to production affairs have made various organizations use green practices in different processes of supply chain, because the green supply chain management (GSCM) is considered as an important organizational philosophy to decrease environmental risks and as a preventive approach in order to increase environmental performance and achievement of competitive advantages for organizations. The purpose of the present article is to design an interactive model for the practices of GSCM and its application to clustering oil industries for analyzing their green performance. Therefore, the literature was studied and a total of fifteen practices were obtained using experts’ opinions in academic and oil industry professionals. In next, the fuzzy interpretative structural modeling (FISM) approach was utilized so as to determine the relationship between the practices through considering the linguistic ambiguities of judgments and designing the structural model. The existing relationships within the structural model were studied and tested by means of structural equation modeling (SEM). After that, the relative importance of each practice was calculated by applying fuzzy analysis network process (FANP). In the next, the oil industries were categorized in two clusters using the K-means algorithm aggregated to the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Results of the present study showed that ‘‘legal requirements and regulations”, ‘‘intra-organizational environmental management”, ‘‘green design” and ‘‘green technology” are of root and influential practices with relatively more importance than others; in addition, it was cleared that the first cluster industries have high performance whereas the second ones have medium performance from the viewpoint of considering the practices of GSCM. Finally, the discriminant function designed to forecasting environment performance of the oil industries and membership to clusters for each of them. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Reasonable logistics distribution network structure can not only effectively reduce the cost of logistics enterprises themselves but also reduce the social cost. Through effective supply chain management, enterprises can significantly reduce costs, improve competitiveness, and enhance their ability to resist risks. Because the single-level distribution network structure of production enterprises is not suitable for large-scale logistics distribution, this paper proposes a distribution network structure design that accords with economies of scale and establishes an enterprise supply chain optimization model based on the fuzzy clustering algorithm. Using this optimization method to optimize the inventory of enterprise logistics supply chain, the operation is fast, the result is correct and reasonable, and it can provide good decision support for the distribution network of logistics enterprises. Through information technology and modern management technology, we should effectively control and coordinate the logistics, information flow, and capital flow in the production and operation process and organically integrate the internal supply chain with the external supply chain for management, so as to achieve the goal of global optimization. © 2021 Shizhen Bai and Hongbin Sun.},

abstract={Human Resource management is among the most critical issues of supply chain management. However, in today's rivalry world, the supply chains should be flexible enough to adapt to market changes. In this regard, designers and executive engineers play a crucial role in responding to market needs, affecting the supply chain system reconfiguring and developing sustainable systems accordingly. This study evaluates the impact of individual and social harmful factors on creativity inaction period in supply chains. The subjects consisted of 362 experts in supply chains using clustering sampling. For this purpose, two questionnaires are designed based on Mood and Feeling Questionnaire (MFQ). The reliability showed that Cronbach's Alphas were 0.953 and 0.797 for individual and social questionnaires, respectively. Results show that the harmful individual and social factors impose adverse effects on individual employees that cause different inaction periods named short-term, long-term, and organizational death of individual creativity inertia. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The rapid development of emerging technologies such as machine learning and data mining promotes a lot of smart applications, e.g., Internet of things (IoT). The supply chain management and communication are a key research direction in the IoT environment, while the inventory management (IM) has increasingly become a core part of the whole life cycle management process of the supply chain. However, the current situations of a long supply chain life cycle, complex supply chain management, and frequently changing user demands all lead to a sharp rise in logistics and communication cost. Hence, as the core part of the supply chain, effective and predictable IM becomes particularly important. In this way, this work intends to reduce the cost during the life cycle of the supply chain by optimizing the IM process. Specifically, the IM process is firstly formulated as a mathematical model, in which the objective is to jointly minimize the logistic cost and maximize the profit. On this basis, a deep inventory management (DIM) method is proposed to address this model by using the long short-term memory (LSTM) theory of deep learning (DL). In particular, DIM transforms the time series problem into a supervised learning one and it is trained using the back propagation pattern, such that the training process can be finished efficiently. The experimental results show that the average inventory demand prediction accuracy of DIM exceeds about 80%, which can reduce the inventory cost by about 25% compared with the other state-of-the-art methods and detect the anomaly inventory actions quickly. © 2021 Chuning Deng and Yongji Liu.},

abstract={Agriculture is a fundamental human activity and has a lot of significance in India. The quality and quantity of production have reduced drastically due to diseases that occur and impact of bad weather. Though farmers are producing a good quantity of crops, middle men are stealing the benefits, and this leads to a curb in financial position to start the next crop. The utilization of blockchain technology in the agriculture sector can yield significant results by creation of direct markets to farmers as the blockchain tools are capable of tracing the origin of appetite as it facilitates the creation of reliable food supply chain and constructs faith among the consumer and farmer. It is the reliable process of storing data that smooth the progress of various aspects of the information motivated tools that makes smarter agriculture and this chapter examines the main areas of smart farming, insurance to farm, agricultural transactions and food supply chains. The blockchain technology is growing as an inclusive full-fledged technology which can be utilized in almost all smart applications established within future generation aspects of the Internet, and it is a flourishing technology where each and every node that is involved within the blockchain comprises a disseminated ledger that reinforces the protection and transparency aspects of data. Prohibited users will be restricted to perform any illegitimate transaction in the blockchain network as it has the potential to perform smart contract and consensus. Due to COVID-19 Indian government has taken decision to facilitate farmers to sell their crops anywhere in India and the Real time environment IoT can be combined with the block chain to get better the performance by eliminating the middleperson. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Purpose: The COVID-19 crisis has shown that the global supply chains are not as resilient as expected. First investigations indicate that the main contributing factor is a lack of visibility into the supply chain's lower tiers. Simultaneously, the willingness to share data in the supply chain is low as companies mainly consider their data as proprietary. However, large amounts of data are available on the internet. The amount of this data is steadily increasing; however, the problem remains, that this data is hardly structured. Therefore, this paper investigates current approaches to use this data for supply chain transparency and derives further research directions. Methodology: The paper uses a systematic review of the literature followed by content analysis. The research process further follows established frameworks in the literature and is subdivided into distinct stages. Findings: Descriptive and clustering results show a fragmented research field, where current approaches disconnect from prior research. We classify the methods using a simple taxonomy and show developments from rule-based to supervised techniques and horizontal to vertical mining approaches. The techniques with rule-based-matching procedures mainly suffer from low recall. The current approaches do not satisfy yet essential requirements on supply chain mapping based on natural language. Originality: To the best of the authors' knowledge, no prior research has been attempted to review textual data usage for supply chain mapping. Therefore, this paper's main contribution is to fill this gap and add further evidence to the use of data-driven supply chain management methods. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={algorithms could provide as a means of producing efficient and flexible inventory management methods. In this way, although there are some methods to carry out this practice, none are set up for impulse purchase products. This article illustrates this perspective within the context of an impulse purchase product provisioning problem and shows how group policies based on a clustering process can result in better (lower cost) groupings. To solve this problem, a method is proposed for finding a near-optimal inventory grouping solution. The key innovation in this solution is the idea to form groups for the items that have similar demand or ordering and cost characteristics. Subsequently, once the clusters have been formed, it was necessary to look at aggregating impulse purchase SKUs, and then two grouping techniques or heuristics that both consider common characteristics and develop some ordering decision rules are presented. The results show that the proposed method can be used to cluster impulse purchase products more effectively and the grouping techniques applied were efficient in terms of solution quality. The aim of the proposed unsupervised clustering-based method was not only to provide a classification of SKUs free of subjectivity processes but also to provide an approach to apply more efficient inventory policies for impulse purchase products. © 2021 School of Science, IHU.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study is to bridge the gap in the literature on supply chain finance (SCF) by exploring the relationship between network capabilities and corporate financial performance (CFP) in financial supply chains (FSCs). Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect panel data and adopt regression analysis to analyse the joint investment activities among 1359 manufacturing firms and 289 financial service providers in China to explore how network capabilities, both network power and network centrality, improve CFP in the FSCs. Findings: Under the FSCs environments, network centrality (i.e. eigenvector centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality) raises CFP (ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q) and network power (node degree, clustering coefficient) also improves CFP. However, node strength from the network power stream has a negative effect on Tobin's Q, indicating that when the partner of a firm has an extremely strong influence in FSCs; this weakens the bargaining ability and flexibility of the focal firm, thus reducing its long-term financial performance. Practical implications: The joint investment activities among supply chain partners and financial service providers help managers understand the advanced financing solutions generated by internal and external network organisations as well as be aware of network capabilities' impact on CFP in FSCs. Originality/value: This study answers the call for more empirical research on SCF to provide a broader sample to examine financial supply chain management. This is one of the earliest studies to shed light on a new perspective – how network capabilities improve CFP in the FSCs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Carbon removal is a major task for environmentalists, because of its deep effect on human. Some problems such as inventory control, automatic e-supply chain and customer–consumer interaction techniques are used in machinery and method of apply. To minimize these issues, some hypothesis has been given. These hypotheses are totally based on questionnaires getting from relevant industries. It is observed that there is a big difference between the on paper applied procedure by the top administrative level and the procedure actually applied in the industries. A fuzzy-applied DEMATEL phenomenon is adopted for the recognition of the relationship and importance of different elements actually applied in this paper. The results getting from the hypothesis show the feasibility of the system. So our objectives are to establish the relationship among these various factors using these hypotheses. The last part of the paper ends with the discussion & research proposed by researchers. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The Capacitated Centered Clustering Problem (CCCP)—a multi-facility location model—is very important within the logistics and supply chain management fields due to its impact on industrial transportation and distribution. However, solving the CCCP is a challenging task due to its computational complexity. In this work, a strategy based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and dispersion reduction is presented to obtain the most likely locations of facilities for sets of client points considering their distribution patterns. Experiments performed on large CCCP instances, and considering updated best-known solutions, led to estimate the performance of the GMMs approach, termed as Dispersion Reduction GMMs, with a mean error gap smaller than 2.6%. This result is more competitive when compared to Variable Neighborhood Search, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm and CKMeans and faster to achieve when compared to the best-known solutions obtained by Tabu-Search and Clustering Search. © 2021.

abstract={In this paper, we propose efficient food traceability management techniques using the Internet of things and derive a solution for data transmission. The enhanced Petri net model is utilized for food traceability using the improved period data. The application of the food traceability is used to maintain the automation, minimized cost and reduced system complexity. The primary parameter for this system is the food transportation from the producer to the customer. The Internet of Things is utilized to connect the producer to the customer with a smart transportation system. A low-cost solution is obtained using the IoT based food traceability. The application of the food traceability is used to maintain the automation, minimized cost and reduced system complexity. The Enhanced Petri Net model is simulated and the experimental results proved that the proposed Enhanced Petri Net algorithm is more efficient for food traceability management Techniques compared to the K-means and SOM methods. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In the broad sense, the Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that possess unique methodical features to model dependencies in complex networks, such as forward and backward propagation (inference) of disruptions. BNs have transitioned from an emerging topic to a growing research area in supply chain (SC) resilience and risk analysis. As a result, there is an acute need to review existing literature to ascertain recent developments and uncover future areas of research. Despite the increasing number of publications on BNs in the domain of SC uncertainty, an extensive review on their application to SC risk and resilience is lacking. To address this gap, we analyzed research articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals from 2007 to 2019 using network analysis, visualization-based scientometric analysis, and clustering analysis. Through this study, we contribute to literature by discussing the challenges of current research, and, more importantly, identifying and proposing future research directions. The results of our survey show that further debate on the theory and application of BNs to SC resilience and risk management is a significant area of interest for both academics and practitioners. The applications of BNs, and their conjunction with machine learning algorithms to solve big data SC problems relating to uncertainty and risk, are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Despite the growing awareness about Circular Economy (CE) in production and supply chain management, there is little evidence linking CE practices to environmental and economic performances, especially within the traditional wood furniture industry in Indonesia. As with other management practices, implementation of CE can be supported by various factors. Among these factors are the so-called environmental-oriented supply chain cooperation (ESCC) practices. The study reported in this paper has three purposes. First, to investigate how the different levels of ESCC practices will affect the CE practices across the traditional wooden furniture industry in Central Java, Indonesia; second, to investigate the relationship between varying ESCC practices (which is grouped based on the implementation of CE practices) on the CE-targeted performances; and third, to examine the role of ESCC practices as a moderating variable in the relationship between CE practices and CE-targeted performances. This study uses primary data which were collected through closed questionnaires to 190 valid samples of wooden furniture SMEs across the cities of Jepara, Kudus, Rembang, Semarang, Blora and Surakarta. The data were processed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), K-means clustering analysis, Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and regression analysis. The results indicated that, depending on the levels of ESCC practices, the SMEs could be grouped into leaders, followers and laggard, which also determined the extent to which they practised the CE principles. The study also elaborated on the interactions between ESCC and CE practices, and how these might affect the CE-targeted environmental and economic performances. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze demand forecast strategies to support a more sustainable management in a pallet supply chain, and thus avoid environmental impacts, such as reducing the consumption of forest resources. Design/methodology/approach: Since the producer presents several uncertainties regarding its demand logs, a methodology that embed zero-inflated intelligence is proposed combining fuzzy time series with clustering techniques, in order to deal with an excessive count of zeros. Findings: A comparison with other models from literature is performed. As a result, the strategy that considered at the same time the excess of zeros and low demands provided the best performance, and thus it can be considered a promising approach, particularly for sustainable supply chains where resources consumption is significant and exist a huge variation in demand over time. Originality/value: The findings of the study contribute to the knowledge of the managers and policymakers in achieving sustainable supply chain management. The results provide the important concepts regarding the sustainability of supply chain using fuzzy time series and clustering techniques. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Like many countries, the extent of road safety in Tunisia is considerable. In addition, road accidents cause extensive economic losses. It is in this perspective that the requirement of safety has become a priority value, a goal that applies to everyone, especially in the field of transport. The objective of this research is to examine pedestrian-vehicle collisions (PVC) in coastal regions in Tunisia in term of area of occurrence under peak time periods. To do so, an innovative and integrated two-step approach was applied. Firstly, Ripley's K-function was used to detect the highway segments, where PVC were significantly clustered, dispersed or random. Secondly, Since PVC are distributed over a Network Kernel Density Estimation approach will be used to detect where exactly road accidents aggregates across the study area under peak time periods in order to predict some hourly trend to the PVC distribution and to find whether the detected high-risk locations are subject to temporal fluctuation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this research is the first to examine road accidents in term of hotspot analysis under peak time periods. The findings of this has significant implications for public decision-maker to enhance road safety situation, especially with the considerable surge in the vehicle fleet in Tunisia. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Research on port competitiveness is necessary for the development of countries' economies and is also important for the survival and development of ports. In this work, we have identified the main factors related to the assessment of the provided port competitiveness based on a literature review. Next, we have compared the port competitiveness limited to the Mediterranean basin according to 5 criteria (Connectivity Index, Container Traffic, Port Infrastructure Quality, Export Cost and Import Cost). As part of this article, we have adopted the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method and the Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) of during the period 2010-2018. The results show the existence of two elements that prevent the competitiveness of Mediterranean port systems (Export Cost and Import Cost), and we need a strategy to improve competitiveness. The Hierarchical Cluster Analysis gave us three classes of countries. In the first class, Tunisia and Albania are classified according to their quality of port infrastructure. The second class includes Syria, Algeria, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro according to the cost of export and import. The third class is made up of France, Italy, Turkey and Spain. These countries have a big volume of trade and high connectivity with other countries. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={This study reviews Internet of Things (IoT) research in supply chain management (SCM) and logistics. A thorough review and bibliometric analysis were conducted to analytically and objectively unearth the knowledge development in IoT research within the context of SCM and logistics. The analysis started with the selection of 807 journal articles published over a two-decade period. Then, the articles were analyzed according to bibliometric parameters such as year of publication, sources, authors, and institutions. A keyword co-occurrence network was used to cluster the pertinent literature. Results of the review and bibliometric analysis reveal that IoT research has attracted significant attention from the SCM and logistics community. Three leading journals published widely on IoT and the fifteen most productive authors are identified. Based on the keyword co-occurrence clustering, the IoT literature in SCM and logistics is focalized on RFID technology, Industry 4.0 technologies, reverse logistics, and additionally covers various industries, such as the food, retailing, construction, and the pharmaceutical sector. The study provides researchers with a better understanding of IoT research in SCM and logistics and existing knowledge gaps for further research. Practitioners may benefit from the review to keep abreast of the current discussions and applications of IoT in diverse industrial sectors. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current review is one of the few attempts to investigate IoT research in SCM and logistics using a comprehensive set of articles published during the past two decades. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={In the field of supply chain management (SCM), attracting and developing appropriate talent is critical for achieving most SCM goals, as extensive skills are necessary to do the job properly. In order to ensure that future-proof talent can continue to emerge in this discipline, the role of SCM executives is extremely important. Although many studies have been conducted in the field of talent management (TM), the future role of SCM executives has been mostly neglected in research. The present empirical study addresses this gap, taking into consideration the fourth industrial revolution, as innovation in technology continues to drive significant changes in the SCM field. Aiming to investigate the extent to which increasing digitalization is influencing the future role of SCM executives, a Delphi study with 103 experts from industry, academics, and politics/associations was carried out. In order to identify meaningful topic clusters from the data, fuzzy c-means clustering was used. From an actor-network theory perspective, our results show that in some areas of TM, digitalization is leading to a strong fusion of SCM executives and digital technologies, as well as to a clear division of roles, in which either SCM leaders or technology will dominate in the future. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={Big data analytics (BDA) in supply chain management (SCM) is receiving a growing attention. This is due to the fact that BDA has a wide range of applications in SCM, including customer behavior analysis, trend analysis, and demand prediction. In this survey, we investigate the predictive BDA applications in supply chain demand forecasting to propose a classification of these applications, identify the gaps, and provide insights for future research. We classify these algorithms and their applications in supply chain management into time-series forecasting, clustering, K-nearest-neighbors, neural networks, regression analysis, support vector machines, and support vector regression. This survey also points to the fact that the literature is particularly lacking on the applications of BDA for demand forecasting in the case of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) and accordingly highlights avenues for future research. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Fuzzy C-Means clustering is among the most successful clustering techniques available in the literature. The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is one of the most studied NP-hard problems. CVRP has attracted the attention of many researchers due to its importance within the supply chain management field. This study aims to develop a fuzzy c-means clustering heuristic to efficiently solve the CVRP with large numbers of customers by using cluster-first route-second method (CFRS). CFRS is a two-phase technique, where in the first phase customers are grouped into, and in the second phase each cluster is solved independently as a traveling salesman problem (TSP). This work is concerned the clustering phase of the CFRS. The second phase of the CFRS method is solved using traditional optimization software. A modified demand weighted fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is developed to solve the clustering phase. Twentyfive instances are solved to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Some of them are large instances with more than 500 customers. Promising results in terms of accuracy and processing time are obtained. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Unique features of solar energy, such as the low cost of operation and low pollution, make photovoltaic power plants attractive. Despite the advantages of these power plants, such as low cost of operation and operating without pollution, their high establishment cost compared to that of the conventional fossil fuel-fired power plants prevents their rapid growth. Therefore, designing and optimizing an efficient supply chain network will help to develop the photovoltaic industry. This study proposes a bi-objective model to design and optimize a thin-film photovoltaic power plant supply chain network integrating reverse logistics. The first objective minimizes the costs of supply chain network design, which optimizes decisions from suppliers to disposal centers. The second objective maximizes the efficiency of the data envelopment analysis model to find suitable locations of facilities. As there is uncertainty in electricity demand prediction and perfect foresight is not possible, a fuzzy-robust programming approach is devised to cope with the uncertain parameters. The validity and practicality of the proposed approach are investigated by a case study based on real-world data. Finally, K-Means clustering is incorporated into the model to analyze the installed photovoltaic capacity of different cities in each period. The results show that using an optimistic approach to deal with uncertainty reduces the total cost by 20% in comparison with using a pessimistic approach. The results also provide helpful insights for decision-makers and policymakers in allocating and optimizing the operation of facilities by considering the real-world characteristics of the candidate locations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Nowadays, the critical dimensions (CD) of semiconductor manufacturing processes are gradually declining, and various materials, reactants, or machine equipment is becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, the green supply chain management (GSCM) of smart high-tech factories has also become the target of competition for cutting-edge companies, because of this management. The more mature the mechanism of high production speed, lower operating costs and the higher the quality. In addition, corporate social responsibility (CSR) governance has also become an important investment evaluation item for semiconductor factories in recent years. As long as internationally renowned manufacturers start CSR, it is a pity that there are already some manufacturers. The establishment of a supply chain management system also synchronously promotes CSR, but there are few manufacturers that integrate CSR and green supply chain management, let alone the application of an intelligent management platform (IMP). This study builds a GSM platform (GSMP) based on the aforementioned problems, and the cluster analysis of K-means is used to optimize the management platform to optimize the overall performance of the management platform. Through the simulation results of this study, it is found that the performance of this management platform is far superior to the current mechanism of using human operation, whether it is the speed of emergency processing or the final management operation performance, which shows that this study industry contribution. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Sustainability commitments by private sector actors are emerging as interventions to help reduce global deforestation. Much attention is placed on the forest conservation impact of these interventions in areas where commodity production constitutes a main driver of deforestation. It is, however, less clearly understood what role they could play in areas where the production of commodities is not evidently leading to the loss of forest and how they could contribute to other objectives including sustainable rural development and peacebuilding. In this paper, we examine the potential of the cocoa sector in Colombia in achieving deforestation reduction and peacebuilding simultaneously, as aimed by the country's Cocoa, Forests and Peace Initiative. Results from correlations and spatially explicit analyses show that regardless of its widespread production across Colombia, in the past fifteen years cocoa has not been an important driver of deforestation. This suggests that efforts to end deforestation in the Colombian cocoa sector emerged following global trends, and not because of an evident link between cocoa production and deforestation. Furthermore, results from spatial clustering analyses highlight areas where different types of value chain interventions may be appropriate to parallel forest conservation and peacebuilding, while interviews with key actors in the cocoa sector provide clues as to how these interventions should be developed and implemented. Specifically, our results show that narratives around approaches to achieve zero deforestation from agricultural commodities should (1) be adjusted to local contexts, (2) incorporate location-specific development needs, (3) complement existing rural development efforts, (4) enhance collaboration among actors that operate both within and beyond the value chain, and (5) apply high-resolution data to assess deforestation-commodity relations and verify zero-deforestation commitments. These considerations are particularly relevant in contexts where commodity production is not evidently leading to deforestation, as in the case of cocoa production in Colombia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In all information systems it is very important to operate with correct information. Incorrect information can lead to many problems that can cause direct financial and reputation loss of the company. Data used by the system can be gathered by sensors, scripts or by hand. In all those cases, mistakes are possible. It is important to detect mistakes on time and stop them from propagating further into the system. In this paper, a novel multi-step anomaly detection algorithm based on the greatest common divisor and median value is described. The algorithm for anomaly detection in historical sales data is used as a part of the smart warehouse management system which is implemented in some of the largest distribution companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The algorithm showed significant results in anomaly detection on company orders and improved a number of processes in the operation of the smart warehouse management system. The algorithm described can also be used in other areas where the transaction data is collected, such as sales and banking, © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: Reverse logistics (RL), an inseparable aspect of supply chain management, returns used products to recovery processes with the aim of reducing waste generation. Enterprises, however, seem reluctant to apply RL due to various types of risks which are perceived as posing an economic threat to businesses. This paper draws on a synthesis of supply chain and risk management literature to identify and cluster RL risk factors and to recommend risk mitigation strategies for reducing the negative impact of risks on RL implementation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors identify and cluster risk factors in RL by using risk management theory. Experts in RL and supply chain risk management validated the risk factors via a questionnaire. An unsupervised data mining method, self-organising map, is utilised to cluster RL risk factors into homogeneous categories. Findings: A total of 41 risk factors in the context of RL were identified and clustered into three different groups: strategic, tactical and operational. Risk mitigation strategies are recommended to mitigate the RL risk factors by drawing on supply chain risk management approaches. Originality/value: This paper studies risks in RL and recommends risk management strategies to control and mitigate risk factors to implement RL successfully. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Nowadays global supply chains enable companies to enhance competitive advantages, increase manufacturing flexibility and reduce costs through a broader selection of suppliers. Despite these benefits, however, insufficient understanding of uncertain regional differences and changes often increases risks in supply chain operations and even leads to a complete disruption of a supply chain. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a text-mining based global supply chain risk management framework involving two phases. First, the extant literature about global supply chain risks was collected and analyzed using a text-based approaches, including term frequency, correlation, and bi-gram analysis. The results of these analyses revealed whether the term-related content is important in the studied literature, and correlated topic model clustering further assisted in defining potential supply chain risk factors. A risk categorization (hierarchy) containing a total of seven global supply chain risk types and underlying risk factors was developed based on the results. In the second phase, utilizing these risk factors, sentiment analysis was conducted on online news articles, selected according to the specific type of risk, to recognize the pattern of risk variation. The risk hierarchy and sentiment analysis results can improve the understanding of regional global supply chain risks and provide guidance in supplier selection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study proposes an algorithm based upon the rounding strategy for the k-clustering minimum completion problem. An instance of the problem is defined in a complete bipartite graph of S and C vertices. The goal of the problem is to decompose the initial graph into k-clusters, where each cluster is a complete bipartite subgraph. Since the problem is NP hard, any exact solver, like Cplex, is often not sufficient to achieve solutions with relatively hight quality. Thus, we propose a first alternative solution procedure for tackling large-scale instances. The designed method can be viewed as a special variant of the rounding search-based algorithm and it can be applied for solving several complex optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a set of benchmark instances related to the k-clustering minimum completion problem, where its achieved results are compared to the best results available in the literature. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: Presented work gives comparative review of food supply chain (FSC) under various notions related to its conceptualisation, operationality and technological advancements in lieu with Industry 4.0 revolution. In Indian scenario, the impression of FSC seems in a scattered way that cannot be directly useful for an organisation, to overcome this scattering, a framework has been developed to consolidate the previous research works and exploration of new trends in food supply chain management (FSCM) in context to Indian scenario. Design/methodology/approach: This article encapsulates the essence of various research articles and reports retrieved from databases of Emerald and Elsevier's Science direct, clustering the various notions related to FSC in Indian context. To visualise the one-sight view of related works, a pictorial representations have also been appended. Findings: This article explains the general aspect of FSC and its linkage in context to Indian system. Presented work outlays both empirical and theoretical approaches trending from last 15 years. As research count in context to Indian FSC is lacking, so this work will be a road map for expedition in direction of FSCM, in era of research. Practical implications: Findings and suggestion in this work can expanded in various industries related to food, helping to turn their fortune and enrichment of Indian FSC. Social implications: Food is binding word for all the commodities, and its effective supply chain management is a big boon for economy of country along with large employment generation for people directly/indirectly associated with this industry. This article covers a generalise approach from ground level framework to a level of advancement which fulfil technological aspects, future needs and upcoming trends in lieu to need of developing nation. Originality/value: As limited research is done in Indian FSCM, this work to bridge this gap along with a well-defined framework which going to explore FSC. This work is going to be facilitation for researchers of this area as no major review for Indian context has not been published. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The aim of this paper is to classify suppliers into some clusters based on sustainability factors. However, there might be some unqualified suppliers and we should identify and remove those suppliers before clustering. Design/methodology/approach: First, using fuzzy screening system, the authors identify and remove the unqualified suppliers. Then, the authors run their proposed clustering method. This paper proposes a data envelopment analysis (DEA) algorithm to cluster suppliers. Findings: This paper presents a two-aspect DEA-based algorithm for clustering suppliers into clusters. The first aspect applied DEA to consider efficient frontiers and the second aspect applied DEA to consider inefficient frontiers. The authors examine their proposed clustering approach by a numerical example. The results confirmed that their method can cluster DMUs into clusters. Originality/value: The main contributions of this paper are as follows: This paper develops a new clustering algorithm based on DEA models. This paper presents a new DEA model in inefficiency aspect. For the first time, the authors’ proposed algorithm uses fuzzy screening system and DEA to select suppliers. Our proposed method clusters suppliers of MPASR based on sustainability factors. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Cold storage is the vital infrastructure of cold chain logistics. In this study, we analyzed the spatial pattern evolution characteristics, spatial autocorrelation and influencing factors of cold storage in China by using kernel density estimation (KDE), spatial autocorrelation analysis (SAA), and spatial error model (SEM). Results showed that: 1) the spatial distribution of cold storage in China is unbalanced, and has evolved from ‘one core’ to ‘one core and many spots’, that is, ‘one core’ refers to the Bohai Rim region mainly including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and Liaoning regions, and ‘many spots’ mainly include the high-density areas such as Shanghai, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Hefei, Wuhan, Ürümqi. 2) The distribution of cold storage has significant global spatial autocorrelation and local spatial autocorrelation, and the ‘High-High’ cluster area is the most stable, mainly concentrated in the Bohai Rim; the ‘Low-Low’ cluster area is grouped in the southern China. 3) Economic developmenficit. © 2020, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background Despite progress made over the past twenty years, child mortality remains high, with 5.3 million children under five years having died in 2018 globally. Pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria remain among the commonest causes of under-five mortality; contributing 15%, 8%, and 5% of global mortality respectively. Recent evidence shows that integrated community case management (iCCM) of pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria can reduce under-five mortality. However, despite growing evidence of the effectiveness of iCCM, there are implementation challenges, especially stock out of iCCM commodities and inadequate supportive supervision of community health workers (CHWs). This study aimed to address these two key challenges to successful iCCM implementation by using mobile health (mHealth) technology. Methods This cluster randomised controlled trial compared health centre catchment areas (clusters) where CHWs and their supervisors implemented mHealth-enhanced iCCM supportive supervision and supply chain management vs clusters implementing iCCM as per current Zambian guidelines. CHWs in intervention clusters used community DHIS2 platform on mobile phones to report on a weekly basis children with iCCM conditions and make requisitions for iCCM commodities. Their supervisors received electronic reports on disease caseloads and monthly automated supervision reminders. The supervisors on receipt of requisitions, organized the medical supplies and notified CHWs for collection. Intention-to-treat analysis on the primary outcome, the percentage of children aged 2-59 months receiving appropriate treatment for malaria, pneumonia, or diarrhoea from an iCCM trained CHW, was performed using a generalized linear model. Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals comparing the prevalence of appropriate treatment in the intervention and control groups were calculated using log binomial regression with an exchangeable correlation matrix, adjusted for clustering by health facility. Results In the intervention clusters, 61.3% (98/160) of expected monthly supervision visits took place vs 52.0% (78/150) in the controls. A total of 3690 children 2-59 months old presented with malaria, diarrhoea, or pneumonia. In the intervention group, 65.9% (1,252/1,899) of children received appropriate care for iCCM conditions, compared to 63.3% (1,134/1,791) in the control group. The mHealth intervention was associated with 18.0% improvement in supportive supervision and 21.0% increase in appropriate treatment for pneumonia; these changes were not statistically significant. There was a 2-3-fold increase in the proportion of CHWs receiving supplies ordered: prevalence ratios ranged from 2.82 (confidence interval (CI) = 1.50, 5.30) to 3.01 (95% CI = 1.29, 7.00) depending on the particular commodity. Conclusion This study was unable to determine whether using mHealth technology would strengthen supervision and supply chain management of iCCM commodities for community-level workers. There was no statistically significant effect of mHealth enhanced iCCM on appropriate diagnosis and treatment for children with malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhoea in rural Zambia. Longer term longitudinal studies are required to determine the impact of mHealth enhanced iCCM on health outputs and outcomes. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={The size and complexity of the software ecosystem is a major challenge for vendors, asset owners and cybersecurity professionals who need to understand the security posture of these systems. Annotated and Translated Disassembled Code is a graph based datastore designed to organize firmware and software analysis data across builds, packages and systems, providing a highly scalable platform enabling automated binary software analysis tasks including corpora construction and storage for machine learning. This paper describes an approach for the identification of ubiquitous third-party libraries in firmware and software using Annotated and Translated Disassembled Code and supervised machine learning. Annotated and Translated Disassembled Code provide matched libraries, function names and addresses of previously unidentified code in software as it is being automatically analyzed. This data can be ingested by other software analysis tools to improve accuracy and save time. Defenders can add the identified libraries to their vulnerability searches and add effective detection and mitigation into their operating environment. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The condition monitoring of food cold chain quality management systems is the key to ensuring the stable operation of food cold chain quality management systems. In the process of food cold chain quality management systems, it is necessary to accurately detect and identify the quality of food cold chain systems, and the quality management technology of food cold chain systems based on big data analysis is put forward. The statistical analysis model of food cold chain system quality management evaluation is constructed. Through the same kind of mapping and closed frequency complex item collection evaluation method, the hierarchical cluster analysis of data is carried out. The criterion of food cold chain quality management systems can be obtained by the Sigma test. In the statistical regression analysis model, the attribute set of food cold chain quality distribution big data in food cold chain quality management systems is constructed. There are six secondary indexes under the management scale of the enterprise, five secondary indexes under the warehousing management level, four secondary indicators under the logistics level, three information indexes under the information level, and three evaluation indexes under the customer management level. By using this evaluation system, the development status and operation status of fresh cold chain logistics can be reflected comprehensively, and the quality management of food cold chain systems can be determined. It is found that the reliability of this method for quality management of food cold chain systems is good. © 2020 Totem Publisher, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the second decade of the twenty-first century, supply chain management (SCM) practices have gained an increasingly strategic character. The focus has shifted from an operational perspective to a strategic one, and SCM is repeatedly cited in the literature as a strategic management tool with a profound effect on the survival of the organizations. SCM domain is well-supported to be closely linked with a number of strategic management views and theories. This study investigates the main strategic management views and theories relevant to SCM and their interactions. It reveals how they complementarily explain supply chain management characteristics of being customer-driven, process-oriented, global, strategically coupled, complex, dynamic, adaptive, multi-agent, IT-intensive, value creating, collaborative and networked. Based on a comprehensive literature taxonomy, a mapping of the main supply chain characteristics to these management views and theories is provided. A conceptual clustering of different management perspectives is developed, and their interactions are analyzed. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Food safety exists in various links such as food production, processing, transportation and sales, which affects the stable development of society. It has become an urgent problem for all countries in the world as how to make effective use of various safety inspection techniques, optimize the food processing and storage safety, predict potential food safety factors, and accurately assess and predict food safety risks. This study proposes a food safety risk prediction method based on brain neural network algorithm. Firstly, the key control points and index factors in the food safety supply chain are analyzed from the perspective of the food supply chain. Then the SOM self-organizing map and the K-means clustering method are used to select the data sets with high aggregation and low coupling to be used as training samples of neural network algorithm. Finally, three kinds of data are verified by BP neural network algorithm. The experimental results show that in food safety risk assessment and prediction, the data processed by two stages have better mean square error convergence, which increases the accuracy of neural network algorithm and improves the prediction effect. It provides a new prediction method for food safety risk prediction, which is of important practical significance. © 2020 Parlar Scientific Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In order to protect the environment and reduce energy consumption, new energy vehicles have begun to be vigorously promoted in various countries. In recent years, the rise of intelligent technology has had a great impact on the supply chain of new energy vehicles, which, coupled with the complexity of the supply chain itself, puts it at great risk. Therefore, it is quite indispensable to evaluate the risk of the new energy vehicle supply chain. This paper assesses the risks faced by China's new energy vehicle supply chain in this period of technological transformation. First of all, this paper establishes an evaluation criteria system of 16 sub-criterion related to three dimensions: the market risk, operational risk, and the environmental risk. Then, variable weight theory is proposed to modify the constant weight obtained by the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). Finally, a risk assessment of China's new energy vehicle supply chain is carried out by combining the variable weight and the cloud model. This method can effectively explain the randomness of matters, and avoid the influence of value abnormality on the criteria system. The results show that China's new energy vehicle supply chain is at a high level. Through the identification of risk factors, mainly referring to the low clustering risk, technical level risk and information transparency risk, this paper can provide a risk prevention reference for corresponding enterprises. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Prefabricated construction (PC), with the characteristics of green, environmentally friendly, energy saving and high production efficiency, is attracting more and more attention from all over the world. Supply chain management is closely related to the application efficiency of PC, but only in the last three years has this interdisciplinary research received due attention. The prefabricated construction supply chain management (PCSCM) have not received enough attention. Especially recently, the related literature shows explosive growth. This paper adopted the method of systematic literature review through the tool of bibliometric statistics. And we reviewed 152 articles from 2001 to 2018, with the goal of understanding the current situation, trends, and gaps in PCSCM research, and a framework is proposed to promote its development. First, the study discussed the four themes of clustering, concentrating mainly on strategic research and project evaluation, PC supply chain process design and optimization, supply chain integration and management, and the application of advanced technology. Then, the research gaps and conceptual development framework to promote PCSCM were reported. Only through the coordinated development of technology, market circumstances, and decision-making level of participants, can the PCSC form an integrated whole, so as to optimize the efficiency and sustainability of prefabricated construction industry and improve its level. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={The reliable operation of a logistics service supply chain (LSSC) is a key factor for improving logistics efficiency and service level, and vulnerability is an important indicator of reliable LSSC operation. Based on complex network theory, we reconstructed the running mechanism of logistics service providers, integrators, and demanders. We constructed an improved structure model of LSSC. By observing the selected three indicators (clustering coefficient, maximum connectivity, and network connectivity efficiency), the influence caused by the problem will continue to spread to more subjects along the network when a problem exists in one part of the network. The results showed that the destructive power of deliberate attacks is far greater than the damage caused by random attacks, and the disruption of logistics service integrators will considerably increase the vulnerability of the LSSC. However, even if logistics service integrators are removed completely, the LSSC still can operate at low efficiency. Through a case analysis, we identified the vulnerable nodes in logistics service, clarify the vulnerable mechanism in LSSC, and provide guidance for the operation of LSSC in real life. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Big data analysis has found applications in many industries due to its ability to turn huge amounts of data into insights for informed business and operational decisions. Advanced data mining techniques have been applied in many sectors of supply chains in the food industry. However, the previous work has mainly focused on the analysis of instrument-generated data such as those from hyperspectral imaging, spectroscopy, and biometric receptors. The importance of digital text data in the food and nutrition has only recently gained attention due to advancements in big data analytics. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the data sources, computational methods, and applications of text data in the food industry. Text mining techniques such as word-level analysis (e.g., frequency analysis), word association analysis (e.g., network analysis), and advanced techniques (e.g., text classification, text clustering, topic modeling, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis) will be discussed. Applications of text data analysis will be illustrated with respect to food safety and food fraud surveillance, dietary pattern characterization, consumer-opinion mining, new-product development, food knowledge discovery, food supply-chain management, and online food services. The goal is to provide insights for intelligent decision-making to improve food production, food safety, and human nutrition. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists®},

abstract={One of the greatest 21st century challenges is meeting the need to feed a growing world population which is expected to increase by about 35% by 2050. To meet this challenge, it is necessary to make major improvements on current food production and distribution systems capabilities, as well as to adapt these systems to expected trends such as climate change. Changing climate patterns may present opportunities for unidentified, geographical regions with adequate climate patterns to produce high-value agricultural products in a profitable and sustainable manner. This paper focuses on the design and planning aspects of a discovery process to unearth agri-food supply chains capable of generating attractive return on investments. A stochastic optimization framework is used to develop planting and harvesting schedules for a set of identified regions with complementary weather characteristics. To address the high-level of variability in the problem context, a two-stage stochastic decomposition method is used to consider a larger number of scenarios. As part of the solution process, a modeling scheme is developed that learns past interactions between entering discretized, weather scenarios and optimal first-stage solutions. In this context, machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques are used to iteratively estimate each region's probability of belonging to first-stage solutions based on previous solution-scenario results. The implementation of the stochastic framework is shown through a case study applied to multiple locations within the US southwest states of Arizona and New Mexico. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Network structures present within themselves specific characterization of their topological structures and connectivity. The properties of a given network change significantly as failure of its nodes and edges takes place. The failure of a node and/or edge reinstates the properties for the entire network. This paper aims to identify critical nodes and edges, the failure of which brings maximum change in the network properties. Clustering has been applied in this study for the identification process. The methodology discussed in this article would be helpful in tracking multi-states which a network undergoes due to failure of its nodes and edges. The proposed methodology would provide a holistic view for criticality of nodes and edges at both local and global level for a network. An optimum maintenance plan could then be devised for the critical nodes and edges to provide the system with a robust and resilient network. The proposed approach could be applied in power grid transmission, supply chain management, transportation and communication networks, oil, gas, power and water distribution networks to ensure continuous information and commodity flow through the networks. The methodology has been demonstrated with a case study in water distribution network. By applying the methodology, top five critical nodes and edges have been identified for the water distribution system. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this work, we present a new approach to solve the Capacitated Location-Routing Problem (CLRP). The aim of this method is to determine the depot locations, to assign customers to facilities and to define routes for each depot to serve the associated clients. The proposed approach contains two phases, which are the constructive phase and the improvement phase. In the first phase, we select the depots to be opened, allocate the customers to open depots using a Hierarchical Ascendant (HA) method and we solve the vehicle routing problem for each depot using Sweep algorithm. In the second phase, we apply a Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) with three structures in order to optimize the cost obtained by the first phase. Two sets of well-known instances from the literature are used to evaluate the performance of this method, and the numerical results obtained are compared with the experimental results of other methods. Results show that our method is competitive with respect to the best-known solutions (BKSs) and demonstrate its efficiency in comparison with other approaches. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={In this work, a multidepot multiperiod vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries (MDPVRPPD) is solved by optimizing logistics networks with collaboration and resource sharing among logistics service providers. The optimal solution can satisfy customer demands with periodic time characteristics and incorporate pickup and delivery services with maximum resource utilization. A collaborative mechanism is developed to rearrange both the open and closed vehicle routes among multiple pickup and delivery centers with improved transportation efficiency and reduced operational costs. The effects of resource sharing strategies combining customer information sharing, facility service sharing, and vehicle sharing are investigated across multiple service periods to maximize resource utilization and refine the resource configuration. A multiobjective optimization model is developed to formulate the MDPVRPPD so that the minimum total operational costs, waiting time, and the number of vehicles are obtained. A hybrid heuristic algorithm incorporating a 3D clustering and an improved multiobjective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO) algorithm is introduced to solve the MDPVRPPD and find Pareto optimal solutions. The proposed hybrid heuristic algorithm is based on a selective exchange mechanism that enhances local and global searching capabilities. Results demonstrate that the proposed IMOPSO outperforms other existing algorithms. We also study profit allocation issues to quantify the stability and sustainability of long-term collaboration among logistics participants, using the minimum costs remaining savings method. The proposed model and solution methods are validated by conducting an empirical study of a real system in Chongqing City, China. This study contributes to the development of efficient urban logistics distribution systems, and facilitates the expansion of intelligent and sustainable supply chains. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper examines the non-linear relationship between a firm’s inventory and sales performance. Specifically, whether there exists an optimal level of inventory that maximizes sales performance is investigated. In order to better understand the effect of supply chain inventories on firm performance, three types of inventories: raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods are separately considered. Analyzing the panel data set of 272 Korean manufacturing firms for the period 1996 to 2012, the following conclusions based on regression methodology has been drawn. After controlling for previous inventory, we find there exists an optimal level of current inventory that maximizes current firm profitability. Furthermore, it is examined whether the external competition level is high using clustering analysis. We find that the effects of supply chain inventories on performance are influenced by the competitive intensity of an industry. The results suggest that while all types of inventories show the non-linear effects on firm performance in the highly competitive market, only finished goods inventory shows significant effects on firm performance in the low competitive market. Our study provides empirical supports for how each type of inventories should be managed and contributes to the extant literature by suggesting managerial implications from a supply-chain perspective perspective for practical engineers and technical professionals. © 2020, © 2020 American Society for Engineering Management.},

abstract={The practice of managing customer loyalty to the organization's services based on the concept of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is becoming increasingly relevant in the supply chain strategies. It is necessary to study potential consumers, identify their requirements and develop a competent marketing strategy for building mutually beneficial relations of the organization with customers. The development of a mechanism for assessing consumer loyalty to the healthcare facility services, its automation with the help of customer relationship management tools should be methodologically justified. Purpose. The research is aimed at developing a methodological approach to healthcare customer loyalty assessment, including identification of target and profitable segments, regulation of business processes, analysis of the customer database and business environment of an organization to increase the effectiveness of its marketing activities. Systemic research of customer relationships includes the following methods and tools: Data Mining methods with instrumental support of Statistica software, including factor analysis and formation of databases of endogenous and exogenous variables; specification of a mathematical model; correlation analysis; variable multiple linear regression analysis based on the generalized least squares method; model verification using R2-statistics and Fisher (F-test) and Student (t-test) criteria; ABC-and XYZ analysis of revealing customer consumption profiles; the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on expert assessments of the multicriteria problem solution while evaluating the support tools for managing consumer loyalty with a hierarchical structure. The practical and theoretical significance of the results. A methodological approach has been developed to identify healthcare facility (HCF) customer preferences, implemented using a variable multiple linear regression model, including both quantitative (age, number of bed days, etc.) and qualitative (social status, gender, marital status, parental status, education, medical service type) exogenous variables. Consumption profiles of HCF services have been constructed on the basis of their clustering and classification using ABC-and XYZ analyzes. An algorithm for evaluating the support tools of the consumer loyalty analysis has been proposed. The analysis of consumer demand for the organization's services enables to develop an algorithm for assessing consumer loyalty management information systems, to form a system of indicators characterizing potential customers and their preferences in the medical services market; the most rational and customer-oriented services that reflect the customer's consumption profile. The results can be used as practical tools for improving the economic efficiency of the organization depending on the cluster dynamics of consumption and changes in personal customer characteristics and CRM-based marketing performance support tools. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

abstract={Today's business environment, survival and making profit in market are the prime requirement for any enterprise due to competitive environment. Innovation and staying updated are commonly identified two key parameters for achieving success and profit in business. Considerably supply chain management is also accountable for profit. As a measure to maximize the profit, supply chain process is to be streamlined and optimized. Appropriate grouping of various suppliers for the benefit of shipment cost reduction is proposed. Data relating to appropriate attributes of supplier logistics are collected. A methodology is proposed to optimize the supplier logistics using clustering algorithm. In the proposed methodology data preprocessing, clustering and validation process have been carried out. The Z-score normalization is used to normalize the data, which converts the data to uniform scales for improving the clustering performance. By employing Hierarchical and K-means clustering algorithms the supplier logistics are grouped and performance of each method is evaluated and presented. The supplier logistics data from different country is experimented. Outcome of this work can help the buyers to select the cost effective supplier for their business requirements. © 2020 SCPE.},

abstract={With the advent of Google maps, pointing the precise location and tracking the movement of objects, people and materials have become an integral part of SCM System. The ERP systems include Logistics and Management as core functionalities along with Artificial Intelligent Systems to facilitate positioning and tracking of materials. Similar to material tracking, it is also important to track the location and movement of the person which is a huge demand in present era. However, the designers of such larger ERP systems use patented protocols for material location identification, predicting the shortest distance and tracking the precise location of cargo when they are on the move. The similar techniques neither fully adopted nor applied with humans. This research paper is aimed at finding out the most efficient route by comparing the most popular Apriori and the Dijkstra algorithms. Apriori algorithm involves supervised mining using association rules which can be used for finding right paths whereas the same can be estimated by the Dijkstra’s algorithm, taking the connecting nodes in the graph. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Due to this kind of demand, healthcare supply chains (SC) need to keep high inventory levels to ensure high availability of medicines to save people's lives. We develop a method that effectively utilises the data mining concepts as well as gravitational search algorithm (GSA) for optimal inventory control. The proposed method consists of two key functions, mining association rules for inventory and choosing SC cost-impact rules. Initially, the association rules are mined from EMA-based healthcare inventory data. After that, SC cost-impact rules are chosen for every SC member using GSA. The obtained SC cost-impact rules will possibly signify the future state of inventory in any SC member. Furthermore, the level of holding or reducing the inventory can be determined from the SC cost-impact rules. Thus, the SC cost-impact rules that are derived using the proposed method greatly facilitate optimal inventory control and hence make the supply chain management more effective.

abstract={Over the past 30 years, scholars have been calling for modern management theory and research to consider how strategic management tools could be applied to enhance corporate sustainability. While strategic management for sustainability has emerged as a multidisciplinary field, the existing knowledge base has yet to be systematic reviewed. This paper responded to the literature gap by conducting a bibliometric review of strategic management for sustainability. The paper aimed to document the landscape and composition of this literature through the analysis of 988 relevant Scopus-indexed documents. Data analyses found that the strategic management for sustainability knowledge base remained an emergent field with increasing interests from diverse groups of international scholars in various fields, particularly in environmental science, engineering, and strategic business management. Over the past three decades, the literatures have been continuously grown from a few publications in the early 1990s to almost 1000 documents to date. The review found that the most influential journals and authors of this knowledge base were international in scope but predominately from Western developed countries. Five Schools of Thought from author co-citation analysis revealed the intellectual clustering composition of the knowledge base on strategic management for sustainability: corporate sustainability strategy, sustainable waste management, strategic sustainability systems, strategic sustainability management and entrepreneurship, and sustainability assessment strategy. Key topics addressed in this research include the distribution of documents across the most highly cited journals, reflecting the breadth, quality and influential scholars in the strategic management for sustainability knowledge domain, naming of the influential scholars in the field and identification of contemporary foci and research front in the existing literature through the keyword co-occurrence analysis and co-word map. The strategic management for sustainability field has evolved from the key topics related to the green movement at the policy-driven macro level (i.e., ecological or environmental protection/impact, water/waste management and natural resource conservation) to the practicality in organizations with the topics related to social strategic responsibility and business management issues (i.e., corporate strategy, project management, supply chain management, information management, adaptive management, corporate sustainability). In addition to a retrospective, insightful prospective interpretation, practical implication, limitations and future research direction are discussed. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={This research presents a systematic and integrated approach that extends the correlated storage assignment strategy to improve the efficiency of warehouse order picking operations. The correlated storage assignment can reduce a significant amount of travel costs, but could lead to traffic congestion due to the imbalanced traffic flow. Hence, this research proposes the correlated and traffic balanced storage assignment (C&TBSA) to minimize the travel time and picking delays, which is modeled in two stages: clustering and assignment. In the clustering stage, a bi-objective optimization model is formulated to group items with the consideration of both travel efficiency and traffic flow balance, which is solved using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). In the assignment stage, items in each cluster are distributed to the available storage locations. C&TBSA is evaluated with an actual warehouse case study and the results show that C&TBSA outperforms random, class-based, and correlated storage assignment methods by 48.74%, 23.82%, and 7.58% respectively, regarding the total time consisting of travel time and picking delays. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent years, major local and global disruptions have had significant adverse effects on corporate performance, particularly for businesses with long, global supply chains. Managing disruption and its effects has therefore become a key focus for firms. While the process of disruption management has attracted considerable research attention, much of it has been directed at the pre-disruption stage. This study investigates the post-disruption stage, and its management. The unpredictability of disruption magnitude and nature suggests that the post-disruption management process may be as important, if not more so, than pre-determined pre-disruption strategies. An effective post-disruption management process would directly affect actual ability to recover from sudden and serious disruptions. This study analyzes six companies, variously positioned upstream and downstream in the supply chain of the information and communications technology (ICT) industry in Taiwan. Specific factors and strategies relating to the post-disruption management process were collected by conducting in-depth interviews with the managers and executives of the firms. The information was categorized into distinct disruption management process stages: discovery, recovery, and supply chain redesign. The study findings are interesting and at times, new and counter-intuitive, including the surprising positive effects of clustering in disruptions, and the role of back-up supplier and material verification in disruption recovery. The study emerges with an integrated framework that can be utilized to establish an effective post-disruption management process. The framework is used to develop research propositions for future research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={As supply chain has become extremely complicated, traditional supply chain management schemes reveal limitations in keeping track of resources for efficient risk management. Recently, blockchain-based solutions for supply chain have shown possibility to overcome those limits. However, numerous practical problems in this research domain are not fully explored up to date. Thus, we delve into one of the most significant problems among them: Verification of business logic in transactions. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed ledger system for supply chain, enabled by anomaly detection framework that verifies semantic correctness of transactions based on business context data. Our blockchain data model is tailored to accurately represent events occurred in supply chain based on real-world business standards. In order to facilitate more efficient tracking of provenance, we leverage graph data model to represent supply chain network. On top of the data model, we present smart contract-based anomaly detection framework that verifies whether a transaction is anomalous. Generic rule-based and graph-based detection methods are devised. The feasibility of our proposed model is shown by the system implemented using Hyperledger Sawtooth. We show how our anomaly detection layer can be plugged into the system: How it interacts with other system components, and how overall system flow works with this new function. We evaluate our system with scenario-based simulations. For a number of use cases we synthesized, the correctness and effectiveness of our system are demonstrated. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is one of the important problems that has been examined extensively over the past decades. The problem holds a central position within the fields of transportation logistics and supply chain management. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, many researchers have developed several heuristics and metaheuristics to solve the problem. This research proposes a hybrid bat algorithm to solve the VRP. The algorithm employs the Bat algorithm hybridized with a modified kmeans algorithm. The proposed solution technique adopts the methodology of cluster first route second to decompose the original VRP into traveling sales man problems (TSPs) with reduced complexity. Benchmark test instances from the literature are used to prove the efficiency of the proposed hybrid algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Anomaly detection has been becoming an important problem in several domains. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect anomalies in time series based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. After being trained on normal data, the networks are used to predict interested steps in time series. The difference between the predicted values and observed values is calculated as prediction errors. Then we use a kernel estimator of the quantile function to compute a threshold, which is used to determine anomalous observations. The performance of proposed method is illustrated through an example of anomaly detection of consumer demand in supply chain management. The numerical experiment shows that our approach achieve a higher level of detection accuracy and a lower percentage of false alarm rate compared to the previous One-Class Support Vector Machine method. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

In order to realize the optimal scheduling and automatic identification of port logistics service supply chain information, it is necessary to design the contract coordination management of port logistics service supply chain information. A coordinated management model of port logistics service supply chain information contract based on grid area reconstruction learning clustering is proposed. The fuzzy association rule scheduling technology is used to sample the port logistics service supply chain information, and the port logistics service supply chain information collected by RFID is processed by information fusion. The autocorrelation statistical regression analysis method is used to extract the correlation statistical features of port logistics service supply chain information, and the matching filtering method is used to detect the redundant features of port logistics service supply chain information for interference suppression filtering. The purified port logistics service supply chain information is reconstructed by phase space reconstruction technology, and the reconstructed data is classified and identified by grid area reconstruction learning clustering classifier. The contract coordination management and automatic retrieval of port logistics service supply chain information are realized. The simulation results show that the automatic classification of port logistics service supply chain information contract coordination management is good, and the fuzzy clustering ability is strong, which improves the coordination management ability of port logistics service supply chain information contract. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.},

abstract={As enterprises pay more and more attention to environmental issues, the green supply chain management (GSCM) mode has been extensively utilized to guarantee profit and sustainable development. Green supplier selection (GSS), which is a key segment of GSCM, has been investigated to put forward plenty of GSS approaches. At present, enterprises prefer to construct the large-scale teams of decision makers to obtain the more reasonable ranking results during GSS process. However, the existing methods pay little attention to the large-scale GSS procedure. To investigate the GSS issue with a large-scale group of decision makers, a new GSS approach under a q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy environment is developed. The q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy numbers are introduced to describe the evaluation information of green suppliers. Combined with a clustering approach and several clustering principles, the large-scale decision makers are divided into several subgroups. Next, the similarity measures between the evaluation matrices are computed to determine the weights of subgroups, and the collective evaluation information can be obtained using the q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy aggregation operator. According to the weighted entropy measure, the weights of criteria are calculated; then, the q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form (q-RIVOF-MULTIMOORA) method is constructed to determine the best green supplier. At last, a practical GSS example is applied to show the feasibility of the proposed approach, and the sensitivity and comparative analyses indicate that for the large-scale GSS issues, the proposed approach can obtain the more robust and reasonable ranking results. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: A number of governments are making building information modeling (BIM) a mandatory requirement for all public works construction projects. While main contractors may be ready to comply with such requirements, the supply chain as whole may be vulnerable as lower-tier suppliers may not be able to adopt BIM. There is currently no objective approach to assessing BIM maturity; hence, this paper aims to develop a new approach to determine suppliers’ current vision and execution-based capabilities to exploit BIM and their capacity to reach a higher maturity level. Design/methodology/approach: Based on UK Government BIM maturity levels, the authors exploit a unique data set made available by a main contractor, to determine a data-driven approach, using K-means, to assess the capabilities and vision of its supply base. Findings: The authors find a direct comparison between our suggested K-means clusters and the UK Government’s BIM maturity levels. However, in interrogating specific cases, the authors find that using a subjective approach would have wrongly categorized certain companies. The authors also determine what capability and strategic developments are required for companies to move to a higher level. Research limitations/implications: The method aligns with the existing UK BIM maturity model and enhances the model by determining the likelihood of a supplier in progressing to a higher level of maturity. The research was with a single case company, exploiting their existing survey instrument and data. A more comprehensive study could be adopted with a generic survey questionnaire. Practical implications: The research may be exploited by companies to take a strategic approach to assess suppliers in BIM adoption and to establish supplier development mechanisms. Originality/value: The data-driven approach avoids ambiguity of categories and mis-categorizing suppliers. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The vehicle routing problem is a problem of combinatorial optimization and operational research, which has been largely studied for many years, as well as its variants. With the increased distribution of product and service flows, many logistics applications increasingly requires customers to be grouped into clusters that facilitate delivery or any processing upstream or downstream of customers. In this article, we propose an approach using the known problem of generalized vehicle routing (GVRP) which is an extension of the problem of vehicle routing (VRP) and the problem of split delivery vehicle routing (SDVRP). The GVRP handles a set of clients grouped into separate groups, while the SDVRP allowed for split deliveries. The constraint that each customer must be visited only once is then removed. In this article, using a simple example and combining the two previous methods, we give an illustration of the problem of multisplit delivery. This example presents the new concept of problems of clustered vehicle routings that overlap with multisplit deliveries. This can be considered as an extension of previous work. We also give a mathematical formulation of this type of problem. A two-level variant will be presented, and we propose an algorithm inspired by those proposed in the references. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the last years, a new developed paradigm known as Physical Internet (PI) has been appeared, and studied in logistics management. The purpose of this global and open system is to deal with logistics grand challenge by setting up an efficient and sustainable Logistics Web. Methodology and approach: The purpose of this paper is to review of scientific articles dedicated to Physical Internet topic, and to provide a clustering strategy enabling to classify the literature on the Physical Internet, to follow its evolution, as well as to criticize it. The classification is based on three factors: Logistics Web, organization, and resources. Results: Several papers about Physical Internet have been classified and analyzed along the Logistics Web, resources and organization views at a strategic, tactical and operational level, respectively. A developed cluster analyses shows that Physical Internet needs more studies and more analyses to be adopted. Outcomes: The Physical Internet system has attracted several researchers in the last 4 years, and since then more articles have been published. However, this topic is still on papers and it needs more practice. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The contradiction between the contribution of city logistics (CL) to sustainable urban development and its negative externalities is increasingly prominent. Policy supervision measures and the green logistics initiative are also in conflict with the management goal of logistics enterprises. Innovative solutions for CL have attracted increasing research attention worldwide. However, the description of the global research network in the field of CL, research trends, and the discussion of advanced theories and practices have not been systematically reviewed so far. Especially in the past three years, there has been an explosive growth of relevant literature. In this paper, the method of combining scientometric analysis and thematic discussion was adopted to systematically review 513 important works in the literature from 1993 to 2018, aiming to provide a holistic understanding of the status in quo, trends and gaps of CL research, and to further analyze prominent problems. The study has made statistical analyses of the publication year profile, journal allocation and research methods of the included literature, and constructed four kinds of visualized bibliographic information timeline maps for the authorship network, international collaboration network, keywords co-occurrence network and research topic clustering. Then, the three themes summarized by clustering are discussed, mainly focusing on CL strategies and policy, green supply chain management, planning methods, and advanced concepts and practices. Finally, the research gaps framework and agenda were reported. This study contributes to summarizing the research and development of city logistics on the whole, and can also serve as an explorative manual to support sustainable urban freight activities and innovative research. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={This research aims to provide important insights regarding the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the world's largest food producing countries based on four sustainability metrics: energy use, carbon footprint, value-added and compensation of employees by low, medium and high-skill groups. World Input-Output Database is used as a detailed and intercountry and sector economic database. To compare the results between global databases, Eora and EXIOBASE are also used for comparative analysis. Three statistical analysis techniques such as Mann-Kendal trend test, matching index and k-means clustering algorithm are applied to provide a further insight from the analysis. The results are presented for three categories: regional on-site, regional supply chain, and global supply chain. The agriculture industry has the largest environmental footprints in food supply chains. Based on the Mann-Kendall trend test, there is a statistically significant trend in carbon, energy, and employment indicators. The maximum value of the matching–index of the overall impact (0.92) is achieved between the EXIOBASE and WIOD databases. China and USA are positioned in different clusters based on total sustainability performance when using different MRIO databases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={To successfully reduce environmental emissions, companies need to expand the scope of their emissions accounting to include entire supply chains. A clustering approach has been used to find emission-intensive industry clusters. However, this approach did not include entire direct and indirect supply chains when forming high emission industry clusters. We propose a new method based on a modified normalized cut function with Leontief’s input–output model and basic clustering algorithms to find industry clusters with high levels of embodied within-cluster emissions that are well separated in the supply chain network. We use this method to identify 58 carbon-intensive clusters of Japanese industries and visualize the within-cluster supply chains in terms of embodied carbon flows. We recommend that companies collaborate within clusters to reduce environmental emissions. Our results provide new insights on where to target emissions reduction actions and technology development within industrial supply chains. © 2018, © 2018 The International Input–Output Association.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to address the potential impacts of Industry 4.0 on human resource management (HRM) – with a particular focus on employment, job profile and qualification and skill requirements in the workforce – which can have implications for supply chain management (SCM). Consequently, exploratory relationships among Industry 4.0, HRM and SCM are presented based on a systematic review. Design/methodology/approach: To explore Industry 4.0 literature and its impact on employment, the authors used a systematic literature review to identify, classify and analyze current knowledge, flagging trends and proposing recommendations for future research in this area. Using the Web of Science database, the authors utilized co-citation software to visualize the networks which emerged from recurrent terms and which were then used to develop the categories of analysis. Findings: The authors can affirm that the literature in this field is in a transition process, from the early studies of German academics to the current development of new impacts worldwide. Industry 4.0 is the central theme of the literature analyzed and is accomplished through the development of employment, qualifications, skills and learning frameworks. The results reveal that most papers are conceptual, with quantitative studies still lacking. Developed countries have a leading role in terms of research production, while Latin America and Asia are far behind. Clustering reveals four dominant themes (educational changes, employment scenario, work infrastructure resources and work meaning and proposal). The first refers to labor changes around working conditions, the work environment and new skills which are required. The second main theme concerns the potentially unstable shift in the labor market has toward a high-level context. The third is about the technical interface of humans and machines, and finally, the fourth understands the German industry as a starting point for global industrial improvements and work proposal changes. Furthermore, socio-technical systems cover the implications of HRM for SCM in three different dimensions: qualification and education (human competences), collaboration and integration of SCM (organizational competences) and data and information management (technical competences). Research limitations/implications: An original research agenda for further development of the topic. Additionally, the implications of the findings for SCM practitioners are presented. Practical implications: SCM managers can benefit from the results of this paper by developing adjusted polices for organizational and human aspects. Specially about training programs to improve technology skills and education programs for cyber-human new plataforms. Originality/value: So far, Industry 4.0, HRM-related topics and implications for SCM have generally been considered separately. This paper elucidates the few important studies on the impacts of Industry 4.0 on human-related topics, such as the labor market, building a research framework using the main contributions highlighted in the literature. An original research agenda is presented, as well as potential implications for SCM. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Supply chain management first needs to solve the location problem of distribution center of logistics. At present, the application of the centre-of-gravity method to calculate site selection is relative extensive. Based on the method of extreme distance calculation in the field of data mining technology, a new supply chain distribution center selection method combined with clustering algorithm and the centre-of-gravity selection method was proposed in this paper. In order to avoid the limitation of the traditional centre-of-gravity algorithm, the geographical location price was added to the optimization algorithm as the weight value, and the total cost of the model was calculated; then a “three-segment” data mining clustering algorithm was given to improve the efficiency of clustering calculation and avoid isolation finally, the K-means algorithm, the optimized three-segment algorithm and the hierarchical clustering algorithm and so on were compared, and the simulation calculation was carried out. It can be found that the algorithm of clustering center of gravity of the extreme distance data mining can reduce the cost and is advantageous to solve the problem of the location of the supply chain logistics center of gravity location. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an analytical model for low carbon supplier development. This study is focused on the level of investment and collaboration decisions pertaining to emission reduction. Design/methodology/approach: The authors’ model includes a fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm and a fuzzy formal concept analysis. First, a set of suppliers were classified according to their carbon performances through the FCM clustering algorithm. Then, the fuzzy formal concepts were derived from a set of fuzzy formal contexts through an intersection-based method. These fuzzy formal concepts provide the relative level of investments and collaboration decisions for each identified supplier cluster. A case from the Indian renewable energy sector was used for illustration of the proposed analytical model. Findings: The proposed model and case illustration may help manufacturing firms to collaborate with their suppliers for improving their carbon performances. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the low carbon supply chain management literature by identifying the decision criteria of investments toward low carbon supplier development. It also provides an analytical model of collaboration for low carbon supplier development. Though the purpose of the study is to illustrate the proposed analytical model, it would have been better if the model was empirically validated. Originality/value: Though the earlier studies on green supplier development program evaluation have considered a set of criteria to decide whether or not to invest on suppliers, these are silent on the relative level of investment required for a given set of suppliers. This study aims to fulfill this gap by providing an analytical model that will help a manufacturing firm to invest and collaborate with its suppliers for improving their carbon performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Farmers adopting and implementing innovations, such as new technologies and new products, often require “collaborative inter-segment innovation” by other actors in other segments of the value chain, such as wholesalers implementing new product innovations such as supply of commercial fish feed and chemicals and buying and marketing non-traditional fish species. We tested whether the clustering, and thus economies of agglomeration with implied lower transaction costs, encourage and facilitate farmers to innovate. That potential determinant of farmer choices has not been studied in agriculture or aquaculture or indeed the food sector. We use a unique data set from our own primary survey of the aquaculture value chain in Bangladesh, including micro data for 1500 fish farm households and 20 districts (77 villages) for meso level data. We calculate an index to include both horizontal agglomeration and vertical interconnections among actors in the value chain. We find being in an area with a high clustering index is associated with a higher probability of farmers using more modern inputs and growing non-traditional commodity fish species, controlling for farmers’ other characteristics as well as proximity to cities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Industrial Clusters (ICs) are companies that are active in the same commercial section in adjacent geographical area. Several articles have investigated the mathematical structure of ICs under different business rules and objectives. However, There is a dearth of research in mathematical relationship between Supply Chain Management and ICs. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-echelon supply-distribution model that optimize collaborations of different echelons. The two considered objectives are minimizing the total incurred logistics costs, and maximizing the service level of customers. We solve this problem using the intelligent water drops (IWD) algorithm. We also compare IWD with reference-point based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) and non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA). Finally, we illustrate the validity of the proposed approach through experimental results. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Large-scale group decision making (LGDM) is becoming more and more common, and how to assure the security and quality of the decision process has become a hot topic. Supply chain risk mitigation is a LGDM problem which involves many stakeholders. In the decision making process, a group of experts aims at reaching a consensus among alternatives in which non-cooperative behaviors often appear. Some experts might designedly form a small alliance and change their preferences in a direction against consensus with the aim to foster the alliance's own interests. In this study, we present a novel large-scale consensus reaching framework based on a self-management mechanism to manage non-cooperative behaviors. In the proposed framework, experts are classified into different subgroups using a clustering method, and they provide their evaluation information, i.e., the multi-criteria mutual evaluation matrices (MCMEMs), regarding the obtained subgroups based on their performance. The subgroups' weights are generated dynamically from the MCMEMs, which are in turn used to update experts' weights. This self-management mechanism allows penalizing the weights of the experts with non-cooperative behaviors. Detailed comparison analysis is presented to verify the validity of the proposed consensus framework. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Given the rapid diversification of products in the textile and apparel industry, manufacturers face significant new challenges in production. The life cycle of apparel products has contracted and is now, generally, a several-week season, during which time a majority of products are supposed to be sold. Products that do not sell well may be sold at a price lower than the fixed price, and products that do not sell at all within the sales period may eventually become forced disposal. This creates long-term management and environmental problems. In practice, shipping personnel determine when to ship products to stores after reviewing product sales information. However, they may not schedule or structure these shipments properly because they cannot effectively monitor sales for a large number of products. In this paper, shipment is considered to reduce the risk of product disposal on the premise of selling at a fixed price. Although shipment quantities are determined by various factors, we only consider the change in inventory at the logistics warehouse, since it is difficult to incorporate all factors into the analysis. From cluster analysis, it is found that shipping personnel should recognize a policy to sell products gradually over time. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of disposal, we forecast the inventory from conditional probability and are able to extract products out of a standard grouping using past data. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Regional competitiveness can be improved by providing value-added services, such as transport and logistics services to both the local and global supply chains. Transport and logistics clusters have been shown to reduce trade transactions and to improve the efficiency of both local and international transactions. The aim of this study was to identify the sectors that comprise the transport and logistics cluster and to determine the cluster's associated economy-wide effects. Using a cross-sectional study design, location-specific competitive advantages and economic multipliers associated with the clustering of transport and logistics companies were computed for the North-West Province in South Africa. Findings illustrate that the transport and logistics cluster comprises seven sectors that associate positively with upstream and downstream multipliers in various sectors within the region. Additionally, the sectors in the cluster are relatively integrated and have high interlinkages. The cluster has potential for higher levels of integration once the cluster is strengthened. In the context of South Africa, this implies that transport and logistics cluster optimisation has a knock on effect on various industries including tourism as shown elsewhere. This study offers a unique econometric approach to identify and quantify the effects of transport and logistics clusters on regional competitiveness and provides practitioners and policy makers with insights into alternative strategies to enhance regional competitiveness and growth. © 2019 Editura Universitatii din Oradea.

abstract={Prefabricated construction (PC) have attracted increasing research attention worldwide due to their advantages such as high construction efficiency, short construction period, low labor cost and low energy consumption. Supply chain management is closely related to the application efficiency of PC, but only in the last three years has this interdisciplinary research received due attention. The global research network in the field of prefabricated construction supply chain management (PCSCM) have not been systematically reviewed so far. Especially in the recent three years, there has been an explosive growth of relevant literature. In this paper, the method of combining scientometrics analysis and thematic discussion was adopted to systematically review 152 important literatures from 2001 to 2018, aiming to provide a holistic understanding of the status in quo, trends and gaps of PCSCM research, and further analyze the prominent problems. The study constructed four kinds of visualized bibliographic information maps for the publication distribution across journals, co-occurrence of keywords, co-authorship analysis, and citation of articles. Then, the four themes summarized by clustering were discussed, mainly focusing on strategic research and project evaluation, PC supply chain process design and optimization, supply chain integration and management, and application of advanced technology. Finally, the research gaps and conceptual development framework to promote PCSCM were reported. This study contributes to grasping the research and development of PCSCM on the whole, and can also serve as an explorative manual to support PCSCM activities and innovative research. © 2019, Success Culture Press.

abstract={According to the age of market globalization, the concept of big data has become very vast and it is covering all the fields including the business. In business management the concept of supply chain is an important segment. The chain supplyadministration popularly known as SCM. SCM is anadministration of services and goods flow. It encompasseslocomotion and stockpiling of raw materials, of work-in-progressaccount& of completebelongings from origin to said consumption point. In the whole process a large capacity of information is created, which leads to data management issues. This heap of information is known as “big data”. The data management techniques include different methods like data clustering, classification, association analysis, regression. In the current era there are a lot of researches are going on resolving the issues of big data management. Here some of the issues are discussed. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Sales forecasting is even more vital for supply chain management in e-commerce with a huge amount of transaction data generated every minute. In order to enhance the logistics service experience of customers and optimize inventory management, e-commerce enterprises focus more on improving the accuracy of sales prediction with machine learning algorithms. In this study, a C-A-XGBoost forecasting model is proposed taking sales features of commodities and tendency of data series into account, based on the XGBoost model. A C-XGBoost model is first established to forecast for each cluster of the resulting clusters based on two-step clustering algorithm, incorporating sales features into the C-XGBoost model as influencing factors of forecasting. Secondly, an A-XGBoost model is used to forecast the tendency with the ARIMA model for the linear part and the XGBoost model for the nonlinear part. The final results are summed by assigning weights to forecasting results of the C-XGBoost and A-XGBoost models. By comparison with the ARIMA, XGBoost, C-XGBoost, and A-XGBoost models using data from Jollychic cross-border e-commerce platform, the C-A-XGBoost is proved to outperform than other four models.

abstract={In view of the complex network characteristics of cluster supply chain, this paper studies the core enterprise identification method of cluster supply chain. Combining complex network theory with supply chain management idea, complex network model and complex network topology structure of cluster supply chain were created. From the aspects of network topology properties and business operation for enterprise nodes, the evaluation index system of core enterprise node importance was established in cluster supply chain complex network. Based on machine learning theory, the identification algorithm of core enterprise nodes in cluster supply chain complex network was proposed by an improved iterative self-organizing data analysis algorithm and K-means clustering algorithm. The simulation results verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

abstract={Accurate forecasting of a high variability time series has relevance in many applications such as supply-chain management, price prediction in stock markets and demand forecasting in the energy segment. Most often forecasts of such time series depend on many factors ranging from weather to socio-economic attributes such as GDP or average income. Dependence on such features can cause the underlying time series to be highly variable in nature and possess non-stationary shifts. Most traditional forecasting methods fail to capture such trend shifts and high variability present in the data. Further, for certain applications, it may be necessary to estimate the confidence of the forecasts. In this work, we propose two variants of recurrent mixture density network (RMDN), for time series forecasting, that have the ability to handle high-dimensional input features, capture trend shifts and high variability present in the data, and provide a confidence estimate of the forecast. To this end, we first pass the high-dimensional time series data through a feedforward layer, which performs dimensionality reduction or feature selection in an unsupervised manner by inducing sparsity on the weights of the feedforward layer. The resultant low-dimensional time series is then fed through recurrent layers to capture temporal patterns. These recurrent layers also aid in learning the latent representation of the input data. Thereafter, a mixture density network (MDN) is used to model the variability and trend shifts present in the input and it also estimates the confidence of the predictions. The models are trained in an end-to-end fashion and the efficacy of the proposed models is demonstrated on three publicly available datasets from energy markets. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={For achieving the sustainable consumption and production, designers and manufacturers should provide inexpensive products that create a low environmental load on the user. Accordingly, products and their components should exhibit a modular design, which can be achieved by considering some factors such as future reuse, remanufacturing, and upgrading. Modular design methods primarily focus to reduce the lead time or costs associated with designing an entire family of products. However, resource efficiency is an important consideration associated with reuse as well as with the production and procurement stages of manufacturing. Hence, proper supplier selection is crucial because new products comprise several components and modules supplied by various manufacturers. So, this paper proposes a modular design method and strategy based on supply chain management. Especially, the proposed method evaluates a modular design strategy based on the cost, environmental load in transportation, quality, and procurement lead time. After deriving modular architecture candidates by Design Structure Matrix clustering that divide functionally closer parts into groups, a proposed indicator is used to evaluate the efficiency of the candidates based on the modular architectures and suppliers. This study applies the proposed method to design a laptop computer and derives an appropriate modular architecture and suppliers with respect to each destination. © 2019 Penerbit Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is twofold. First, to explore and classify factors influencing traceability implementation, and second, to cluster essential traceability-related information that demands recording and sharing with businesses and customers, in the context of the textile and clothing supply chain. A Delphi study is conducted with 23 experts (including research practitioners and industry experts) to explore, validate, and classify traceability factors and related information using distribution analyses and hierarchal clustering. As a result, 14 factors and 19 information sets are identified and classified with a moderately high agreement among the experts. Among these, risk management, product authentication, and visibility are the highest ranked and the most important factors influencing traceability implementation in the textile and clothing supply chain. While origin, composition, and sustainability-related information are crucial for sharing with customers, the information vital to businesses includes manufacturer/supplier details, product specifications, and composition. It is noteworthy that this research is among the few that classifies traceability factors and information through expert perspectives, and it creates decisive knowledge of traceability for the textile and clothing supply chain. It further provides insights on the extent to which this information can be shared among supply chain actors. Outcomes of this study can be helpful for the development of an information traceability framework. Policymakers can use the results to draft traceability guidelines/regulations, whilst top management can develop traceability-related strategies. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Information systems (IS) impact supply chain management (SCM) on processes such as planning, sourcing, and delivering, and at levels ranging from tactical operations to organisational strategy. The vast scope of IS and SCM relationships have resulted in diverse and disintegrated research on the topic. This paper offers a systematic literature analysis at the intersection of supply chain and information systems (SCIS), aiming to provide a classification for existing areas of research. This research is based on an analysis of more than 1500 articles published in peer-reviewed journals over the past four decades to classify topics and methods and to identify major trends and distinguish important research themes. The classification of the literature has identified major clusters of research in SCIS, and suggestions are made for future research in each of the identified clusters. In general, the findings point out that there is a dearth of research on topics such as ‘impact of IT on vertical disintegration of supply chains,’ ‘implications of new technologies for supply chains,’ and ‘concerns related to trust, governance, ownership, privacy, and security of data in supply chains.’ This work provides both researchers and practitioners with an insightful description of the current state of research in SCIS and related future trends in research and practice. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Prosperity and economic growth require robust specialization and exchange. This means the formation and maintenance of numerous complex supply chains. These are emergent and include supply chains for things and supply chains for ideas. The former involve transactions; the latter can be via transactions and/or realized positive externalities. All supply chains have a geographic dimension which is also emergent. Firms carefully choose what to make vs what to buy and also where to sell or buy it, near or far. The whole system tends to be a pattern of locations that denote realized transactions (and transactions costs) as well as realized externalities. The city remains a competitive producer if these relationships are encouraged with the attendant costs contained. Cities are “engines of growth.” They offer attractive supply chain formation and management opportunities, including the various spatially situated supply chains for things and ideas. The latter are more complex than textbook discussions of non-rival goods suggest. People are keen to identify and acquire useful knowledge. Consider (1) the advantages of open-source knowledge sharing have been acknowledged; (2) ideas often denote complex tacit knowledge exchange, and (3) access to useful knowledge is priced in land markets and impacts location choice. Favorable networking and location opportunities are significant. Flexible land markets facilitate the availability of such opportunities. Access to pools of human capital is clearly beneficial, but the ability to tailor access to the peculiar requirements of the firm is even better. Detailed firm location data for various sectors for the Los Angeles metropolitan areas are analyzed to support our claims. We estimate Ripley k-functions and note differences by industry as well as firm size. There is agglomeration that is near as well as far. This finding complicates “death of distance” as well as “clustering” discussions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Supply chain processes need stability and predictability for the supply to better match demand at the right time with the right quantity. Reaching stable operations under uncertainty, however, is challenging as fluctuating demand patterns in the downstream are so common and make inventory control at the upstream a daunting task. Working with one of the leading semiconductor distributors in the world, who piles up stock that hampers profitability for the sake of satisfying lumpy/erratic demand in the downstream production plants, we help the distributor track process variability in its operations. Specifically, we integrate unsupervised clustering with the recurrent neural network for tracking supply chain process variability without pre-Assumptions on demand patterns. We first apply unsupervised learning techniques to characterize weekly process performance of a wide variety of electronic items, where item-week pairs that have relatively-high similarity on values of demand and stock attributes are clustered together. The operational variability of each item can then be measured with the trajectory of the item on its clusters ordered by time. To predict the trajectory of how each item moves from week to week, we propose a new cluster sequence encoding and employ the recurrent neural network structure for sequence prediction. We show that with a training loss function tailored to our encoding scheme, the presented approach can achieve high accuracy on variability prediction for real-world data. Since any upstream supply operations are driven by downstream demand patterns, the prediction on items' operational variability may help suppliers to better prepare for demand irregularities by dynamically adjusting their operations strategies, e.g., altering throughput rates, rescheduling deliveries, increasing/decreasing fulfillment frequencies, etc. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In the context of today 's pattern of globalization and a huge amount of information, a smart supply management chain is required. Naturally, statistics and operations research are used for optimizing supply and demand objectives. However, the new context brings out new opportunities at descriptive, predictive and prescriptive levels for supply chain network design, logistics and distribution and strategic sourcing. The key question is still how to capture and to use information. One striking example can be taken from social media, where their use allow to gain insight into the perception of consumers and to capture a real time overview of consumer reactions, regarding one or more specific events. In this regard, different modern approaches, such as IoT or Quantum neural network, are developed. In the same line of thought, we propose an analytic approach, based on KNN, Logistic Regression and SVM with the use of Twitter data in chicken supply chain management. Results identify the main concerns related to chicken products and allow to the development of a consumer-centric supply chain. The proposed approach can be extended to other topics such as anomaly detection and codification of customer intelligence. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

abstract={This study combined the input-output clustering analysis and structural path betweenness analysis, and identified critical sectors belonging to important emission clusters in the global supply chain networks associated with final demand of transport equipment in five countries (United States, China, Germany, Japan, and France). Clustering analysis can divide the groups constructing the strong connecting supply chain with large emissions from the global supply chain network, and structural path betweenness represents how much CO2 emissions from the supply chain paths a sector has in global supply chain network. I applied the combined method to the EORA database which covers 189 countries and focused on the whole global supply chain networks in detail. The results demonstrate that the global supply chain networks of transport equipment were well separated into emission clusters with higher emissions that consist of sectors with higher structural path betweenness. Chinese emission clusters were identified from the global supply chain networks for the five countries in question and the betweenness of Chinese sectors tend to be higher values in the supply chain networks. In this study, I suggested supply chain management of high priority sectors for a reduction in CO2 emissions of transport equipment in the producing countries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper was to align integrative tactics and coordination program to develop a supply chain integration process. The taxonomy approach was employed in this paper. An empirical sample comprising 655 responses to the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey was used to test the research question. This paper identified an integrative process that entailed four steps: initial integration, basic integration, junior integration, and senior integration. In addition, the research results show which integrative tactic should be improved, and how they should be improved, in each step, as well as which coordination program should be implemented in each step to expedite integration. Finally, the research results show changes in competitive capabilities between the steps. In terms of practical implications, our research results can be used as a guideline for practitioners to develop a stepwise process of integration and to gradually improve and expand integration until complete integration is achieved. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: Through examining the two constructs of inter-organizational complementarity and inter-organizational compatibility in supply chains, the purpose of this paper is to develop a taxonomy of focal firms’ inter-organizational fit (IOF) configurations with their suppliers and customers, and examine the relationship between these configurations and environmental innovation (EI) in order to answer the question of “with whom” to collaborate for EI development. Design/methodology/approach: A survey instrument was elaborated and data from a sample of 171 US firms were collected. The authors adopted cluster analysis to identify the IOF taxonomy. Canonical discriminant analysis was employed to uncover underlying dimensions between clustering variables and cluster membership. Then, ANOVA tests were conducted to investigate relationships between IOF configurations in the context of EI in supply chains. Findings: Three configurations were identified based on the complementarity and compatibility between focal firms and their supply chain partners. It is observed that the overall IOF level is positively related to firms’ EI outcomes. Moreover, inter-organizational complementarity facilitates incremental EI while inter-organizational compatibility plays a more crucial role in radical EI. Both are required to achieve the best innovation outcome. Originality/value: This research develops the first taxonomy for depicting IOF in a supply chain innovation context and also clarifies different rationale behind the development of incremental and radical EI through examining distinctive effects of the complementarity and compatibility with supply chain partners. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the characteristic role of specialized markets and traders in the internationalization of emerging economies by examining the linkages between supply chain management (SCM) and industrial clustering in China. Design/methodology/approach: Multi-method approach was employed as primary data were collected from a case study of Shaoxing textile cluster, and was supplemented with secondary data to triangulate the findings. The proposition that competitive advantages of industrial clusters facilitate effective SCM was explored. Findings: The authors reveal that China’s cost advantage is manifested in the entire value chain. The provision of business friendly amenities as a result of synergetic benefits of vertical and horizontal integration of supply clusters promotes competitiveness of SMEs and region as a whole. Moreover, specialized markets and international traders found to play significant role in sustainable cluster development. Research limitations/implications: As with fieldwork and case studies, generalization should be drawn with care. Systematic synthesis of relevant case studies is recommended. Practical implications: The study endorses the construction of local supply chains and suggests implementation of cluster strategy by focusing on environment-specific execution of triple helix model. Originality/value: The article elaborates the linkages between cluster theory and SCM both within cluster and between interspersed clusters. It also explains how specialized markets and global players are enabling concentrated supply networks. The paper recommends extension of “Triple helix + 1 model” by making local community part of the underlying framework. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper proposes a big-data analytics-based approach that considers social media (Twitter) data for the identification of supply chain management issues in food industries. In particular, the proposed approach includes text analysis using a support vector machine (SVM) and hierarchical clustering with multiscale bootstrap resampling. The result of this approach included a cluster of words which could inform supply-chain (SC) decision makers about customer feedback and issues in the flow/quality of food products. A case study in the beef supply chain was analysed using the proposed approach, where three weeks of data from Twitter were used. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Supply chain management is monitoring of activities involved in supply chain, for integrating and coordinating between suppliers, manufacturing, inventory and transportation both within and among members. The ultimate aim of supply chains is to reduce costs and increase market coverage. Procuring and purchasing requested items in a timely manner are the two most important issues for supply chain stockholders. Group purchasing is one of the purchasing strategies in supply chains. It offers great potential by ordering large volumes to decrease expenses which can increase services to customers. A clustering optimization approach is employed to model group purchasing for a set of pharmacies in the field of healthcare. The proposed model determines a cooperation strategy based on factors such as distance between pharmacies and procurement expenditure in this network. Moreover, the proposed multi-objective group purchasing model is optimized using both goal programming and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. To illustrate the application of the proposed model, designing a purchasing group organization for Chalus city pharmacies is investigated. Purchasing groups are established in the way that sum of pharmacies ordering quantity has been located in the second or the third level of discount rate. Thus, the results show that GPOs can take the advantage of this cooperation. © 2017, SBMAC - Sociedade Brasileira de Matemática Aplicada e Computacional.},

abstract={The continuously growing amount of available data has accelerated the emergence of numerous business intelligence applications that are summarized under the term Big Data Analytics (BDA). BDA is especially relevant to the domain of Supply Chain Management (SCM) as it provides the tools to support decision-making in increasingly global, volatile and dynamic value networks. However, its application challenges traditional institutional arrangements as well as roles that are related to the management of data. The underlying empirical study addresses this challenge with the application of a multi-method approach that is embedded in Organizational Information Processing Theory (OIPT). A Delphi survey was conducted to integrate expert assessments of projections up to the year 2035 and fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to identify future scenarios that span the future of BDA in SCM. The study suggests that BDA will improve demand forecasts, reduce safety stocks and improve the management of supplier performance. However, supply chain (SC) processes will become increasingly automated and traditional tasks of SCM will be partially substituted as a result. Consequently, the transition of the traditional role of SCM within organizations will increase the importance of human intuition, trust and strategic decision-making. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Much of the North American wood products industry was severely impacted by the recession of 2008-2009. In addition, many sectors within this industry face intense global competition. Against this backdrop, we examine economic opportunities for hardwood manufacturers to achieve greater competitive advantage via product customization, through a literature review and synthesis. We also discuss several related themes including agility, lean manufacturing, and clustering. We found that, in globally competitive environments, hardwood producers must be agile to adapt to economic conditions and dynamic customer demand. We discuss how some sectors of the hardwood industry have effectively exhibited customized production, and subsequently fared relatively well in the current economy. We conclude the synthesis by evaluating the importance of supply chains to achieving customization for hardwood producers. In the future, supply chains will need to be configured to rapidly respond to changing consumer demands, and pressure to provide more services will likely extend further back up the supply chain to hardwood sawmills. It is expected that sustainability practices, including green supply chain management, will impact operational and economic performance of hardwood firms as well. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Supplier evaluation and selection is one of the most critical strategic decisions for developing a competitive and sustainable organization. Companies have to consider supplier related risks and threats in their purchasing decisions. In today's competitive and risky business environment, it is very important to work with reliable suppliers. This study proposes a clustering based approach to group suppliers based on their risk profile. Suppliers of a company in the heavy-machinery sector are assessed based on 17 qualitative and quantitative risk types. The weights of the criteria are determined by using the Best-Worst method. Four factors are extracted by applying Factor Analysis to the supplier risk data. Then k-means clustering algorithm is applied to group core suppliers of the company based on the four risk factors. Three clusters are created with different risk exposure levels. The interpretation of the results provides insights for risk management actions and supplier development programs to mitigate supplier risk. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={In past recent years, by increasing in the considerations on the significance of data science many studies have been developed concerning the big data structured problems. Along with the information science, in the field of decision science, multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches have been considerably applied in research studies. One of the most important procedures in supply chain management is selecting the optimal supplier to maintain the long-term productivity of the supply chain. There has been a vast amount of research which utilized MADM approaches to tackle the supplier selection problems, but only a few of these research considered big data structured problems. The current study presents a comprehensive novel approach for improving Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based on cluster analysis considering crisp big data structure input which is called CLUS-MCDA (Cluster analysis for improving Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis) algorithm. The proposed method is based on consolidating a data mining technique i.e. k-means clustering method and a MADM approach which is MULTIMOORA method. CLUS-MCDA method is a fast and practical approach which has been developed in this research which is implied in a supplier selection problem considering crisp big data structured input. A real-world case study in MAMUT multi-national corporation has been presented to show the validity and practicality of the CLUS-MCDA approach which calculated considering the business areas and criteria based on expert comments of mentioned organizations and previous literature on supplier selection problem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The local economic impact of shale gas extraction. Regional Studies. Advocates of UK shale gas expansion have focused upon predicted national economic benefits, but the local and/or regional impact has been largely neglected. This paper seeks to address this deficit by creating a unique dataset, combining industry data with consumer and supply-chain surveys, thereby overcoming the current absence of suitable secondary data. Local economic impact in the Bowland field is estimated via a simple Keynesian local-income multiplier model. Results emphasize the importance of facilitating local employment opportunities, through skills initiatives, and the development of regional supply chain clusters, to anchor economic benefits within the local economy. Policy implications are discussed. © 2017 Regional Studies Association.},

abstract={Our study examined relationships among pellet mills, bulk delivery companies, and high-efficiency pellet boiler equipment firms in northern New England as they relate to homeowner satisfaction, using social network analysis and the concept of supply chain management. The continual growth of supply and demand for automated pellet heating requires a careful match between innovative technologies and homeowner needs; these involve multiple factors and require collaboration among firms. Using interview data with managers from pellet mills, bulk delivery companies, and equipment firms in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, we found 15 firms that are connected through both a transaction network and an informal business interaction network. The networks were characterized by short paths and no obvious sign of centralization. Network statistics reported for each network included density, clustering coefficient, and degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality. Most firms in the supply networks shared customer satisfaction information (average number of information sending ties ¼ 3) and considered collaboration in customer services important (mean ¼ 4.4, on a 5-point scale). However, equipment firms initiated more information sharing than other types, and bulk delivery companies were in the best position in the supply network to promote collaborative customer services. Opportunities exist to improve communication between pellet mills and equipment firms, leading to a robust automated pellet heating supply chain, strong demand, and subsequent homeowner satisfaction. © Forest Products Society 2018.},

abstract={Since most supply chain processes include operational risks, the effectiveness of a corporation’s success depends mainly on identifying, analyzing and managing them. Currently, supply chain risk management (SCRM) is an active research field for enhancing a corporation’s efficiency. Although several techniques have been proposed, they still face a big challenge as they analyze only internal risk events from big data collected from the logistics of supply chain systems. In this paper, we analyze features that can identify risk labels in a supply chain. We propose defining risk events based on the association rule mining (ARM) technique that can categorize those in a supply chain based on a company’s historical data. The empirical results we obtained using data collected from an Aluminum company showed that this technique can efficiently generate and predict the optimal features of each risk label with a higher than 96.5% accuracy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={In order to enable the managers of manufacturing firms to envisage most of their organizational challenges and to assist them in providing a viable course of action, the decision making frameworks used by the management process is extremely helpful. Several quantitative and non-quantitative bases and models for decision making have been developed and used for this purpose. When criteria to be evaluated and available alternatives are multiple in nature, the process of decision making becomes complex and need to be addressed using special methods. Many Multi-criteria decision making techniques have been developed, including approaches of fuzzy logic, for solving such problems. This work presents a novel framework to monitor the performance of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of manufacturing firms by using fuzzy decision making techniques of Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Fuzzy TOPSIS and cluster analysis approaches. The work also shows how the personal creative power, experience and skills of experts (managers) in supply chain management are translated into objective decision making for strategy formulation. The study is exploratory in nature and is helpful to develop a procedure for categorising the OEMs of a sample firm (automobile manufacturing) on the basis of the measured performances scores. The OEMs are then categorised and grouped into clusters. Theses clusters represent the class of performance of the OEMs. Twenty OEMs were evaluated against twelve generic criteria. Distance based dynamic clustering technique, using small data set and K-mean clustering method are used to obtain a taxonomy of these OEMs. After finding priority scores of the OEMs, three taxons were obtained and labelled as "Prominents", "Intermediators" and "Marginals". These three groups illustrates the manufacturing strengths and weaknesses of these OEMs. Hence, three different strategies are formulated in order to improve the effectiveness of its supply chain management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Dizajn distributivne mreže predstavlja jednu od strateških odluka u konkurenciji za kompanije visokog uticaja. Optimalna lokacija objekata u odnosu na kapacitet ponude i potražnje omogucuje visokom nivou usluga prisustvo na tržištu. U ovom radu predstavljen je metodološki okvir za projektovanje distributivnih mreža kombinovanjem primene tehnika klastera i matematickog programiranja. Predložena metodologija je testirana sa realnim podacima dobijenim od kompanije bezalkoholnih pica u Kolumbiji. Pristup razmatra tri glavne faze. U prvoj fazi, proces klasteriranja kupaca vrši se pomocu K-sredstava kako bi se dobila lokacija za potencijalne distributivne centre (DC). U drugoj fazi, model za dizajn distributivne mreže se vrši pomocu mešovitog programiranja celih brojeva (MPCB) razmatrajuci razlicite opcije za dodeljivanje DC-ma. U finalnoj fazi vrši se procena predložene metodologije u realnom slucaju. Kao rezultat, definisana je distributivna šema koja omogucava ulaz u nova tržišna podrucja sa efikasnom strategijom za prodiranje proizvoda u velike gradove kao što je Bogota u Kolumbiji. © 2017 IJIEM Journal.
The Supply Network Design represents one of the high impact strategic decisions in competitiveness for companies. An optimal location of facilities in relation to the capacity of supply and demand, allows a high level service to attend the markets. In this paper, a methodological framework for designing supply networks by joining application of clustering techniques and mathematical programming are presented. The proposed methodology has been tested with real data obtained from a company of non-alcoholic beverages in Colombia. The approach considers three main stages. First, the costumers clustering process is performed by K-means in order to obtain the location for potential Distribution Centers (DC's). In the second stage, the model for supply network design is performed using a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) by considering different options to assign DC's, and finally the valuation of the proposed methodology on a real case.

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify how organizations can evaluate the green product deletion decision within an environmentally sustainable consumption and production environment through a hybrid multistage multiple criteria evaluation approach. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a decision-making model by integrating "soft computation" using neighborhood rough set theory, fuzzy cluster means, and cumulative prospect theory. Literature is used to identify various factors for the decision environment. An illustrative problem provides insights into the methodology and application. Findings - The results indicate that green products can be evaluated from both their relative environmental burdens and benefits. Sustainable consumption and production factors that play a role in this multifactor decision are identified. The results show that a comprehensive evaluation can capture an effective overall picture on which green product(s) to delete. Research limitations/implications - The opaqueness of the proposed methodology may cause less acceptance by management. The methodology made a number of assumptions related to the data. An actual application of the tool rather than just an illustrative example is needed. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is the novel integration of supply chain perspectives, both upstream (supply and production) and downstream (demand/usage), with green product deletion decision making. The hybrid multistage technique has advantages of being able to incorporate many factors that have a variety of quantitative and qualitative characteristics to help managers address green product deletion issues as well as its impact on greening of supply chains and organizational environmental sustainability. This paper adds value to product deletion, supply chain management, and sustainable production and consumption literatures. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This study aims to explore research and to identify research clusters on sustainable development by using bibliometric analysis. The sustainable development field is examined using the selected research articles. A co-citation unit is used to analyze the relationship between cited documents, and then science mapping is used to identify clusters in this relationship. The results show that there are four main distinct clusters, of which the most important concerns sustainable supply chains and logistics management. This cluster is then classified into five bunches of knowledge sources. These bunches illustrate the need for a trend in sustainability issues that includes a social dimension to balance economic and environmental dimensions for long-term development. There are logistics management and lean concepts that can be applied to sustainable development to move toward business sustainability. The future direction of sustainable business concerns economic values, environmental policy and stakeholder engagement for business opportunities. The contribution of this article is to identify trends in sustainable development by means of bibliometric analysis, to develop research in the future.

abstract={Supply chain management aims at delivering goods in the shortest time at the lowest possible price while ensuring the best possible quality and is now vital to the success of the online retail business. Executing effective warehouse site selection has been one of the key challenges in the development of a successful supply chain system. While some effective strategies for warehouse site selection have been identified by the domain experts based on their experiences, the emergence of new ways of collecting fine-grained supply chain data has enabled a new paradigm for warehouse site selection. Indeed, in this paper, we provide a data-smart approach for addressing the connected capacitated warehouse location problem (CCWL), which searches for the minimum total transportation cost of the warehouse network including supplier-warehouses shipping cost, warehouse-customer delivering cost and the cost of warehouse-warehouse inter-transportation. Specifically, we first design a sales distribution prediction model and evaluate the importance of customer logistic service utilities on online market sales demand for online retailers. Then, we propose the E&M algorithm to optimize warehouse locations continuously with much less computation cost. Moreover, the computation cost is further reduced through delivery demand based Hierarchical Clustering which reduces the problem size by grouping delivering cities with close locations. Finally, we validate the proposed method on real-world e-Commerce supply chain data and the selection effect of new warehouses is evaluated in terms of sales improvement with faster delivery and more effective inventory management. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Inventory data management deals with defining stock for any organization. An inventory data management system is used for guiding the stock management within the organization to reduce the wastage of stock along with the track of records which tend to meet the requirement of end user along with the change in demand which creates a huge response in supply chain management as well advantageous for an organization in production supply time and to keep flexible production schedule. This paper deals with inventory stock data management which concentrates on managing the data in terms of both Volume and Variety of data. As it is concentrated more on data classification and clustering in order to maintain the stock on demand basis which will help to control stock management in an effective way. This paper justifies an approach how data analytics helps in managing the stock data in supply chain environment. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={In the publication industry, three business strategies are commonly observed, namely the subscription-based strategy, ad-sponsored strategy, and mixed strategy. In order to obtain managerial insights into the three business strategies, we consider a supply chain in which a publisher sells a product such as newspaper and magazine to end-customers. Furthermore, the publisher may also sell advertisement space to advertisers. In such a supply chain, the publisher determines the optimal business strategy and corresponding prices and fees; the advertisers determine the amount of advertisement space to purchase from the publisher. We formulate a game-theory model of the above advertising service supply chain. Under this model, we first characterize each firm's equilibrium decisions under each business strategy. We then compare the publisher's profit under the three strategies to determine the publisher's optimal strategy. We show that when the fixed cost of the mixed strategy is sufficiently low, it is optimal for the publisher to adopt the mixed strategy irrespective of the number of advertisers. If the fixed cost of the mixed strategy is high, it is optimal for the publisher to adopt either the subscription-based or ad-sponsored strategy, depending on the other parameters' values. However, advertisers do not always obtain their highest profits under the publisher's optimal strategy. We show regions where the publisher and advertisers have conflicting incentives. Both the fixed cost of the mixed strategy and the number of advertisers turn out to be key factors that lead to incentive conflicts in the supply chain. © 2017 The Operational Research Society.},

abstract={Since customer attention is increasing due to growing customer health awareness, it is important for the perishable food supply chain to monitor food quality and safety. This study proposes a real-time monitoring system that utilizes smartphone-based sensors and a big data platform. Firstly, we develop a smartphone-based sensor to gather temperature, humidity, GPS, and image data. The IoT-generated sensor on the smartphone has characteristics such as a large amount of storage, an unstructured format, and continuous data generation. Thus, in this study, we propose an effective big data platform design to handle IoT-generated sensor data. Furthermore, the abnormal sensor data generated by failed sensors is called outliers and may arise in real cases. The proposed system utilizes outlier detection based on statistical and clustering approaches to filter out the outlier data. The proposed system was evaluated for system and gateway performance and tested on the kimchi supply chain in Korea. The results showed that the proposed system is capable of processing a massive input/output of sensor data efficiently when the number of sensors and clients increases. The current commercial smartphones are sufficiently capable of combining their normal operations with simultaneous performance as gateways for transmitting sensor data to the server. In addition, the outlier detection based on the 3-sigma and DBSCAN were used to successfully detect/classify outlier data as separate from normal sensor data. This study is expected to help those who are responsible for developing the real-time monitoring system and implementing critical strategies related to the perishable supply chain. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Taiwan's networking communication industry has had a clustering scale and a good position for collaboration in the global networking communication manufacturing network. This study considers whether Taiwan's networking communication industry can enhance its competitive advantage through supply chain management activities. In order to examine the relationships of supply chain collaboration value innovation, supply chain capability and competitive advantage, this research selects 74 firms and 465 questionnaires from the upstream, middle and downstream manufactures of Taiwan networking communication industry for research subjects, and uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to verify the theoretical model. Results show that the relationships among supply chain collaboration value innovation, supply chain capacity and competitive advantage can have a positive impact, and that supply chain capability is a full mediator. Moreover, supply chain echelons (upper, middle and downstream) have some moderating effects in these relationships. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This article aims to measure the integrated performance of the supply chain in a new perspective. A new model called PEMMcopula has been built, which can effectively measure the integrated performance and provide quantitative proofs for supply chain financing decisions. PEM-Mcopula model is built based on the penalty function and mixed copula function, using SCAD penalty function to recognize the non-significant copula. Two step parameter estimation is used, the first step is kernel density estimation on marginal distribution, and EM method is used for estimating the weight and dependent parameters in iteration in the second step. And an empirical analysis of auto industry is also included. The model can effectively measure the integrated performance and provide quantitative proofs for supply chain financing decision and risk control, which is an excellent quantitative model to make integrated performance evaluation and provide a new perspective for supply chain financing business of banks and other financial institutions. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={In recent years, supply chain risk management has captivated both academicians and business practitioners interest, due to increasing catastrophic events and supply chain disruptions. However, the risk management process is highly complex because of the stochastic and dynamic nature and ever growing complexity of supply chains. As the ultimate goal of most enterprises is generating and increasing revenues on the long run, it is valuable to know the effect of specific supply chain risk positions and risk management practices on company sales. In this paper, secondary data on supply chain risk is analyzed and the key risk management strategies responsible for increased company sales are revealed. The novelty of this paper lies in developing a quantifying data mining approach to provide a comprehensive understanding of supply chain risk management (SCRM) and pinpoint focus areas for revenue seeking enterprises. The results prove and showcase that our methodology is capable of providing actionable insights, which were previously unknown or unaddressed. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Industrial Clusters (ICs) are defined as geographically adjacent interconnected companies working together within the same commercial section which enjoy unusual competitive success in their field. The relationships between Supply Chain Management (SCM) and ICs have been imperfectly mathematically investigated, in spite of their intrinsic correlation. To bridge this gap, a bi-objective multi-echelon supply-distribution model is firstly proposed in this paper to optimize collaborations of different echelons. The considered problem is then solved using a recently introduced metaheuristic algorithm, the intelligent water drops (IWD) algorithm in terms of a multi-objective approach. The IWD is then compared with two well-known algorithms, reference-point based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) and non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm (NRGA). The two considered objectives are 1) minimizing the total incurred logistics costs, and 2) maximizing the service level of customers. The small-and-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) positioned in IC as manufacturers profit from using a 3PL-managed supply-demand hub in industrial cluster (SDHIC) as a public provider of warehousing and logistics services. The validity of the proposed approach is illustrated through experimental results including comprehensive statistical analysis on the three used measurement metrics. © 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

abstract={Recognizing construction assets (e.g., materials, equipment, labor) from point cloud data of construction environments provides essential information for engineering and management applications including progress monitoring, safety management, supply-chain management, and quality control. This study introduces a novel principal axes descriptor (PAD) for construction-equipment classification from point cloud data. Scattered as-is point clouds are first processed with downsampling, segmentation, and clustering steps to obtain individual instances of construction equipment. A geometric descriptor consisting of dimensional variation, occupancy distribution, shape profile, and plane counting features is then calculated to encode three-dimensional (3D) characteristics of each equipment category. Using the derived features, machine learning methods such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine are employed to determine class membership among major construction-equipment categories such as backhoe loader, bulldozer, dump truck, excavator, and front loader. Construction-equipment classification with the proposed PAD was validated using computer-aided design (CAD)-generated point clouds as training data and laser-scanned point clouds from an equipment yard as testing data. The recognition performance was further evaluated using point clouds from a construction site as well as a pose variation data set. PAD was shown to achieve a higher recall rate and lower computation time compared to competing 3D descriptors. The results indicate that the proposed descriptor is a viable solution for construction-equipment classification from point cloud data. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Currently, network perspective is rapidly becoming trends for representing and analyzing problems across all of the domains from natural science to engineering and management, with no exception in supply chain management. Treating supply chain system as a network give a good advantages since there are a lot of method in network theory that can be applied to give a quantitative measurement. In turns, by applying network theory in supply chain, analyst can come up with better description and representation of their supply chain. This study tried explore a concept of community structure in network theory to identify the groups of suppliers, manufactures, distributors, retailers and customer which is highly connected each other and at the same time get a valuable representation of the large supply chain network. We argued that supply chain network is differ from the common network in which the network analysis commonly works onto, thus the method for detecting community will also became different. Hence, in this paper we addressing a method for detecting community of highly connected firms in supply chain/supply chain network by grouping the node/firm based on their complete flow/chain or commodity flow for short. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Data mining applications in the food industry has until now expressed in many ways, on both technical and economic terms. The most important methodologies being used are clustering, classification, feature selection and outlier detection. The techniques commonly used in data mining are artificial neural networks, decision trees, k-means type algorithms, genetic algorithms, nearest neighbour method, and rule induction. Successful case studies of the implementation of these methodologies are fruit and vegetable classification, with special focus on apples, citrus, strawberries, table olives, onions etc. the same rationale is being followed for the evaluation of processed foodstuff. Efficient solutions have been provided for wine classification, based on organoleptic characteristics, fish and meat classification, as well as robotic harvesting. Finally, applications on supply chain management and e-commerce have provided significant solutions on issues of monitoring and evaluation of dynamically changing datasets. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={After decades of basic research and more promises than impressive applications, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to deliver benefits. A convergence of advances is motivating this new surge of AI development and applications. Computer capability as it has evolved from high throughput and high performance computing systems is increasing. AI models and operations research adaptations are becoming more mature, and the world is breeding big data not only from the web and social media but also from the Internet of Things. Organizations around the world have been realizing that there are substantial performance gains and increases in productivity for the use of AI and predictive analytics techniques. Their use is bringing a new era of breakthrough innovation and opportunities. This book, compiles research insights and applications in diverse areas such as manufacturing, supply chain management, pricing, autonomous vehicles, healthcare, ecommerce, and aeronautics. Using classical and advanced tools in AI such as deep learning, particle swarm optimization, support vector machines and genetic programming among others. This is a very distinctive book which discusses important applications using a variety of paradigms from AI and outlines some of the research to be performed. The work supersedes similar books that do not cover as diversified a set of sophisticated applications. The authors present a comprehensive and articulated view of recent developments, identifies the applications gap by quoting from the experience of experts, and details suggested research areas. Artificial Intelligence: Advances in Research and Applications guides the reader through an intuitive understanding of the methodologies and tools for building and modeling intelligent systems. The book's coverage is broad, starting with clustering techniques with unsupervised ensemble learning, where the optimal combination strategy of individual partitions is robust in comparison to the selection of an algorithmic clustering pool. This is followed by a case in a parallel-distributed simulator using deep learning for its configuration. Chapter Three presents a case for autonomous vehicles. Chapter Four discusses the novel use of genetic algorithms with support vector machines. Chapters Five through Thirteen focus on the applications. The book discusses how the use of AI can allow for productivity development and other benefits not just for businesses, but also for economies. Finally, you can find an interesting investigation of the "transhuman" dimension of AI. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to intend to help focal firms which are keen to develop a sustainable supply chain by identifying enablers, in knowing the interrelationships involved and in ranking the enablers. Design/methodology/approach: Interpretive structural modeling and fuzzy MICMAC were used for the modeling and clustering of the enablers and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process has been used for the ranking purpose. Findings: Awareness about sustainability incentives, pressure from stakeholders, support from supply chain partners and demand from customer for sustainable products were found very important for developing a sustainable supply chain. Research limitations/implications: This research will help practitioners to appreciate the importance of the enablers to focus on the making sustainability adoption feasible across the supply chain. This would also facilitate focal firm management to develop a sustainability culture across the supply chain. Originality/value: Similar work has not been carried before in which interaction among enablers and their priorities were analyzed using hybrid methodologies in developing country context. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is one of the most popular routing problems. In the CVRP, a fleet of capacitated vehicles located at a central depot are used to deliver products to a set of geographically dispersed customers with known demand. In this work, a new two-step approach to solve the CVRP with a heterogeneous fleet is proposed. In the first step; a balanced K-means clustering algorithm is used to aggregate the customers into balanced clusters. In the second step, clusters are assigned to vehicles and a MIP model is solved with adding valid inequalities that are used to reduce the volume of the mathematical model. Then the problem is disaggregated to find the detailed tours for each vehicle. The proposed approach was used to solve benchmark problems from literature, and it proved its efficiency in terms of quality, vehicle utilization, and computational time. The contribution of this work is combining the clustering algorithm with cutting techniques in order to find near-optimal solutions within reasonable computational times. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={One of the supply chain management active research areas is the Ecommerce-based material demand clustering. Demand clustering technique aggregates and combines the requirements with the application of a ecommerce-agent based to give a clear data of supplier requirements from the manufacturers. The analysis of material demand clustering is to offer all the manufacturers vehicle routing cost in a cost effective manner. Once the Ecommerce based agent identifies the raw material suppliers the next step is to devise a shortest route thru which the material is dispatched to all the manufacturers. In this paper we design a genetic approach to solve the shortest route and compare the solution with nearest neighbor solution and simulated annealing technique. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify a classification scheme which represents the variation in business and supply chain performance of supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry. Classification is done by presenting an empirical taxonomy of clusters representing supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry based on variation in supply chain excellence index (SCEI) and business performance index (BPI). Design/methodology/approach: The clustering of supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry is done by considering BPI and SCEI as clustering variables, which were found by using survey responses and results of a prior empirical study which was carried out in Indian manufacturing industry. The cluster analysis is performed by using Ward’s agglomerative hierarchical clustering followed by using K-means clustering algorithm to establish final set of clusters. Findings: It was found that supply chains in Indian manufacturing industries can be clustered in four major clusters which are named as strategic, celebrity, capable and undeveloped cluster. The characteristics of these clusters reveal some major characteristics of supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry. Originality/value: The research work presented in this paper takes a novel way to introduce the clusters of supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry. The researchers who are seeking patterns in large data sets of manufacturing companies of Indian industry will be benefitted by using the proposed clusters. While practitioners who are seeking to move their supply chain one step ahead will also reap the benefits of the paper by seeking the characteristics of particular cluster. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Increasing complexity in manufacturing companies has been one of the biggest issues during the last years. Companies in high-technology marketplaces are confronted with technology innovation, dynamic environmental conditions, changing customer requirements, globalization of markets and competitions as well as market uncertainty. Manufacturing companies can’t escape these trends, which induce an increasing amount of complexity. Reasons for this phenomenon are internal and external sources of complexity so-called complexity drivers. Identifying, analyzing and understanding complexity drivers are the first step for complexity management’s development and implementation. Complexity management is a strategic issue for companies to be competitive. The purpose of this literature review is to provide a general overview regarding complexity drivers in manufacturing companies. The different definitions of complexity drivers are described, and a new overall definition of complexity drivers is presented. Furthermore, the existing approaches for complexity driver’s identification, operationalization and visualization are identified and specified. For complexity driver’s clustering, a superior classification system was developed based upon existing classification systems in the literature. The literature review was done by systematically analyzing and collecting existing literature and reveals gaps according to methodology and issue. Existing literature reviews are only focused on specific issues, such as logistics or supply chain management, and do not point out the applied research methodology in detail. A general overview regarding complexity drivers in manufacturing companies and along the value chain does not exist yet. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={Considering the vital importance on pursuing sustaining competitive advantage and long-term success for enterprises, sustainable operation has aroused extensive interests in academia and industry. Understanding the trend can fill the research gap between theory and practice. It is vital not only to implement relevant research to help firms obtain sustainability, but also to find what has been studied till now and what need further exploration in the near future. This paper applied automatic content analysis approach from scientometrics to identify the trend of researches on sustainable operation. The database came from Web of Science during 1988–2015. Specifically, a multi-stage clustering technique based on bibliographic coupling has also been introduced to examine which topics, which research trend, and which new ideas contribute to the scientific journal fields of sustainable operation. Our results identified that energy related journals were the classic magazines in sustainable operation field and energy technology was the top topic. USA, UK and Germany had contributed the most journal articles in this field. With the rapid expansion of Asia, Asian scientists, like South Korea and Singapore, also published many sustainable operation papers. It had been a novel trend that the sustainable operation research field was incorporating a broader range of cultural backgrounds and combined with supply chain management. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the role and main attributes of manufacturing companies which operate in virtual supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - In order to identify the role and main attributes of manufacturing companies enabling to operate in a virtual supply chain, a three-step statistical analysis was employed, namely exploratory factor analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and non-hierarchical clustering technique. Findings - The findings show that virtual supply chain operations would not be supported by manufacturing companies offering highly customized products achieved by a unit production, developed in details and engineered to order. On the contrary, the large manufacturing companies of virtual supply chains report a high level of flexibility stemming from a wide scope of more standardized products offered to the market. The conducted study show that better ability of manufacturers supporting virtual supply chains is not industry specific. Research limitations/implications - The list of investigated attributes is not complete, and other characteristics of manufacturers in virtual supply chains should be identified. Another important shortcoming of the study is its quantitative character and generalization of the findings. Each "virtual" environment in supply chains may be unique and some of the compared characteristics may differ significantly. Therefore, the aforementioned attributes should be considered separately with a conscious focus on the environmental context. The quantitative study may be greatly enhanced by applying the case study approach, showing detailed solutions and practices, and thus making the study more valuable from the theoretical and managerial standpoints. Practical implications - The conducted study showed that better ability of manufacturers to support virtual supply chains is not industry specific, since the branch of electronic products and electrical equipment and components was represented by an equal share of manufacturers, both in non-virtual and virtual clusters. Furthermore, in order to operate in virtual supply chains, managers should pay attention to the structure and range of products delivered to the market. The managers should also be aware that apart from considering cost and efficiency, operating in a virtual supply chain environment also requires quality of products and processes in order to manufacture and deliver a superior value for the customers. Originality/value - Having recognized major groups of indicators demonstrating the level of ability of manufacturing companies to operate in a virtual supply chain, the attributes of three clusters of manufacturers possessing different bunch of features, significant for virtual supply chains, have been distinguished. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Over the past decades, efficient supply chain management is recognized as a key strategic technology and resource in firms' success. Recent studies have been increasingly conducted network analysis in the fields of supply chain management and supplier-customer relationships. It is crucial to analyze interactional relationships and topological characteristics between suppliers and customers in supply networks rather than in traditionally linear supply chains. For this purpose, we involve a real-world supply network at central region in Japan in this paper and investigate different network structures of suppliercustomer relationships using network analysis techniques from three different scales. Firstly from the macro-scale, the network analysis approach provides clarity concerning network feature such as average path length. This feature can estimate the efficiency of material flow in the supply network, which also reveals the cost how passed to the final customers. Secondly from the meso-scale, we apply a network clustering algorithm to detect communities from the whole supply network, which is separated into five main supplier-customer communities. We also mark for individual communities via cross-location and crossindustry, which reveals the different features to bridge different business communities. Finally from the micro-scale, we extract core firms of each community using node degree-prior based on location-specific and industry-specific. We estimate the robustness of supply network by sequential elimination choice strategy of these hubs, which can also deliver efficient and effective support to supply network design and management. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of a sustainable supply chain is the strategic integration of all social, environmental and economic goals within an organization, through a systematic coordination of key business processes in order to improve the long-term economic performance of a company and its value chain. This paper describes a new methodological approach to support the strategy formulation process in sustainable supply chains. The proposed methodology combines three analytical tools (analytic hierarchical process, fuzzy multi-objective optimization, and clustering methods) within a strategy formulation process, integrating the competitive and corporative strategies with the supply chain strategy on the basis of sustainability. A case study in the Mexican Federal Commission of Electricity Gulf-Center Distribution Division shows the capability of our proposed framework. This company is large and complex enough to encompass the whole issue of the supply chain. Results indicate that our methodology is a valid decision support tool to formulate a set of sustainable supply chain strategies, and it is able to generate a coordinated strategy for the management of a sustainable supply chain. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate and analyse the perceptions of South Australian construction practitioners on drivers affecting the implementation of reverse logistics (RL). In this context, RL is defined as the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value or ensuring proper disposal. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight practitioners to collect data and the interview transcripts were analysed using the NVivo (version 10) package. Cluster analysis was used to cross-validate the findings and provide an in-depth insight into the findings. Findings - The findings indicate that most of the drivers identified in earlier research are relevant for the construction industry. In addition, the study identified some new drivers that are categorised as "targeted demands by an exclusive clientele". These drivers were found to be complementary to the economic, environmental and social drivers as previously conceptualised. In addition, a set of factors affecting the strength of drivers that had been overlooked in previous studies emanated from the interview analysis. These include the type of project and the attributes of clients, both of which strongly affect the drivers of RL implementation in construction. Research limitations/implications - The major limitations are the relatively small size of the sample of interviewees and having interviewees from one geographic area with specific socio-economic characteristics. Practical implications - The identified drivers and the clustering of RL themes could be used by practitioners as a "road map" for the development of appropriate solutions to successfully promote RL within the construction industry. Organisational energies could thus be channelled towards the drivers that need the most improvement. Originality/value - The study contributes to this research sphere by employing cluster analysis to customise and contextualise the drivers that were previously identified. The study goes beyond the extant literature by discovering the prominent effects of these drivers on the impact of targeted demands by an exclusive clientele. This could be of great value in terms of creating avenues for future investigations on the topic. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the two most prominent wireless technologies for implementing a complete smart environment for Internet of Things (IoT). Both technologies complement each other hence integration of both is used in a wide variety of applications like: Traffic management, health, care monitoring systems, war-field, animal tracking, supply chain management etc. Security issue are of the most important concern and constraint of these kind of networks as both RFID and sensor networks have scarcity of resources which requires light computation based cryptography. In this work one cryptographic primitive of security, availability, is ensured through outlier detection mechanism. A threshold based anomaly detection mechanism is proposed which allows inliers only for secure communication, thus ensures availability. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things is one of the emerging technologies that support different domains to manage and optimize performance, allowing for new activities such as data analytics, management and security. First, this paper illustrate various application scenarios, the IoT supporting domains including resource management, Education, Agriculture, Health care, water quality, natural disasters, transportation, security, automobile, supply chain management, smart cities, Automated metering and monitoring of utilities, waste management, Oil & Gas, security and privacy, energy management. Future, IoT enabling ubiquitous connectivity will cause a faster enhance of data traffic load in both wired and wireless communication networks. The data will be both homogeneous and heterogeneous and the issue arises due to interoperability, Scalability and the middleware Architecture of the IoT systems. We have also discussed about the Issues and Challenges that were faced in the Internet of Things system. We have given an proposed Data Management and Security (DMS) Architecture for IoT system to face challenges like creating ontology's and defining data models are not enough, so data selection refining noisy data from the database through data clustering and selection method through the existing algorithms has to be done. Also, the Security of the Internet of Things systems has been discussed, to overcome some of the Issues and Challenges in Privacy and Security. © International Science Press.},

abstract={The Industry 4.0, when it comes into effect, will essentially transform supply chain management, action plans and business procedures [1]. However, a major challenge to the process of product design and development rests upon how flexible a production in a batch can be, and how to maintain the economic conditions of mass production in the same time [2]. This study aims to develop an automatic system that shows the potential of designing a product form by co-designing with the user. Artificial Intelligent techniques will be applied with Kansei engineering system in order to use as an ingenious product co-design system. First, supervised back propagation neural network (BPNN) will be co-operated with the genetic algorithm technique to optimize each design element value from Kansei engineering system. Then, the style and preference of each user will be used as a categorizing factor clustering the database into groups with K-mean technique. Each classifying cluster will use its own database in the system processing in order to obtain a set of precise design elements precisely based on the system. Moreover, the system acquires user’s feedback as well as the preference cluster to revise its KE system formula. This project will apply the cross-validation as an unbiased model performance evaluation. The genuine use of this system will bring the benefit to the manufacturers by saving the lead time when their product is put on the market, and consequently ensure customers’ satisfaction with the product form. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is finding the current state of research and identifies high-potential area for future investigation in optimization in supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper we present Bibliometric and Network analysis to examine current state research on optimization in supply chain management to identify established and emergent research field for future investigation. The systematic research review which we used in our study have not grasp or assess by other researchers on this topic. Firstly, based on our methodology Bibliometric analysis began by identifying 1610 publications raised from scientific journals, included literatures from 1994 to March of 2016. Secondly, we applied PageRank algorithm in our data for citation analysis to indicate the significance of a publication. Thirdly, the topological decision variables analysis is done based on Louvain method for network data clustering, for this proposes we used the rigorous tools. Finding: Based on our Network analysis result, the optimization in supply chain management research can be divided into four clusters/modules that introduced fundamental skill, knowledge, theory, application and method. Research limitations/implications: We presented some limitation in our research in some fields which could allow new researchers and practitioners conduct the future research to grow up in different dimensions. Practical implications: Practitioners or policy maker usually are not familiar with these type researches so this is why mush of these survey remain in theatrical and conceptual. Future investigation needs to play in practical application domain instead stop merely in opinion. Originality/value: Based on our research, the researchers have more attention to work in conceptual analysis due to other fields but we believe that in facility location problem there many remarkable rooms still exist for future research to development. We also contributed more details in the papers. © 2016, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Recognizing construction assets from as-is point cloud data of construction environment provides essential information for engineering and management applications including progress monitoring, safety management, supply-chain management, and quality control. This study proposes a fast and automated processing pipeline for construction target assets recognition from scattered as-is point clouds. The recognition tasks can be subdivided into object detection, which involves computing the bounding box around each construction equipment, and object classification, which involves labelling point cloud clusters from discrete equipment categories, such as backhoe loader, bulldozer, dump truck, excavator and front loader. The object detection step consists of point cloud down-sampling, segmentation and clustering. For the object classification step, machine learning methods were employed to determine class membership probability using features derived from the ESF (Ensemble of Shape Functions) descriptor. The classifiers were trained on synthetic point clouds generated from CAD (Computer-aided Design) models. The method was validated using laser scanned point clouds from an equipment yard. The test results demonstrate promising advancements towards semantic labelling and scene understanding of point cloud data.},

abstract={Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the management of the products and goods flow from its origin point to point of consumption. During the process of SCM, information and dataset gathered for this application is massive and complex. This is due to its several processes such as procurement, product development and commercialization, physical distribution, outsourcing and partnerships. For a practical application, SCM datasets need to be managed and maintained to serve a better service to its three main categories; distributor, customer and supplier. To manage these datasets, a structure of data constellation is used to accommodate the data into the spatial database. However, the situation in geospatial database creates few problems, for example the performance of the database deteriorate especially during the query operation. We strongly believe that a more practical hierarchical tree structure is required for efficient process of SCM. Besides that, three-dimensional approach is required for the management of SCM datasets since it involve with the multi-level location such as shop lots and residential apartments. 3D R-Tree has been increasingly used for 3D geospatial database management due to its simplicity and extendibility. However, it suffers from serious overlaps between nodes. In this paper, we proposed a partition-based clustering for the construction of a hierarchical tree structure. Several datasets are tested using the proposed method and the percentage of the overlapping nodes and volume coverage are computed and compared with the original 3D R-Tree and other practical approaches. The experiments demonstrated in this paper substantiated that the hierarchical structure of the proposed partitionbased clustering is capable of preserving minimal overlap and coverage. The query performance was tested using 300,000 points of a SCM dataset and the results are presented in this paper. This paper also discusses the outlook of the structure for future reference.},

abstract={Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) has wide applications in logistics and supply chain management and thus is one of the widely studied problems in the field of Operational Research. It is also a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem and many different kinds of algorithms and techniques have been proposed to solve VRP. There are many types of VRP and this paper concentrates on two variants: Multiple-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP) and Stochastic Vehicle Routing problem (SVRP). While both MDVRP and SVRP enjoy wide popularity in literature, a combination of these two is not yet explored. The objective of this paper is to solve for MDVRP with stochastic travel times using a metaheuristic procedure in Evolutionary Computation called Genetic Algorithms (GA). A new hybrid population seeding technique is proposed for generating feasible solutions in the initial population. A randomized initial population generation technique is used to compare with the proposed hybrid population seeding technique and the results are compared. The results clearly conclude that the hybrid population seeding technique clearly yields better solutions in terms of time needed and distance travelled to serve the customers. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose – The Canadian apparel industry has long been challenged by imports from low-wage countries while its exports have declined since their height in 2002. This situation was exacerbated with trade liberalisation, which started in January 2005. Data from Industry Canada and a number of studies, amongst which those of the Apparel Human Resources Council (AHRC), showing the adverse effects of trade liberalisation since the phasing out of the multi-fibre agreement in 2005, the lack of competitive advantage for Canada as an apparel manufacturing nation and the subsequent rapid decline of its apparel industry, pointed to the need for a strategic response from the Canadian apparel industry, particularly from small to medium-sized enterprises. A study conducted for the AHRC of the Federal Government of Canada outlined a number of strategies that Canadian apparel companies could pursue, focusing on elements other than manufacturing in the traditional apparel value chain. These strategies seemed to suggest the implementation of a cluster approach where greater cooperation between suppliers would be required throughout the supply chain with a focus on functional expertise and relationships. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether a cluster strategy is being applied or if indeed it is applicable to Canada’s apparel companies. Design/methodology/approach – A literature search, was undertaken to find the options available for the organisation of SMEs so that: an analytical framework could be created from the various theories and concepts that; would enable the evidence-based selection of an option or options suitable for adoption by Canadian apparel SMEs, to assist them to be more effective than stand-alone enterprises. Data were collected from case studies of Canadian apparel companies, an Experience Survey (conducted through face-to-face interviews with the directors of the AHRC, the Canadian Apparel Federation, Industry Canada, and Canadian retail and apparel supply executives) and from the responses to an online questionnaire sent to Canadian apparel suppliers. The data were subjected to examination using the analytical framework to determine whether the evidence existed on which to base a cluster-based strategic response to competition from overseas apparel suppliers, or whether one of the alternative options might be a more suitable match with the Canadian apparel business environment. Findings – Neither the case studies nor the Experience Survey revealed sufficient evidence of open communication or of cooperation among suppliers in areas that would fortify horizontal clustering amongst apparel SMEs, such as the sharing of labour, market research or supply chain management; similar findings emerged from the online questionnaire sent to Canadian apparel suppliers, which showed little evidence favouring cluster development as a strategic response for the Canadian apparel supply industry. The research also showed that industrialists, experts and government advisors all recognised that, beginning with trade liberalisation in 2005, there had been a transformation of the Canadian apparel industry from a manufacturing to a service industry with the retailers taking much stronger control of the supply chain than before, which, taken together with the lack of open communication or cooperation among apparel suppliers gives rise to conditions which favour collaboration over clustering. Originality/value – The paper provides a firm evidence base upon which to develop a different strategy for Canadian SMEs than the cluster approach that has been proposed to date. The findings reported in this paper show that Canadian apparel industry leaders, government and industry-led support organisations, retailers and suppliers all recognise that the type of open communication or of cooperation among suppliers in areas that would fortify horizontal clustering amongst apparel SMEs, such as the sharing of labour, market research or supply chain management does not occur to a sufficient extent to support the adoption of a cluster strategy by the Canadian apparel sector (although it may be applicable in Quebec). Canadian retailers have now taken the leading role in the supplier/ retailer relationship. Any future strategy will need to take account of this repositioning of retailers and be centred upon vertical relationships between individual apparel suppliers and retailers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={One of the most important problem in supply chain management is the design of distribution systems which can reduce the transportation costs and meet the customer's demand at the minimum time. In recent years, cross-docking (CD) centers have been considered as the place that reduces the transportation and inventory costs. Meanwhile, neglecting the optimum location of the centers and the optimum routing and scheduling of the vehicles mislead the optimization process to local optima. Accordingly, in this research, the integrated vehicle routing and scheduling problem in cross-docking systems is modeled. In this new model, the direct shipment from the manufacturers to the customers is also included. Besides, the vehicles are assigned to the cross-dock doors with lower cost. Next, to solve the model, a novel machine-learning-based heuristic method (MLBM) is developed, in which the customers, manufacturers and locations of the cross-docking centers are grouped through a bi-clustering approach. In fact, the MLBM is a filter based learning method that has three stages including customer clustering through a modified bi-clustering method, sub-problems' modeling and solving the whole model. In addition, for solving the scheduling problem of vehicles in cross-docking system, this paper proposes exact solution as well as genetic algorithm (GA). GA is also adapted for large-scale problems in which exact methods are not efficient. Furthermore, the parameters of the proposed GA are tuned via the Taguchi method. Finally, for validating the proposed model, several benchmark problems from literature are selected and modified according to new introduced assumptions in the base models. Different statistical analysis methods are implemented to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nowadays, the integration of sustainability into supply chain management (SCM) is a key issue for ensuring corporate competitiveness in face of dynamic ecological and social environments. This paper reviews 185 journal publications of the last 20 years that formalize issues related to sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in quantitative models. In a content analysis, modeling and SCM characteristics as well as sustainability and SSCM constructs are elaborated. The models are assessed numerically by counting frequencies of occurrence and by clustering the paper sample according to selected characteristics. The findings indicate that SSCM models predominantly focus on deterministic approaches and the integration of environmental aspects of sustainability while neglecting stochastic modeling techniques and the consideration of social factors. By now, comprehensive modeling approaches are most often employed on intra-organizational levels whereas broader application areas are assessed by less complex models. The integration of pressures and incentives of external stakeholders or the formalization of sustainable supplier management and sustainability risks are identified as future research perspectives. Furthermore, the interrelationships between the triple bottom line dimensions are to be scrutinized in greater detail in order to avoid focused optimization of selected sustainability criteria. Seven modeling guidelines are derived from the reviewed literature to facilitate future model-based SSCM research. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.},

abstract={This paper presents an efficiency and adaptive cryptographic protocol to ensure users' privacy and data integrity in RFID system. Radio Frequency Identification technology offers more intelligent systems and applications, but privacy and security issues have to be addressed before and after its adoption. The design of the proposed model is based on clustering configuration of the involved tags where they interchange the data with the reader whenever it sends a request. This scheme provides a strong mutual authentication framework that suits for real heterogeneous RFID applications such as in supply-chain management systems, healthcare monitoring and industrial environment. In addition, we contribute with a mathematical analysis to the delay analysis and optimization in a clustering topology tag-based. Finally, a formal security and proof analysis is demonstrated to prove the effectiveness of the proposed protocol and that achieves security and privacy. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Detection of emerging fields in any industry is of great importance to the industrialists, engineers and policy makers of business as well as state administration. Exact awareness of the paradigm which governs current research activities and chances of likely paradigm shifts which could redefine the research approaches, is very crucial for the actors of scientific community and policy makers. Excellent technologies in IT, even accelerated the scientific and applied ontological pursuit in both academia as well as industry. In this work, network approach is advocated for the identification of innovations, new paradigms and emerging fields in the IT industry in the research area 'engineering'. The network is a scientific network of research publications which reflects the volume and flow of scientific activities. Centrality analysis, path analysis, cluster analysis, etc. are used to identify the key papers of paradigm shifts, emerging fields, relatively important clusters and works respectively. A new metric, flow vergence index is devised for cluster analysis. The paradigm shift identified from this network is RFID technology, related with the supply chain management. With proper economic and policy supports, there are some good reasons to look forward for more wonders from the industry. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The singularities of the food industry supply chain and possibilities to apply the temperature control technologies, considering the different aspects of supply chain management, are analysed in this paper. The statistical analysis of the food industry supply chain is presented. The paper describes how the system for distribution of chilled and frozen food, from manufacturer to end-user, operates in small market countries, focusing on temperature control influence on the energy consumption. Taking into account the analysed information, it was concluded that clustering processes can dramatically reduce the cost of food supply chain.},

abstract={Predictive power is an important objective for current business performance measurement systems and it is based on metrics design, collection and preprocessing of data and predictive modeling. A promising but less studied preprocessing activity is to construct additional features that can be interpreted to express the quality of data and thus provide predictive models not only data points but also their quality characteristics. The research problem addressed in this study is: can we improve the predictive power of business performance measurement systems by constructing additional data quality features? Unsupervised, supervised and domain knowledge approaches were used to operationalize eight features based on elementary data quality dimensions. In the case studies five corporate datasets Toyota Material Handling Finland, Innolink group, 3stepIt, Papua Merchandising and Lempesti constructed data quality features performed better than minimally processed data sets in 29/38 and equally in 9/38 tests. Comparison to a competing method of preprocessing combinations with the first two datasets showed that constructed features had slightly lower prediction performance, but they were clearly better in execution time and easiness of use. Additionally, constructed data quality features helped to visually explore high dimensional data quality patterns. Further research is needed to expand the range of constructed features and to map the findings systematically to data quality concepts and practices. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Human decisions play an essential role in Operations and Supply Chain Management. However, these decisions are rarely integrated in simulation models of Production and Logistic Systems. One main reason for this fact is the strong dispersion of human decisions among a population, as well as the variability of a single individual’s decision over time. This work presents an experimental study of a human decision consisting in the dynamic selection of suppliers in a well-controlled laboratory environment. The analysis of the results obtained on a large population shows that individual decision behaviors can be grouped into representative clusters typifying different decision behaviors. The results obtained from this study opens up the prospect to significantly reduce the number of decision models required to simulate Production and Logistic Systems including human decisions and could also allow categorizing human decision behavior based on a set of known criteria. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.},

The MCDM methods correspond to Electre and FlowSort and both are applied to the classification of providers in an actual case of the local softdrink bottling industry in Chile. The results show that Electre as an outranking method it may well classify suppliers in a similar manner as FlowSort does. Nevertheless, due to the intrinsic underlying fuzzy multicriteria nature of the problem, FlowSort is found to be more suitable method for building a rule-based system based on preference functions for automating the process of suppliers clustering when developing strategies of relationship management in the sense of the Kraljic categories in supply chain management. © 2006-2015 by CCC Publications.},

abstract={Radio frequencies refer to the electromagnetic energy that we transmit the identification information from tags to its reader. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) transmits the data without line of sight. RFID tags are small, wireless devices that help identify item automatically and indicating unique serial number for each item. However, counterfeiting in supply chain management likes cloned and fraud RFID tag bring the impact to the organization and social when attackers want to gain illegal benefits.Organizationsarelosing a lot of money and trust from userswhen counterfeiting occurred. Furthermore, RFID data nature characteristics faces the issues likes RFID just carry simple information, in-flood of data, inaccuracy data from RFID readers and difficulties to track spatial and place. We propose to use clustering algorithms in order to detect counterfeit in supply chain management. We will apply various clustering algorithms to analyzed and determine every attribute in the dataset structure pattern. Based on evaluation that have done, we found that Farthest First is the best algorithm for 1000 (small data) and 10000 (bigger data). However, the values of false negative in data still quite high and it is dangerous if RFID scanner misread the cloned or fraud tags become genuine tags. Hence, we applied cost algorithms to reduce false negative values.},

abstract={Object tracking in the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a hot topic over the past ten years. Currently, the integration of video and radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology plays a crucial role in item-level activity recognition. Various techniques and applications have been proposed for visual object tracking. However, identifying semantic features of item-level objects in huge size of video content is a non-trivial task, especially in supply chain management. To alleviate this problem, this paper presents a novel method that applies IoT information to facilitate video summarization. Differing from common video summarization techniques, we use IoT information to select key frames of the video content during the background model establishment. Then we match other key frames with the background to extract important features. Finally, a compact summarization image for queried objects is generated according to a clustering analysis. We have also performed experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed work. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, almost all kind of electronic devices leave traces of their movements (e.g. smartphone, GPS devices and so on). Thus, the huge number of this "tiny" data sources leads to the generation of massive data streams of geo-referenced data. As a matter of fact, the effective analysis of such amounts of data is challenging, since the possibility to extract useful information from this peculiar kind of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, hand-off in cellular networks, supply chain management. Moreover, spatial data streams management poses new challenges both for their proper definition and acquisition, thus making the overall process harder than for classical point data. In particular, we are interested in solving the problem of effective trajectory data streams clustering, that revealed really intriguing as we deal with sequential data that have to be properly managed due to their ordering. We propose a framework that allow data pre-elaboration in order to make the mining step more effective. As for every data mining tool, the experimental evaluation is crucial, thus we performed several tests on real world datasets that confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={In this study, we propose a two-echelon multi-objective dual-sale channel supply chain network (DCSCN) model. The goal is to determine (i) the set of installed DCs, (ii) the set of customers the DC should work with, how much inventory each DC should order and (iv) the distribution routes for physical retailers or online e-tailers (all starting and ending at the same DC). Our model overcomes the drawback by simultaneously tackling location and routing decisions. In addition to the typical costs associated with facility location and the inventory-related costs, we explicitly consider the pivotal routing costs between the DCs and their assigned customers. Therefore, a multiple objectives location-routing model involves two conflicting objectives is initially proposed so as to permit a comprehensive trade-off evaluation. To solve this multiple objectives programming problem, this study integrates genetic algorithms, clustering analysis, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). NSGA-II searches for the Pareto set. Several experiments are simulated to demonstrate the possibility and efficacy of the proposed approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={In the evolution of the urban logistics network, cost is critical and distance is very important. Taking them as driving mechanisms, this paper proposes an evolution model attempting to mimic a real urban logistics network's growth. Numerical simulations reveal that the distributions of degree and strength show good power law behavior; yet, the distribution of weight does not follow typical power-law behavior, revealing the uneven distribution of volume in the network. The nonlinear correlation between the strength and degree indicates a "rich get richer" phenomenon. Besides, the clustering coefficients, both topological and weighted, illustrate that nodes with small degree most incline to aggregate, yet those with high degree behind. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={The division of highways is especially important for road management, information storage, maintenance, evaluation of safety and accident prediction. The existing research mostly divides the highway on the basis of road management, information storage, and maintenance instead of safety. This paper firstly summarizes the common methods of road division, analyzing their advantages and disadvantages. The four accident indicators can reflect the road safety comprehensively. The paper then analyses the highway division using Fisher orderly clustering in consideration of three factors, namely: (1) the number of accidents; (2) the number of deaths in road accidents per kilometer; and (3) the number of those injured in road accidents.

abstract={For emergency aid after the occurrence of an uncertain demand, the paper construct an Emergency Scheduling Model combined with multi-objective-to-resource. First, the paper uses simulation for a trapezoidal fuzzy number to research the uncertainty of emergency supplies demand. It then builds the demand constraint satisfaction function with multi-resources. Secondly, by scatter time to phase sequence, under the emergency supplies uncertain demand, a multi-objective optimization model of emergency supplies distribution of more reserves points and varieties supplies is set up. Third, in order to determine the order of distribution of materials to affected areas, hybrid fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed. Finally, to analyze the examples of emergency supplies reserve participating in the actual emergency relief distribution in the Wen Chuan earthquake, examine the multi-objective combinatorial optimization model. As a result, the proposed method in the emergency rescue has strong applicability and good performance, and verifies the rationality of the model and the feasibility of the algorithm. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={As the result of traffic state clustering, only the characteristics of the data itself are represented; it lacks traffic theory basis. The consistency verification is proposed in this paper. Firstly, using the traffic state dividing theory from the perspective of combining theory and practice, the traffic state dividing machine is constructed based on Fuzzy C-means Clustering. Secondly, the completeness of detecting data on the road section is classified into three types: (1) contains congestion, but lacks top data in the statistical period; (2) contains both congestion and top data; and (3) does not contain congestion. Thirdly, the consistency of the clustering result and traffic state dividing theory is verified by a non-parametric statistical test method. Finally, data is taken from 43 dual-loops on the eastern side of the Shanghai north-south expressway for 10 days as examples, and the empirical analysis is realized. The results show that the samples of the first and second types are all successfully verified. That is to say, the traffic state clustering results of these two types can be taken as the final result of traffic state identification, but the clustering results of the third type need be modified by regression analysis. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

For supplier selection in supply chain, hierarchical clustering according to the studied indexes first clusters suppliers. Then, according to its cluster, each supplier is evaluated through Grey Relational Analysis. Then the combination of suppliers' Pareto optimal rank and costs are obtained using Artificial Bee Colony meta-heuristic algorithm. A case study is conducted for a better description of a new algorithm to select a multiple source of suppliers. © 2014 Growing Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a widespread strategy and process of identifying, retaining and associating selective customers in order to sustain their relationship with the organization. By the application of CRM, greater efficacy and effectiveness in delivering strategies could be achieved. To support CRM in retail sector, many data mining techniques are applied in identifying, attracting, developing and retaining the customer's relationships. On the other hand, the retailers are unable to predict the demand of products which may leads to inconsistencies in profit by the use of CRM. To overcome this disadvantage, an integrated version of CRM along with Supply Chain Management (SCM) is designed which affords the stock requirement from SCM based on the demand in CRM. Thus SCM with CRM enhances the retailers profit, meet the customer's demand and retain the current customers. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={With globalization, chain management is becoming increasingly challenging in today's competitive world. A great amount of uncertainties with the supply chain and demand and the globalization of the market in a complex international supply chain network relationship have led to higher exposure to risks in the supply chain. In this paper, we have developed a model of a knowledge-based supply chain risk management system which includes four modules: basic database management, supply chain risk early warnings and risk management strategies module. We analyze the basis process of knowledge-based supply chain risk management which includes four steps: knowledge collection, knowledge discovery, knowledge sharing and knowledge study. Finally, we defined three simple association rules application to the supply chain risk management. © 2014 ISSN 1881-803X.},

abstract={Complex networks theory grows rapidly since 1998 and has attracted various researchers in the world. The research on supply chain's evolution has great theoretical and practical importance in a global logistics supply chain and to a simple enterprise in the supply chain. In this study, based on the knowledge of complex networks and Multi-agent simulation, supply chain networks of enterprises, as well as statistical analysis, were established and researched. On different optimal conditions for the establishment of cooperative networks of different companies, the statistical nature of the obtained co-operation between enterprises was analyzed. When the degree preference was considered, an interesting supply chain network was got with bimodal distribution in degree, uniform distribution in clustering coefficient and hierarchy topological structure. The present model extends previous approaches to the development of supply chain management. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={An RFID technology is most important process in supply chain management. In order to know the movements of products in supply chain management, an RFID tag is attached to a product. If the product with an RFID tag moves or stays near the detection region, RFID readers will detect RFID tags information. If the data volume gets increased, the processing of such RFID data becomes complex and hence storing and retrieving data to be very challenging. Nowadays, the RFID data related research works, the complexity reduction on processing such RFID data remains a big challenge. Hence to avoid such negative aspects a new RFID data encoding scheme is proposed in the supply chain management. To reduce the complexity of the processing the RFID data's, or proposed method utilizing orthogonal transformation and optimization model during the raw data processing. Initially, the RFID data to be processed by the orthogonal transformation and that the data's are optimally clustered by the well renowned optimization technique is named as GA. After that, the clustered data's are encoded by exploiting the path encoding and order encoding schemes. Based on the path encoding scheme and the order encoding scheme, we devise a storage scheme that can process tracking queries and path oriented queries efficiently on an RDBMS. Finally, we propose a method that translates the queries to SQL queries. The proposed method is implemented and the queries are efficiently retrieved and the results are compared against the conventional RFID path encoding scheme. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose: Motivated by a lack of studies in graduate level supply chain education, this research aims to explore trends in supply chain-related graduate programmes in Europe and to propose a framework for designing such programmes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors determine "knowledge" and "skills" areas applicable to supply chain management (SCM) education and analyse supply chain-related graduate programmes published by the European Logistics Association in 2004. They revisit the same programmes in 2011 to determine the recent situation and the trends. The authors use cluster analysis to reveal the similarities and differences among these programmes. Findings: The authors find two distinct clusters: focused and diversified. Focused programmes offer modules in knowledge and skills areas apart from SCM at a negligible level and place more emphasis on SCM in 2011 when compared to 2004. Diversified programmes show a similar increase in the emphasis on SCM with more variety in the knowledge and skills areas. Research limitations/implications: The authors' findings are based on SCM programmes delivered in Europe and over two discrete time periods. Future research should seek to extend this analysis to other continents with larger samples and incorporate the industry perspective to determine the potential gap between what programmes offer and what industry requires. Practical implications: SCM-related graduate programmes continue to redefine themselves. Clustering predominantly serves the universities in re-assessing and re-engineering their programmes, helps prospective graduates in their selection process and assists managers in their recruitment practices. Originality/value: This paper establishes a baseline for assessing SCM-related graduate programmes with respect to the knowledge and skills they offer and introduces a framework that may serve as a starting point for the design and positioning of such programmes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Collaboration between partners is a very popular subject in both logistics and decision support research. However, transport management is often taken into account only as an external cost, without integration in collaborative reasoning. This paper proposes a framework to assess collaborative solutions in the context of logistics and freight transport, as well as to describe the links between freight transport and supply chain management in terms of collaboration techniques. First die main concepts of collaborative logistics in the distribution and transport fields are presented, highlighting die links between collaboration, freight transport and supply chain management. Then, the method to assess collaborative logistics and freight transport solutions is proposed. This mediod includes a design scheme, a hierarchic clustering technique and a dominance analysis method to unify the assessment of each individual and prepare collaborative research for a common solution. After that, the method is applied to the assessment of five scenarios derived from a real situation for the urban area of Lyon (France) to illustrate how difficult convergence towards consensus is. The results show that a global optimal solution for the entire set of stakeholders is not easy to identify, and how the proposed method can be helpful for decision makers to achieve a consensus of common objectives.},

abstract={Purpose: Consumer values increasingly favor sustainable development in products and services, thereby fostering the need to develop new operational and managerial practices that support sustainability in supply chain management. The purpose of this study is to identify relevant product features related to sustainable development in this context, and use the choice of mobile phone as an example in measuring their importance. Design/methodology/approach: The study used two different methods (qualitative and quantitative) in two phases. First it organized focus-group discussions in order to identify the features of sustainability that affect the choice of a mobile phone. The most significant features served as a starting point for the choice of attributes to be included in the final step, choice-based conjoint analysis (CBC), which assesses respondents' value functions by means of latent class clustering. Between the two major phases it carried out two additional pre-tests in order to reduce the number of attributes. Findings: The results provide fundamental information concerning the relative importance of sustainability features in the selection of a mobile phone. The study identified four different clusters of purchasers: updaters, budgeters, environmentalists, and long-life users. According to the findings, some consumers are willing to pay a premium for sustainability features. The authors discuss the potential implications of the results in the context of supply chain design. Originality/value: The literature on supply chain management tends to see the consumers as a "black box". This paper reports the first results of opening this box by linking the supply chain perspective to consumer choice behavior. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Global manufacturers have faced unprecedented cost pressures in China because of Chinese currency appreciation, rising labour costs, higher oil prices and reduced value-added tax rebates. This paper aims to reassess the decision of operating global manufacturing facilities in China. A mixed integer programming model is developed for a typical global manufacturing supply chain that includes production in the Pearl River Delta region and trade in Hong Kong. A case study with a footwear product is used to illustrate model application and present detailed analyses. The modelling results affirm the need of relocating labour-intensive production that mainly competes on low costs. Nevertheless, coastal China offers considerable benefits from industrial clustering and a logistics advantage in comparison with inland China and Asian countries where labour costs are still relatively low. Hong Kong remains a robust location choice for trade operations because of its favourable tax policies. Retaining production in China faces high risks from Chinese currency appreciation, while relocation to lower-cost Asian countries is more vulnerable to risks from high oil prices. An intermediate trade operation in Hong Kong can be used to hedge against risks from unfavourable tax policy changes at manufacturing locations. China has risen to an important position in global manufacturing because of its cost advantages. This paper analyzes the new phenomenon of dramatically increasing cost pressures in China. It develops a first-of-its-kind supply chain configuration model for the popular front-shop-back-factory business model in China. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Trajectory data streams are huge amounts of data pertaining to time and position of moving objects. They are continuously generated by different sources exploiting a wide variety of technologies (e.g., RFID tags, GPS, GSM networks). Mining such amount of data is a challenging problem, since the possibility to extract useful information from this peculiar kind of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, hand-off in cellular networks, supply chain management. Moreover, spatial data streams pose interesting challenges for their proper representation, thus making the mining process harder than for classical point data. In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory data streams clustering, that revealed really intriguing as we deal with a kind of data (trajectories) for which the order of elements is relevant. We propose a complete framework starting from data preparation task that allows us to make the mining step quite effective. Since the validation of data mining approaches has to be experimental we performed several tests on real world datasets that confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to advance supply chain network theory by applying theoretical and empirical developments in complex network literature to the context of supply chains as complex adaptive systems. The authors synthesize these advancements to gain an understanding of the network properties underlying efficient supply chains. To develop a suitable theory of supply chain networks, the authors look to mirror the properties of complex network models with real-world supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The authors review complex network literature drawn from multiple disciplines in top scientific journals. From this interdisciplinary review a series of propositions are developed around supply chain complexity and adaptive phenomena. Findings: This paper proposes that the structure of efficient supply chains follows a "scale-free" network. This proposal emerges from arguments that the key properties of efficient supply chains are a short characteristic path length, a high clustering coefficient and a power law connectivity distribution. Research limitations/implications: The authors' discussion centres on applying advances found in recent complex network literature. Hence, the need is noted to empirically validate the series of propositions developed in this paper in a supply chain context. Practical implications: If efficient supply chains resemble a scale-free network, then managers can derive a number of implications. For example, supply chain resilience is derived by the presence of hub firms. To reduce the vulnerability of supply chains to cascading failures, it is recognized that managers could build in redundancy, undertake a multi-sourcing strategy or intermediation between hub firms. Originality/value: This paper advances supply chain network theory. It offers a novel understanding of supply chains as complex adaptive systems and, in particular, that efficient and resilient supply chain systems resemble a scale-free network. In addition, it provides a series of propositions that allow modelling and empirical research to proceed. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The emerging biobased economy is causing shifts from mineral fossil oil based resources towards renewable resources. Because of market mechanisms, current and new industries utilising renewable commodities, will attempt to secure their supply of resources. Cellulose is among these commodities, where large scale competition can be expected and already is observed for the traditional industries such as the paper industry. Cellulose and lignocellulosic raw materials (like wood and non-wood fibre crops) are being utilised in many industrial sectors. Due to the initiated transition towards biobased economy, these raw materials are intensively investigated also for new applications such as 2nd generation biofuels and 'green' chemicals and materials production (Clark, 2007; Lange, 2007; Petrus & Noordermeer, 2006; Ragauskas et al.; 2006; Regalbuto, 2009). As lignocellulosic raw materials are available in variable quantities and qualities, unnecessary competition can be avoided via the choice of suitable raw materials for a target application. For example, utilisation of cellulose as carbohydrate source for ethanol production (Kabir Kazi et al.; 2010) avoids the discussed competition with easier digestible carbohydrates (sugars, starch) deprived from the food supply chain. Also for cellulose use as a biopolymer several different competing markets can be distinguished. It is clear that these applications and markets will be influenced by large volume shifts. The world will have to reckon with the increase of competition and feedstock shortage (land use/biodiversity) (van Dam, de Klerk-Engels, Struik, & Rabbinge, 2005). It is of interest-in the context of sustainable development of the bioeconomy-to categorize the already available and emerging lignocellulosic resources in a matrix structure. When composing such "cellulose resource matrix" attention should be given to the quality aspects as well as to the available quantities and practical possibilities of processing the feedstock and the performance in the end-application. The cellulose resource matrix should become a practical tool for stakeholders to make choices regarding raw materials, process or market. Although there is a vast amount of scientific and economic information available on cellulose and lignocellulosic resources, the accessibility for the interested layman or entrepreneur is very difficult and the relevance of the numerous details in the larger context is limited. Translation of science to practical accessible information with modern data management and data integration tools is a challenge. Therefore, a detailed matrix structure was composed in which the different elements or entries of the matrix were identified and a tentative rough set up was made. The inventory includes current commodities and new cellulose containing and raw materials as well as exotic sources and specialties. Important chemical and physical properties of the different raw materials were identified for the use in processes and products. When available, the market data such as price and availability were recorded. Established and innovative cellulose extraction and refining processes were reviewed. The demands on the raw material for suitable processing were collected. Processing parameters known to affect the cellulose properties were listed. Current and expected emerging markets were surveyed as well as their different demands on cellulose raw materials and processes. The setting up of the cellulose matrix as a practical tool requires two steps. Firstly, the reduction of the needed data by clustering of the characteristics of raw materials, processes and markets and secondly, the building of a database that can provide the answers to the questions from stakeholders with an indicative character. This paper describes the steps taken to achieve the defined clusters of most relevant and characteristic properties. These data can be expanded where required. More detailed specification can be obtained from the background literature and handbooks. Where gaps of information are identified, the research questions can be defined that will require further investigation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and reduce the bullwhip effect in fuzzy environments by means of type-2 fuzzy methodology. In order to reduce the bullwhip effect in a supply chain, we propose a new method for demand forecasting. First, the demand data of a real steel industry in Canada is clustered with an interval type-2 fuzzy c-regression clustering algorithm. Then, a novel interval type-2 fuzzy hybrid expert system is developed for demand forecasting. This system uses Fuzzy Disjunctive Normal Forms (FDNF) and Fuzzy Conjunctive Normal Forms (FCNF) for the aggregation of antecedents. An interval type- 2 fuzzy order policy is developed to determine orders in the supply chain. Then, the results of the proposed method are compared with the type-1 fuzzy expert system as well as the type-1 fuzzy time series method in the literature. The results show that the bullwhip effect is significantly reduced; also, the system has less error and high accuracy. © 2013 Sharif University of Technology. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The supply planning of agricultural products and in particular perishable products is a critical issue in the supply chain management field due to high safety and quality risks associated with the delays in the products delivery. This work is concerned with the planning of a real agri-food supply chain for poultry products. More precisely the problem is to redesign the existing supply chain and to optimize the distribution planning. To this aim a clustering-based location-routing model is applied in a sequential manner. Furthermore, environmental costs of road transportation in terms of CO2 emissions are taken into account in the computations. The proposed integrated approach permits to minimise the total costs of the agri-food supply chain not only in terms of economy but also in terms of ecology. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={Trajectory data streams are huge amounts of data pertaining to time and position of moving objects. They are continuously generated by different sources exploiting a wide variety of technologies (e.g., RFID tags, GPS, GSM networks). Mining such amount of data is a challenging problem, since the possibility to extract useful information from this peculiar kind of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, hand-off in cellular networks, supply chain management. Moreover, spatial data streams pose interesting challenges for their proper representation, thus making the mining process harder than for classical point data. In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory data streams clustering, that revealed really intriguing as we deal with a kind of data (trajectories) for which the order of elements is relevant. We propose a complete framework starting from data preparation task that allows us to make the mining step quite effective. Since the validation of data mining approaches has to be experimental we performed several tests on real world datasets that confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Due to the intensely increasing individualized and rapidly changing demand in global market, customer oriented design has been the top priority for modern enterprises to quickly respond to the volatile personalized requirements. This leads to the great change of mass customization in supply chain management, in which the agility, efficiency and cost have become the main impediment to improve supply chain's performance. In this paper, we first propose a new method of adaptive clustering for the orientation and analysis of target customers that is originally inspired from the swarm intelligence of ant colony, then the recommendation system for the design of LCD-TV is illustrated that applied by this method to test the validity of the algorithm. After that, we present a supply chain management based on mobile agents to satisfy the customization, especially, detailed description of the agentbased supply chain process is also expounded.

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to examine logistics infrastructure, trade differences, and environmental and social equity factors, for a set of 89 countries. Design/methodology/approach: Following recent work which uses secondary data sources for supply chain research at the country-level, data were obtained from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund databases. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to compute country-level efficiencies and ANOVA was used to do regional comparisons. Findings: The analysis shed light on country-level dimensions of logistics infrastructure and trade performance. It also provided insights regarding environmental (e.g. CO2 emissions) and social equity (e.g. health expenditure) dimensions for different regions. Research limitations/implications: Panel data rather than longitudinal data were used to draw the conclusions. A more exhaustive study could consider a multi-year timeframe. A limited number of dimensions were examined. As the study was exploratory, further work could consider a more extensive number of dimensions. Practical implications: The study has important implications for policy makers, since the attractiveness of various resource endowments like those considered here (environmental, social, supply chain logistics) can be seen to be associated with trade performance. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies to explore efficiency differences (enacted through DEA and ANOVA analyses), differentiating the research from the usual country clustering approaches. It also contributes to the understanding of differences between countries from a macro perspective, which provides insights for firms intending to expand their supply chains. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Performance evaluation of suppliers is increasingly recognized as a critical indicator in supply chain cooperation. Traditional performance evaluation methods have the problems of a simple buy/sell relation and in one's subjective views between manufacturers and suppliers, and they lack objective automatic evaluation processes in the supply chain considered. Statistical techniques used for evaluation rely on the restrictive assumptions of linear separability, multivariate normality, and independence of the predictive variables. Unfortunately, many of the common models of performance evaluation of suppliers violate these assumptions. The study proposes an integrated model by combining K-means clustering, feature selection, and the decision tree method into a single evaluation model to assess the performance of suppliers and simultaneously tackles the abovementioned shortcomings. The integrated model is illustrated with an empirical case study of a manufacturer for an original design manufacturer (ODM) to demonstrate the model performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms listed methods in terms of accuracy, and three redundant attributes can be eliminated from the empirical case. Furthermore, the extracted rules by the decision tree C4.5 algorithm form an automatic knowledge system for supplier performance evaluation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the B2B e-commerce (B2BEC) usage patterns of North American small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their supply chains, the contextual factors that influence usage patterns, and the subsequent effects of these patterns on firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted an online survey of North American SMEs and obtained 229 responses. They utilized several statistical methods, including cluster analysis and profile analysis, to test five hypotheses. Findings - The TOE framework, supplemented with interorganizational factors, provides a valid theoretical guideline to study firms' B2BEC usage patterns. Three distinct types of B2BEC usage patterns - E-Limiteds, E-Leaders, and E-Laggards - emerged. Different sets of contextual factors contribute to the formation of these three patterns of B2BEC adoption. Higher levels of B2BEC usage result in stronger firm performance. Research limitations/implications - Future clustering variables could be more specific. The effects of other potential contextual factors should also be explored by future studies. This study can be replicated in other countries to determine whether the findings can be generalized. Practical implications - In light of the potential performance improvements that B2BEC adoption offers, managers should assess the risks associated with maintaining their current speed of e-business deployment versus the risks associated with escalating it. Organizations that have been more reactive should consider how well or ill their sluggish approach prepares them for navigating the inevitability of increasing sophistication in supply chain management. Originality/value - Limited empirical research exists on theB2BECusage patterns of NorthAmerican SMEs, the contextual factors that motivate them to adopt different B2BEC technologies in their supply chains, and how each of these usage patterns affects their performance. The current study contributes to the literature by shedding light on these issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Rogue seasonality or unintended cyclic variability in order and other supply chain variables is an endogenous disturbance generated by a companys internal processes such as inventory and production control systems. The ability to automatically detect, diagnose and discriminate rogue seasonality from exogenous disturbances is of prime importance to decision makers. This paper compares the effectiveness of alternative time series techniques based on Fourier and discrete wavelet transforms, autocorrelation and cross correlation functions and autoregressive model in detecting rogue seasonality. Rogue seasonalities of various intensities were generated using different simulation designs and demand patterns to evaluate each of these techniques. An index for rogue seasonality, based on the clustering profile of the supply chain variables was defined and used in the evaluation. The Fourier transform technique was found to be the most effective for rogue seasonality detection, which was also subsequently validated using data from a steel supply network. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Global supply chains have a distinct geography that involves the dimensions of production, distribution and consumption. This geography, at the heart of many sourcing strategies, is often neglected by supply chain managers, or at least scholars investigating supply chain management. However, this essay underlines that this geography reveals patterns that depict well the organization and structure of outsourcing with distribution systems supporting the dichotomy between the geography of production and consumption. Significant segments of supply chain management exist solely to support this spatial divergence. Global processes are also reflected in regional structures and the case of third party logistics providers is investigated. Depending on the gateway and the type of supply chain being serviced, North American 3PLs display a clustering that is particularly prevalent around airport terminals and crossborder ports of entry.

abstract={The current paper presents a comprehensive methodology for supplier selection. In the first stage, the linguistic values expressed as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to assess the weights of the criteria. The Axiomatic Fuzzy Set clustering (AFS) method, which handles ambiguity and fuzziness in the supplier selection problem effectively, is applied to cluster the suppliers and evaluate each potential supplier that aims at obtaining initial supplier ranking. In the second stage, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) model is constructed to determine the weight of various quantitative and qualitative criteria. To address multiple decision criteria in supplier ranking, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is employed to select the final suppliers. A numerical example composed of 30 suppliers and 6 criteria is studied, and the experimental results show that the proposed evaluation framework is suitable for supplier selection decisions even with the dependent criteria/attributes. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

abstract={Hostile environmental pressure on supply chain management increases emphasis on supply chain agility, integration, and visibility to respond rapidly, effectively and efficiently to changes in the marketplace. There is a need for new methods and tools to visualize the supply chain topologies which captures and recognizes the complexity of the supply chain network. This paper presents a Knowledge-based Customization System for Supply Chain Integration (KCSSI) which is developed based on three core technologies: visualization of topologies, network analysis, and knowledge-based system so as to obtain quantified actionable information and formulating strategies for supply chain configuration leading the long term success. The performance of the system is verified by a series of controlled simulation experiments conducted in a selected reference site. It is verified that the KCSSI improves supply chain visibility by recognizing the structure clustering and interconnection of the supply chain network, quantifying and exploiting holistic supply chain performance to provide measurable insights for the customization of the supply chain configuration leading to long term success. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Multi-objective optimization (MOO) has recently attracted an increasing interest in environmental engineering. One major limitation of the existing solution methods for MOO is that their computational burden tends to grow rapidly in size with the number of environmental objectives. In this paper, we study the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify redundant environmental metrics in MOO that can be omitted without disturbing the main features of the problem, thereby reducing the associated complexity. We show that, besides its numerical usefulness, the use of PCA coupled with MOO provides valuable insights on the relationships between environmental indicators of concern for decision-makers. The capabilities of the proposed approach are illustrated through its application to the design of environmentally conscious chemical supply chains (SCs). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose–The purpose of this paper is to develop a forecasting model for retailers based on customer segmentation, to improve performance of inventory. Design/methodology/approach–The research makes an attempt to capture the knowledge of segmenting the customers based on various attributes as an input to the demand forecasting in a retail store. The paper suggests a data mining model which has been used for forecasting of demand. The proposed model has been applied for forecasting demands of eight SKUs for grocery items in a supermarket. Based on the proposed forecasting model, the inventory performance has been studied with simulation. Findings–The proposed forecasting model with the inventory replenishment system results in the reduction of inventory level and increase in customer service level. Hence, the proposed model in the paper results in improved performance of inventory. Practical implicationsRetailers can make use of the proposed model for demand forecasting of various items to improve the inventory performance and profitability of operations. Originality/value–With the advent of data mining systems which have given rise to the use of business intelligence in various domains, the current paper addresses one of the most pressing issues in retail management, as demand forecasting with minimum error is the key to success in inventory and supply chain management. The proposed forecasting model with the inventory replenishment system results in the reduction of inventory level and increase in customer service level. The proposed model outperforms other widely used existing models. © 2012, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This article outlines a hybrid method, incorporating multiple techniques into an evaluation process, in order to select competitive suppliers in a supply chain. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) model is constructed to calculate the weight of various factors, and get comprehensive character value. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is present to decide the backup suppliers. By performing Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) clustering method (X. D. Liu et al. IEEE Transaction on Systems, Man, Cybernetics, 2005), the final suppliers are selected and evaluated. In this paper, quantitative and qualitative factors' such as technical capability, product appearance, JIT capability, price, delivery rate and sale service rate are considered to determine suitable suppliers. Numerical example that fifteen suppliers and six criteria are studied and the experimental results show that the proposed evaluation framework is very well suited as supplier selection decisions even with the inter-correlation criteria/attributes. © 2012 TFSA.},

abstract={Vendor selection is a strategic issue in supply-chain management for any organization to identify the right supplier. Such selection in most cases is based on the analysis of some specific criteria. Most of the researches so far concentrate on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis. However, it incurs a huge computational complexity when a large number of suppliers are considered. So, data mining approaches would be required to convert raw data into useful information and knowledge. Hence, a new hybrid model of MCDM and data mining approaches was proposed in this research to address the supplier selection problem. In this paper, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering as a data mining model has been used to cluster suppliers into groups. Then, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE) method has been employed to rank the suppliers. The efficiency of this method was revealed by conducting a case study in an automotive industry. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={An accurate demand forecasting model has academic and practical significance to supply chain management. However, multi-source data and error data have great effect on the demand prediction accuracy. Therefore, a balanced-sampling-based ensemble of heterogeneous support vector regression forecasting method named BS-EnHSVR (Balanced-Sampling-based Ensemble of Heterogeneous SVR) is proposed in this paper to improve the prediction accuracy by employing balanced sampling and heterogeneous ensemble learning techniques. Training dataset is firstly classified to different clusters by using clustering algorithm, and then sample data from each cluster equally to generate training subset for training different individual SVR models with different training parameters for ensemble. Experimental results on beer sales show that the proposed method has good usability and generalization ability. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In the last decades, supply chain management (SCM) has become a significant issue in real life and in the literature due to increasing globalisation. Moreover, supplier selection and periodical evaluation has become an important tool for the companies in order to maintain an effective SCM. The main goal of this study is to construct an integrated method to build a decision support system for supplier evaluation and selection that incorporates quantitative and qualitative calculations together to deal with vague and uncertain data available to decision makers. A methodology, which is capable of evaluating and monitoring suppliers' performance, is constructed, using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to weight the established decision criteria and ELECTRE III to evaluate, rank and classify performance of suppliers regarding relative criteria. The proposed methodology is applied to a real-life supplier-selection and classification problem of a pharmaceutical company. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The management of contemporary supply chains is complex because of their stochastic and dynamic nature. Also, modern supply chains are imbibed with agile characteristics. Several technologies have emerged for the management of agile supply chains. But most of them are in development stages. No common method exists for evaluating agility in supply chains by both researchers and practitioners. The complex manufacturing systems necessitate the validation of innovative solutions using advanced managerial tools and techniques. The manufacturing paradigms have to be evaluated according to their short term action and long term benefits. This article reports the utilisation of fuzzy association rules mining (FARM) approach which enables the decision makers to make flexible decisions for evaluating agility in supply chains in the presence of attributes such as flexibility, profitability, quality, innovativeness, pro-activity, speed of response, cost and robustness. The approach has been applied in an Indian electronic switches manufacturing organisation. The experiences of the conduct of this research indicate that agility evaluation can be performed without constraints by the decision makers. The case study is being demonstrated in which agility of supply chains is evaluated by determining association rules from the database. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The literature suggests a growing interest in the application of network analysis in supply chain management. However this has been at the organizational rather than the process level. We believe there is value in applying such analysis to internal processes in supply chain networks. This study uses network analysis techniques to investigate the Stewart [8] framework for excellence in supply chains which considers the impact of delivery performance, flexibility and responsiveness, logistics cost and assets management. We analyze traditional process flow charts as a network in which nodes represent processes, and links between processes have values associated with dimensions of excellence. The supply chain is analyzed and viewed using measures of centrality and clustering related to the dimensions of excellence, and compared with traditional perceptions of the same processes which are more related to time criticality. Overall, the study indicates that traditional means of managing supply chains are not only unfocused in terms of excellence, but are compromised through inability to recognize the importance of various process groups, with a serious mismatch of resourcing as a result. The study provides early findings supporting the future development of a methodology to better manage supply chains using network analysis, in particular to better prioritize resources on critical processes. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Trajectory data refer to time and position of moving objects generated by different sources using a wide variety of technologies (e.g., RFID tags, GPS, GSM networks). Mining such amounts of data is challenging, since the possibility to extract useful information from these peculiar kind of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, hand-off in cellular networks and supply chain management. In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory data streams clustering, that revealed really challenging as we deal with data (trajectories) for which the order of elements is relevant. We propose a complete framework starting from data preparation task that allows us to make the mining step quite effective. Since the validation of data mining approaches has to be experimental we performed several tests on real world datasets that confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Compared with the supply chain of manufacturing industry, we found it feasible to implement supply chain management in the construction industry and analyzed the obstacles in it. Finally, it pointed out that the clustering of construction materials, information technology, business process reengineering, outsourcing of projects logistics and so on were the basis of constructing supply chain management of the construction enterprise, and accordingly the joint-design supply chain model of the project cost-oriented and the responsiveness-oriented was established. © 2011 Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract={For an effective and timely acquisition, deployment, and distribution of needed resources in emergencies, it is crucial to provide the end-to-end visibility of emergency response supply chain to the involved parties and improve its operation management. There are so many factors whose assessment is fuzzy needed to be taken into account when operation management of emergency response supply chain is selected. A fuzzy hierarchical model is presented in this paper based on Analytic Hierarchy Process and Fuzzy Logic on consideration of technical parameters, technical program. By calculation comparison of indicators operation organizations are prioritized from their comprehensive assessment where systems' operation are classified into proper usage scopes and suitable operation systems are recommended. In the end, an optimization framework of operation management of emergency response supply chain based on fuzzy clustering is suggested. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Purchasing is one of the most important supply chain processes which its improvement affects on the whole supply chain's performance. The most critical stage of this process is the best supplier selection, while considering probable changes in candidates' specifications during time and the costs and computational time of selection. In this paper, we propose a context aware system via data clustering algorithms for dynamic selection. Our proposed model only considers the unsteady clusters instead of all clusters, runs the selection algorithm on the best set of suppliers from the previous decision period and reduces the time of selection process while achieving an acceptable purchasing cost. We design an e-shopping website for Internet-based trading citrus product. While suppliers introduce themselves in some properties and show their changed specifications through this website, customers can also order their needs by features determination. Implementing this system which provides direct communication between supplier and consumer, will save time and cost, and provide profitability for the entire supply chain. © 2011 MIPRO.},

abstract={In certain design problems, the solution can have collective implications that are experienced by a number of different people with different responsibilities a team of decision-makers. In such cases, the design problem should be addressed in a collective manner, so that everyone's considerations are taken into account. Unfortunately, even though there is a vast body of literature on simulation optimization, which is widely used to solve the design problems encountered in practice, the existing research generally concentrates on providing a single solution that is optimized according to one or more performance measures. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining the values of several decision variables of a design problem where several decision-makers are involved, who have different preferences for the final solution. The different designers' considerations may not be all known in advance or may not be included in the simulation model, but can only be examined once a candidate solution is proposed. To cope with such difficulties, we propose a two-stage approach. It is first necessary to find a set of different enough designs that can be considered efficient in terms of performance. The solutions can afterwards be passed on to the decision-makers and the most appropriate one can be decided on according to their preferences. We use the crowding clustering genetic algorithm (CCGA) to solve the first sub-problem, where the performances of the candidate designs are evaluated using simulation. We address the second sub-problem with a multiplicative variant of the popular analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which does not suffer from the dependence on irrelevant alternatives as the original version. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed two-stage approach on a supply chain design problem. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Trajectory data streams are huge amounts of data pertaining to time and position of moving objects. They are continuously generated by different sources exploiting a wide variety of technologies (e.g., RFID tags, GPS, GSM networks). Mining such amounts of data is challenging, since the possibility to extract useful information from this peculiar kind of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, hand-off in cellular networks, supply chain management. Moreover, spatial data streams poses interesting challenges both for their proper definition and acquisition, thus making the mining process harder than for classical point data. In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory data streams clustering, that revealed really challenging as we deal with data (trajectories) for which the order of elements is relevant. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In every production process, suppliers have to decide whether an item should be produced and stored as inventory before an explicit purchase order is received (production in advance), or whether it should be produced only after such an order is received (production to order). We study the determinants of this firm-level choice. We present a simple conceptual framework to derive predictions that we subsequently test in the empirical analysis. We argue that an increment in buyers' spatial concentration benefits production in advance more in homogenous industries than in differentiated ones, while the benefits for production to order are larger as product differentiation increases. Consequently, the propensity to adopt one of the two production modes, following an increase in the number of local downstream buyers, changes according to the degree of product differentiation of the goods. Relying on a large data set of Italian manufacturing firms, we find empirical support to our ideas. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Complex event processing (CEP) over event streams has become increasingly important for real-time applications ranging from health care, supply chain management to business intelligence. These monitoring applications submit complex queries to track sequences of events that match a given pattern. As these systems mature the need for increasingly complex nested sequence query support arises, while the state-of-art CEP systems mostly support the execution of flat sequence queries only. To assure real-time responsiveness and scalability for pattern detection even on huge volume high-speed streams, efficient processing techniques must be designed. In this paper, we first analyze the prevailing nested pattern query processing strategy and identify several serious shortcomings. Not only are substantial subsequences first constructed just to be subsequently discarded, but also opportunities for shared execution of nested subexpressions are overlooked. As foundation, we introduce NEEL, a CEP query language for expressing nested CEP pattern queries composed of sequence, negation, AND and OR operators. To overcome deficiencies, we design rewriting rules for pushing negation into inner subexpressions. Next, we devise a normalization procedure that employs these rules for flattening a nested complex event expression. To conserve CPU and memory consumption, we propose several strategies for efficient shared processing of groups of normalized NEEL subexpressions. These strategies include prefix caching, suffix clustering and customized bit-marking execution strategies. We design an optimizer to partition the set of all CEP subexpressions in a NEEL normal form into groups, each of which can then be mapped to one of our shared execution operators. Lastly, we evaluate our technologies by conducting a performance study to assess the CPU processing time using real-world stock trades data. Our results confirm that our NEEL execution in many cases performs 100 fold faster than the traditional iterative nested execution strategy for real stock market query workloads. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In many telecom and web applications, there is a need to identify whether data objects in the same source or different sources represent the same entity in the real-world. This problem arises for subscribers in multiple services, customers in supply chain management, and users in social networks when there lacks a unique identifier across multiple data sources to represent a real-world entity. Entity resolution is to identify and discover objects in the data sets that refer to the same entity in the real world. We investigate the entity resolution problem for large data sets where efficient and scalable solutions are needed. We propose a novel unsupervised blocking algorithm, namely SPectrAl Neighborhood (SPAN), which constructs a fast bipartition tree for the records based on spectral clustering such that real entities can be identified accurately by neighborhood records in the tree. There are two major novel aspects in our approach: 1)We develop a fast algorithm that performs spectral clustering without computing pairwise similarities explicitly, which dramatically improves the scalability of the standard spectral clustering algorithm; 2) We utilize a stopping criterion specified by Newman-Girvan modularity in the bipartition process. Our experimental results with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that SPAN is robust and outperforms other blocking algorithms in terms of accuracy while it is efficient and scalable to deal with large data sets. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This study addresses a facility location and task allocation problem of a two-echelon supply chain against stochastic demand. Decisions include locating a number of factories among a finite set of potential sites and allocating task assignment between factories and marketplaces to maximize profit. The study represents the addressed location-allocation problem by bi-level stochastic programming and develops a genetic algorithm with efficient greedy heuristics to solve the problem. The contribution of the study pivots on a formal representation of system configuration design and operations optimization for a two-echelon supply chain. The proposed solution algorithm can find near optimal solution while consuming less computational time for large-size problems as compared to an optimization-based tool. In addition, this study investigates the industrial-cluster effect in a two-echelon supply chain by using the proposed algorithm. Experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm can efficiently yield nearly optimal solutions against stochastic demands. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The number of state policies aimed at fostering biomass utilization has proliferated in recent years in the United States. Several states aim to increase the use of forest and agriculture biomass through renewable energy production. Several more indirectly encourage utilization by targeting aspects of the supply chain from trees standing in the forest to goods sold. This research classifies 370 state policies from across the United States that provides incentives for forest biomass utilization. We compare those policies by types of incentives relative to the supply chain and geographic clustering. We then develop a framework for policy evaluation building on the supply chain steps, which can be used to assess intended and unintended consequences of policy interactions. These findings may inform policy development and identify synergies at different steps in the supply chain to enhance forest biomass utilization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks are becoming more and more common. One of the limitations of wireless sensor nodes is their inherent limited energy resource. Besides maximizing the lifetime of the sensor node, it is preferable to increase the trust value of data fusion results. In this paper, a new protocol is introduced, named EETDFCA (an Energy Efficient and Trusted Data Fusion by using Cellular Automata) in Wireless sensor Networks. EETDFCA uses cellular automata rule to find the most suitable cluster head, perform data fusion, find the most trusted neighbors for sending the fusion result to base station, and transforms from current state to a new state. The network is intended for the long-term monitoring of packets produced by jammer nodes. The data flow of the network is mainly toward a cluster head node, which is responsible for collecting data generated by sensor nodes. When the network is first deployed, an initialization algorithm is performed and preliminary clusters, cluster heads and sensors alive are determined. Simulations and results show that the algorithm can extend the lifetime of the wireless sensor network and boost trusted data fusion frequency.},

abstract={Traditional wireless devices communicate directly with a beacon or base station located in range of the device. Multi-hop messages are still a rarity in wireless communication. Wireless sensor network protocols often are based on peer-topeer infrastructure, where messages traverse long distances through the network to reach a certain destination. A flat infrastructure is hard to manage regarding routing and scalability, if number of nodes increase drastically. Because of battery operated nodes, energy-effective mechanisms are very important in wireless sensor networks. Clustering brings hierarchy into the network and can save energy since nodes within a cluster usually communicate locally in a short range. Messages sent to large distances are handled by cluster-heads routing them through an inter-cluster backbone. A heterogeneous infrastructure with a large number of simple and cheap sensor nodes and only a small percentage of more powerful clusterheads is beneficial but not necessary. This paper presents a new clustering approach called Variable Ranges Protocol that provides basic features to modify the range of each node. A dynamic transmission range adaption protocol substantially prolongs the lifetime of the nodes through energy efficient communication without significantly decreasing the node connectivity. The VR protocol is implemented combining several MAC protocols for local communication within a cluster.},

Therefore logistical planning and control processes become more complex. Events in supply networks and their consequences to the partners in the supply network will be hard to overlook without using computer based decision support system. This paper describes such a decision support system that learns rules for controlling a production network. In detail the system architecture will be described, requirements to such a system will be identified and a solution developed at the Heinz Nixdorf Institute in Paderborn will be presented. The solution is based on a Q-learning approach supported by a k-means clustering algorithm.},

abstract={Purpose: Based on prior studies, the performance of customer relationships depends highly on the characteristics of the e-service. However, the strength of this association can be impacted when businesses employ multichannel services (e.g. offering online and offline services). With multichannel services, any inconsistency in perceived quality across channels may result in customer distrust toward a service provider. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of inconsistent quality on the association between e-service quality and customer relationships in a university context. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted a web survey and 318 respondents who have both physical and e-service experiences were collected. The inconsistent quality across channels was divided into three groups by k-means clustering approach. Next, the hypothesized associations were analyzed using regression analysis based on three groups. Findings: The results show that inconsistent quality has different impacts on the association between e-service quality and customer relationships across the three groups. Especially in the positive disconfirmation group, the investment in e-services will be in vain because certain e-service sub-constructs lose their impact on customer relationships. Practical implications: The findings of this study provide implications for improving customer relationships under different cross-channel quality inconsistency conditions for managers. Originality/value: This study extends the concept of expectancy disconfirmation theory to the multichannel service context and pioneers the exploration of the moderating effect of cross-channel quality inconsistency in customer relationships, contributing to the understanding of the literature about the impacts of inconsistent quality on customer relationships. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Supplier selection is one of the critical components of supply chain management and has played a very important role to improve the competitiveness of the entire supply chain. Successful supplier selection may have significant business implications, while how to determine the suitable suppliers is a complex decision making problem which includes both qualitative and quantitative factors. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach that combines the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm with ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to cluster suppliers into manageable smaller groups with similar characteristics. The simulation results show that the proposed method improves the performance of FCM algorithm for it is less sensitive to local extreme. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Presently, modern B2B supply chain management (B2B-SCM) equipped with semi-automated data logging systems accumulate large volumes. However, each SC unit in B2B-SC still individually develops their performance. Besides, their linkages of performance attributes between SC units still lack vital information extraction to improve theirs. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an integrated framework between B2B supply chain (B2B-SC) performance evaluation systems and data mining techniques, developing relationship rules of collaborative performance attribute enhancement. The methodology is as follows. Firstly, B2B-SC performance evaluation questionnaires based on two levels able to characterize collaborative relation between two or more partners in their SC were gathered from the case study companies. The data set of relationships between enterprise and its direct customers of the case study companies in France was used for demonstration. Secondly, data cleaning and preparations for rule extraction were performed on the questionnaire database. The significance of attribute was calculated using attribute ranking algorithms by means of information gain based on ranker search. These results were used to choose the crucial attributes from each micro view. Thirdly, web graph analysis was performed on this data to confirm the strong attribute relationship. Next, association rule was deployed to extract performance attribute relationship rules grounded on support and confidence cross validation method. The quality of each recognized rule is tested and, from numerous rules, only those that are statistically very strong and contain vital information are selected. Last but not least, these rules are interpreted by domain experts and studied by domain engineers to build a collaborative performance attribute enhancement road map. Furthermore, the final rule set of extracted rules contains very interesting information relating to SCs and also point out the critical existing SC attribute improvement. Ultimately, companies in this SC are able to use this framework to design and adjust their units to conform with the exact customer needs.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the logistics industry, Logistics center plays a very important role in a logistics system. And the location is one of the most critical factors for the effective operation of the logistics system. This paper mainly analyzes the multi-logistics centers location problem and proposes a novel approach for solving the problem. The proposed approach is developed on the basis of clustering techniques, and involves three sequential mechanisms including: determining the logistics centers' layout with improved clustering methods based on spatial equilibrium principle firstly, then finding solutions of location problem with the centroid method respectively, finally comparing the solutions and obtaining the best result In addition to methodology development, a case study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Warehouse management plays an important role in every manufacturing company. The inventory provides a buffer for the production plants. The Put-away process is one of the key activities in warehouse operations and has a significant impact on the overall performance of the warehouse. The put-away operation, if done effectively by the warehouse operators, helps the production plant to run smoothly. Warehouse management systems (WMS) can assist the warehouse operators in managing the warehouse. However, the current WMS cannot fulfill the individual warehouse objectives. Due to this drawback, warehouse operators have to rely solely on their knowledge and experience when doing the put-away process. As human beings are involved in the operation, mistakes and inconsistency cannot be avoided. Hence, as described in this paper, a RFID-based fuzzy storage assignment system (R-FSAS) has been developed to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the put-away process by means of formulating feasible and tailor-made storage plans for products coming into a warehouse. Through using R-FSAS, real-time warehouse operations are monitored by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, and a hybrid fuzzy association rule engine is adopted to formulate different storage plans. By applying R-FSAS in a manufacturing company, the overall results illustrate that R-FSAS enhances the efficiency of the put-away process in a warehouse.},

abstract={The increasing availability of huge amounts of data pertaining to time and position of moving objects generated by different sources using a wide variety of technologies (e.g., RFID tags, GPS, GSM networks) leads to large spatial data collections. Mining such amounts of data is challenging, since the possibility to extract useful information from this peculiar kind of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, handoff in cellular networks, supply chain management. Moreover, spatial data poses interesting challenges both for their proper definition and acquisition, thus making the mining process harder than for classical point data. In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory clustering, that revealed really challenging as we deal with data (trajectories) for which the order of elements is relevant. We propose a complete framework starting from data preparation task that allows us to make the mining step quite effective. Since the validation of data mining approaches has to be experimental we performed several tests on real world datasets that confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, manufacturing processes have become more and more complex, manufacturing activities generate large quantities of data, so it is no longer practical to rely on traditional manual methods to analyze this data. Data mining offers tools for extracting knowledge from data, leading to significant improvement in the decision-making process. Association rules mining is one of the most important data mining techniques and has received considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. The paper presents the basic concept of association rule mining and reviews applications of association rules in manufacturing, including product design, manufacturing, process, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and product quality improvement. This paper is focused on demonstrating the relevancy of association rules mining to manufacturing industry, rather than discussing the association rules mining domain in general. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract={Supply chain is a coordinate operation model beyond space and location constraints, so the performance for supply chain partners is not easily amenable for measurement. In this paper, a new evaluation method using fuzzy clustering is put forward. It can perfectly deal with the inherent limitations of supply chain alliance and measure the overall performance during all the work phases of supply chain by linking the key factors from each partner of supply chain alliance. In order to illustrate the viability and adaptability of this method, an example of application is given by this paper. © 2010 IEEE.},

Among the most significant expenses, one involves the distance traveled by operators or S/R machinery for the selection of ordered items; the common solution to which has been through the classification of stored items. Previous articles have focused on linear solutions to the abovementioned problem, such as P-Median. This article shall focus on the problems arising from the said solution, and instead a non-linear method proposed. Further, a heuristic algorithm is produced for the solution that will be compared to similar solutions through Lingo, proving acceptable results. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Much of the construction industry improvement agenda has been focused on achieving integration of the design and construction processes. However, the current approaches do not create an organizational framework to deal with the full integration of the supply chains for component based construction. The real construction supply chain of clients, designers, specialist designers, specialist manufacturers, constructors and assemblers is not integrated into one group with a common purpose. A major and ongoing challenge is to manage the essential grouping of contributors and participants, many of whom are involved for varying times on a relatively short-term basis. Grouping, by using technology clusters, addresses many of these challenges as it creates a commonly shared sub-organization and culture that aids the removal of barriers to efficient and quality production. A technology cluster approach is a management philosophy and its principles can be applied whatever the procurement approach, although managed forms of procurement provide a better framework. Our studies of projects that have adopted a clustering approach have provided an understanding of the implementation issues of technology clusters and established the consequent changes in organizational design and management necessary to achieve full integration of the supply chain. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper presents a new method for regional energy targeting and supply chain synthesis. The method is based on a novel approach to the optimisation of renewable energy supply. A new algorithm for revealing energy supply chain clusters is introduced, described and illustrated by a case study. It has been developed on two levels. The first is a top-level supply chain network with lowest Carbon Footprint generated. It consists of a number of zone clusters. The definition of zones is provided; it can be e.g. a village or a town. Each zone is considered as a unit. At the second level is a supply chain synthesis carried out by P-graph based optimisation within each cluster. It provides a more detailed analysis. The use of the P-graph framework as a synthesis toolset provides a strong mathematically proven fundament for handling the complexity of the synthesis problem. It contributes to the optimal network design with a high computational efficiency. This approach contributes to the cleaner generation of energy from biomass, approaching CO2 neutrality as much as possible. It is beneficial for extending the use of biomass as a renewable source of energy. © 2010.},

abstract={A new method for regional energy targeting and supply chain synthesis is presented. A demand-driven approach is applied to assess the feasible ways for transferring energy from renewable sources to customers in a given region. The studied region is partitioned into a number of clusters by using the developed Regional Energy Clustering (REC) algorithm. The REC targets aim at minimising the system carbon footprint (CFP). The biomass energy supply and management are targeted using new graphical representations. Regional Energy Surplus-Deficit Curves (RESDC) visualises the formation and the sizes of introduced energy clusters. Regional Resource Management Composite Curve (RRMCC) an analogy of the Process Integration approach shows the energy imbalances helping in trading-off resources management. These graphical tools provide straightforward information of how to manage the surplus resources (biomass and land use) in a region. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Optimal inventory control is one of the significant tasks in supply chain management. The optimal inventory control methodologies intend to reduce the supply chain (SC) cost by controlling the inventory in an effective manner, such that, the SC members will not be affected by surplus as well as shortage of inventory. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach that effectively utilizes the Data Mining (DM) concepts as well as Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimal inventory control. The proposed approach consists of two major functions, mining association rules for inventory and selecting SC cost-impact rules. Initially, the association rules are mined from EMA-based inventory data, which is determined from the original historical data. Apriori, a classic data mining algorithm is utilized for mining association rules from EMA-based inventory data. Later, with the aid of genetic algorithm, SC cost-impact rules are selected for every SC member. The obtained SC cost-impact rules will possibly signify the future state of inventory in any SC member. Moreover, the level of holding or reducing the inventory can be determined from the SC cost-impact rules. Thus, the SC cost-impact rules that are derived using the proposed approach greatly facilitate optimal inventory control and hence make the supply chain management more effective.},

abstract={A supply chain is a set of organizations directly linked by flows of services from suppliers to customers. Supply chain activities range from the ordering and receipt of raw materials to the production and distribution of finished goods. Supply chain management is the integration of key activities across a supply chain for the purposes of building competitive infrastructures, synchronizing supply with demand, and leveraging worldwide logistics. This paper addresses the challenges created by supply chain management towards improving long-term performance of companies. It presents a multi-agent supply chain system composed of multiple software agents, each responsible for one or more supply chain activities, and each interacting with other agents in the execution of their responsibilities. Additionally, this paper presents the key features of a negotiation model for software agents. The model handles bilateral multi-issue negotiation and incorporates an alternating offers protocol, a set of logrolling strategies, and a set of negotiation tactics. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a clustering approach to segment supply chain partners in the automobile industry and prioritize services offered by third party logistics service (3PL) providers. Design/methodology/ approach - In total, 98 automobile and auto-parts manufacturers are surveyed to identify service needs, preferences, and outsourcing commitments. By applying a two-stage clustering approach combined with Ward's minimum-variance method and the K-means algorithm, the logistics companies prioritize their services to better satisfy groups of customers with specific preferences. Findings - Four distinctive groups of manufacturers are identified using the two-stage clustering approach. The clusters separate logistic preferences and outsourcing patterns of after market parts suppliers, original equipment service parts suppliers, original equipment manufacturer parts suppliers, and tier one car makers. The paper finds that distribution and delivery services hold the highest percentage of services outsourced among the manufacturers. Originality/value - This paper models logistic services as customizable services and develops a data system methodology to define the profiles of automobile manufacturers and their preferred logistic services. Through the analysis of service preferences and clustering, the paper identifies the key logistic services that can be customized for members of the automobile supply chain. A case is provided which demonstrates how a logistics company can provide customized service designs for specific target markets and customers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Biofuel production has been expanding for more than five years, leading to an increasing number of production sites worldwide and also to a tremendous diversification of processes and approaches to producing biofuel. Such a fast move in industry has sometimes proven in the past to potentially lead to underestimating safety management needs. The significant number of existing facilities producing so called first generation biofuel allows for a reasonable survey of safety issues from incidents. In 2006, INERIS initiated research work devoted to the analysis of safety-related issues including the implementation of an incidents database. Its purpose is to collect known and reasonably well documented incidents (explosions, fires, spills, derailments, and road accidents) that relate to the life cycle of biofuel supply chains. This paper focuses on the analysis of this database, which contains 100 incidents that occurred from January 2000 to early 2009. From the database, an attempt has been made to identify the root factors of incidents potentially impacting biofuel supply chains, using statistical methods like multiple correspondence analysis and ascendant hierarchical clustering. This multivariate analysis exercise has led us to identify five main incident typologies, which in turn allows us to draw appropriate information on safety issues pertaining to first-generation biofuel supply chains. Each typology is illustrated by actual cases of accidents. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Vendor selection is a strategic issue in supply chain management for any organization to identify the right supplier. Such selection in most cases is based on the analysis of some specific criteria. Most of the researches so far concentrate on multi-criteria decisionmaking analysis. Though many approaches have been proposed, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is the most well known as it can deal with a very complex criteria structure. In AHP, the selected criteria are ranked and organized in a hierarchical order from generic to specific to formulate the problem. Though this order of ranking is acceptably logical, it incurs a huge computational complexity when a large number of alternatives are considered as the selection criteria. Moreover, the AHP may generate wrong selection due to computational error. To address these limitations, a novel model namely vendor selection using fuzzy c-means algorithm and analytic hierarchy process (VFA) is presented in this paper by integrating the fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm with analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The outcome of the proposed VFA algorithm is compared with the basic AHP algorithm and VFA outperforms the basic AHP and reduces the computational complexity of AHP by a factor of 7. ©2009 IEEE.},

A demand-driven approach is applied to assess the feasible ways for transferring energy from renewable sources to customers in a given region. The studied region is partitioned into a number of clusters using the Regional Energy Clustering (REC) algorithm. The REC targets aim at minimizing the system carbon footprint. Energy supply chain synthesis is performed within each cluster using the P-graph framework. The synthesis algorithm generated a maximal structure containing all feasible options, from which solution structures were obtained.

abstract={The increasing availability of huge amounts of "thin" data, i.e. data pertaining to time and positions generated by different sources with a wide variety of technologies (e.g., RFID tags, GPS, GSM networks) leads to large spatiotemporal data collections. Mining such amounts of data is challenging, since the possibility to extract useful information from this peculiar kind of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, hand-off in cellular networks, supply chain management. In this paper, we address the clustering of spatial trajectories. In the context of trajectory data, this problem is even more challenging than in the classical transactions, as here we deal with data (trajectories) in which the order of items is relevant. We propose a novel approach based on a suitable regioning strategy and an efficient clustering technique based on edit distance. Experiments performed on real world datasets have confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Unascertained means clustering methodology combines unascertained theory and clustering theory to construct unascertained measurements which measures the degree of collective affiliation between samples and category. By considering both financial and non-financial factors, this paper constructs a green supply chain performance evaluation system which contains 17 secondary indicators based on financial condition, customer service, operation flow and degree of green. According to this system, we apply the unascertained means clustering methodology to evaluate the performance of green supply chain, derive the clustering results and present the degree of affiliation of the samples. Unascertained average clustering theory solved the classification problem of green supply chain performance as well as improving the credibility of the evaluation. Finally, this paper ends up with the discussion of the feasibility and effectiveness of this system. ©2009 IEEE.},

Firstly, it puts forward the algorithm and process of neural network based on fuzzy clustering. Secondly, the memberships of subclass are acquired through clustering the elements based on fuzzy clustering. Then, the memberships are passed into the neural network to study by the form of the input. Finally, the main elements and their weights are acquired and discovered through studying.

abstract={At present, more and more researches are focused on material requirement planning (MRP), which is an important role in supply chain management. In this paper, a new approach for material requirement planning is proposed based on data field and cloud model, which can find out the important materials automatically in supply chain material requirement planning. The clustering method by data field is based on the distribution of equipotential line (surface) of the natural nested data structures in the field and the aggregation properties of self-organization among data objects to achieve the level division. The use of cloud model to describe the characteristics of the concept for clustering results on material requirement planning is not limited by the amount of data and dimension, and it can effectively reflect the clustering the uncertainty of knowledge, especially the randomness and fuzziness. An actual case study and its results analysis are given based on the proposed model. The results show that this approach is effective and feasible in the area of supply chain material requirement planning.},

abstract={The increasing availability of huge amounts of "thin" data, i.e. data pertaining to time and positions generated by different sources with a wide variety of technologies (e.g., RFID tags, GPS, GSM networks) leads to large spatio-temporal data collections. Mining such amounts of data is challenging, since the possibility of extracting useful information from this particular type of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, hand-off in cellular networks and supply chain management. In this paper, we address the issue of clustering spatial trajectories. In the context of trajectory data, this problem is even more challenging than in classical transactional relationships, as here we deal with data (trajectories) in which the order of items is relevant. We propose a novel approach based on a suitable regioning strategy and an efficient clustering technique based on edit distance. Experiments performed on real world datasets have confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In today's competitive environment, business organizations are forced to maintain their competitive advantage by their ability to cut costs, increase revenue and uncover hidden issues. In order to enhance the visibility and transparency of value added information in a supply chain network, a process mining system is proposed for discovering a set of fuzzy association rules based on the daily captured logistics operation data, within the network. The proposed methodology provides all levels of employees with the ability to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the current business environment. Once interesting association rules have been extracted, organizations can identify the root-causes of quality problems in a supply chain and improve performance by fine-tuning the configuration of process parameters in specified processes. The application of the proposed methodology in a case company has also been studied. The prototype system has been developed and evaluated after performing a spatial analysis. The results obtained indicate that the system is capable of extracting high-quality and actionable information in the case company. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Demand chain management (DCM) can be defined as "extending the view of operations from a single business unit or a company to the whole chain. Essentially, demand chain management focuses not only on generating drawing power from customers to purchase merchandises on the supply chain; but also on exploring satisfaction, participation, and involvement from customers in order for enterprises to understand customer needs and wants. Thus, customers have changed their position in the demand chain to assume a leading role in bringing more benefit for enterprises. This article investigates what functionalities best fit the consumers' needs and wants for life insurance products by extracting specific knowledge patterns and rules from consumers and their demand chain. By doing so, this paper uses the a priori algorithm and clustering analysis as methodologies for data mining. Knowledge extraction from data mining results is illustrated as market segments and demand chain analysis on life insurance market in Taiwan in order to propose suggestions and solutions to the insurance firms for new product development and marketing. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Purpose - In the light of lessons learned from recent disasters (The London subway bombings, and Hurricane Katrina), it has become increasingly clear that supply chain partners as well as government agencies need to be prepared to communicate effectively to consumers and customers before, during and after a disaster. Effective communication can minimize confusion and harm to company reputations, to consumers, the economy and the nation. Incorporating consistent communications into supply chain management (SCM) plans used by all parties in the supply chain will enhance competitiveness of the whole chain and speed recovery from potentially disastrous events. Findings from a national survey of consumer's attitudes about terrorism provide information about the development of targeted and effective communications. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a survey of more than 4,000 US consumers, this study used "predictive segmentation" which consists of a canonical factor analysis relating general consumer attitudes and values to their more specific fears and concerns about terrorism. A clustering of consumers then identifies six diverse consumer segments providing a framework for the development of communication strategies. Findings - Results from this study demonstrate that people can be grouped based on their general attitudes and values in such a way that their diversity can be captured in a simple framework of segments each reflecting striking differences in the level of concern over potential terrorist attacks. Practical implications - Guidance is offered for the development of communication strategies based on the information needs and media behavior of each consumer segment to mitigate the impact of a potential terrorist attack or catastrophic food safety breaches.It provides practical and logical extension of former studies that suggest incorporating consumers, attitudes into SCM and business continuity plans. Originality/value - This study leverages a common and proven marketing research approach - segmentation - used in private industry for the marketing of goods and service. It applies this method to defining segments of consumers based on their attitudes and concerns about terrorism that will be useful in supply chain communication management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Essential characteristics and criteria of suppliers are identified that must be considered in the supplier selection process. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is shown to be the appropriate methodology for evaluating and ranking potential suppliers. Supplier selection is not only a significant work in supply chain management but also a complex decision making problem which includes both qualitative and quantitative factors. Association rule mining is widely used data mining technology that searches through data set for rules revealing the nature and frequency of relationships between data entities. Mostly, there will be thousands of potential suppliers and a complicated process of determining a satisfactory subset based on many essential factors. In this article, the key supplier selection can be viewed as the problem of ranking the candidate supplier and mining a large of database of shipment. This search can be integrated AHP with association rule mining. The paper has employed a numerical example for the integrated method for suitable supplier set. The results show that the method is effective and feasible. 1553-9105/ Copyright © 2009 Binary Information Press.},

abstract={Nowadays, how to recognize the importance of customers is a key factor in assuring the success of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in e-supply chain. The paper firstly introduces the basic principle of SOM Neural Network. Secondly, it takes the improved SOM Clustering Algorithm as a tool to cluster and divide the customers in e-supply chain into different groups objectively and scientifically. The result of research strongly proved and supported the ''Pareto 80/20-principle''. Lastly, through clustering customers to each different group and recognizing the level of importance of customers in different groups (esp. the 20% VIP), there is some good suggestions to be put forward. It would be helpful to make some aimed marketing strategy for promotion, service, price etc and avoid the risk of taking the uniform-service strategy for all the customers or taking the subjective and unscienti-fic rank-service strategy to lose the potential VIP customers. Customers clustering analyze based on Neural Network is a comparatively novel method in CRM of e-supply Chain of books. © 2009 Binary Information Press March, 2009.},

abstract={Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been dominant learning techniques for more than ten years, and mostly applied to supervised learning problems. These years two-class unsupervised and semi-supervised classification algorithms based on Bounded C-SVMs, Bounded ν-SVMs, Lagrangian SVMs (LSVMs) and robust version to Bounded C∈- SVMs respectively, and which are relaxed to Semi-definite Programming (SDP), get good classification results. The time consumed of method based on robust version to BC-SVMs is too long. So it seems necessary to find a faster method, which has almost accurate results as above at least. Therefore we proposed robust version to unsupervised and semi-supervised classification algorithms based on Lagrangian Support Vector Machines and its application on evaluation of supply chain management performance. Numerical results confirm the robustness of the proposed method and show that our new unsupervised and semi-supervised classification algorithms based on LSVMs often obtain almost the same accurate results as other algorithms,while considerably faster than them. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Customers benefit from the ability to select their desired options to configure final products. Manufacturing companies, however, struggle with the dilemma of product diversity and manufacturing complexity. It is important, therefore, for them to capture correlations among the options provided to the customers. In this paper, a data mining approach is applied to manage product diversity and complexity. Rules are extracted from historical sales data and used to form sub-assemblies as well as product configurations. Methods for discovering frequently ordered product sub-assemblies and product configurations from 'if-then' rules are discussed separately. The development of the sub-assemblies and configurations allows for effective management of enterprise resources, contributes to the innovative design of new products, and streamlines manufacturing and supply chain processes. The ideas introduced in this paper are illustrated with examples and an industrial case study.},

The method is applied on clustering of supply chain partners selection, which shows that the RVPK has stronger searching ability, better stability and higher precision compared with related methods. The corporation could discover the potential partners by the advantages or the characters of corporations in the clusters according to the results and decide the primary supply chain partners. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Market competition in 21st century has evolved to the competition between the supply chains or between industry regions. There is a high degree of interdependence between group enterprises in same supply chain. Facing the strong competition in the marketplaces, these enterprises tend to either develop more centrally for reducing the trade costs, when they are located in the different regions, or make investments in other regions when industries clusters becomes uneconomically. Under this background, there have been across-regions clustering investment based on industrial cluster-oriented. With many differences from monomer investment, this kind of investment is to maintain or acquire clustering advantages. Therefore its dynamics is different from monomer investment. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Making use of clustering technology to segment customers properly is the most important problem. The two most frequently used algorithms are the K-mean and the SOM algorithm. In this paper, a novel unsupervised clustering technology-ISODATA algorithm is proposed for the customer segment based on the customer's purchasing behavior. Unlike the K-mean algorithm, the clusters are merged if either the number of members in a cluster is less than a certain threshold or if the centers of two clusters are closer than a certain threshold in our method. On the contrast, the clusters are split into two different clusters if the cluster standard deviation exceeds a predefined value and the number of members is twice the threshold for the minimum number of members. It has some further refinements by splitting and merging of clusters. The customer clustering will be illustrated through a case study on the e- commerce database of bookshop. ©2008 IEEE.},

abstract={The unlimited growth of supply chain finance data will inevitably lead to a situation in which it is increasingly difficult to access the desired information. Supply chain finance is often necessary to analyze large data sets, maintained over geographically bank, supplier and customer distributed sites by using cooperative context-aware distributed data mining (DDM) systems. The study of the existing approaches shows that no single solution fulfills all requirements identified for the cooperative context-aware DDM systems. One of the basic obstacles is the lack of context-aware and supporting some of the computational resources - such as data and information bases, computational models, compute power to execute these models, specialized data mining algorithms - required to develop a new compound is not available locally, but accessible via the global computing network infrastructure. This paper proposes a multi-agent-based architecture for supply chain finance cooperative distributed data mining systems. The use of multi-agent-systems (MAS) creates a framework which allows the inter-operation of a vast set of heterogeneous solutions to carry out the complex supply chain finance context-aware distributed data mining tasks, many data mining tasks to connect heterogeneous resources, as data sources, processing nodes and end user applications. It considers a data warehousing that supports context-aware OLAP queries, ensuring the interoperability of all data sources, and then focuses on distributed clustering algorithms and some potential applications in multi-agent-based problem solving scenarios. Finally, we outline the implementation of a prototype for shoes manufacturing. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Besides its effectiveness, supply chain management (SCM) is a complex process because of the stochastic and dynamic nature, multi-criterion and ever-increasing complexity of supply chains. Furthermore, companies have realized that agility is essential for their survival and competitiveness. Consequently, there is no generally accepted method by researchers and practitioners for designing, operating and evaluating agile supply chains. Moreover, the ability to build agile supply chain has developed more slowly than anticipated, because technology for managing agile supply chain is still being developed. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a new approach based on Fuzzy Association Rule Mining to support the decision makers by enhancing the flexibility in making decisions for evaluating agility with both tangibles and intangibles attributes/criteria such as Flexibility, Profitability, Quality, Innovativeness, Pro-activity, Speed of response, Cost and Robustness. Also, by checking the fuzzy classification rules, the goal of knowledge acquisition can be achieved in a framework in which evaluation of agility could be established without constraints, and consequently checked and compared in several details. Efficacy and intricacy of the proposed approach for finding fuzzy association rules from the database for evaluating agility is demonstrated with the help of a numerical example. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Automated negotiation systems with software agents representing individuals or organizations and capable of reaching agreements through negotiation are becoming increasingly important and pervasive. Examples, to mention a few, include the industrial trend toward agent-based supply chain management, the business trend toward virtual enterprises, and the pivotal role that electronic commerce is increasingly assuming in many organizations. Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have paid a great deal of attention to automated negotiation over the past decade and a number of prominent models have been proposed in the literature. These models exhibit fairly different features, make use of a diverse range of concepts, and show performance characteristics that vary significantly depending on the negotiation context. As a consequence, assessing and relating individual research contributions is a difficult task. Currently, there is a need to build a framework to define and characterize the essential features that are necessary to conduct automated negotiation and to compare the usage of key concepts in different publications. Furthermore, the development of such a framework can be an important step to identify the core elements of autonomous negotiating agents, to provide a coherent set of concepts related to automated negotiation, to assess progress in the field, and to highlight new research directions. Accordingly, this paper introduces a generic framework for automated negotiation. It describes, in detail, the components of the framework, assesses the sophistication of the majority of work in the AI literature on these components, and discusses a number of prominent models of negotiation. This paper also highlights some of the major challenges for future automated negotiation research. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Nowadays, the business environment is characterized by great uncertainty and variability. In this environment, information technology (IT) has proved to be an important strategic ingredient for the creation of competitive advantage. This role of IT has been widely accepted during the past few years [Feeny D. Creating and sustaining competitive advantage with IT. In: Earl M, editor. Information management the strategic direction. Oxford, 1990; Ives B. Wingtip Courriers, Southern Methodist University Case Study #SMY/MIS/90-01, Edwin L. Cox School of Business, Dallas, TX, January 1990]. In the new era of production, strategic priorities rather than a cost contained focus have proved to be important for competition, namely: quality, dependability, flexibility, customer service, after sale service, supply chain management, etc. IT proved to be vital for successful competition as it can facilitate the attainment of these strategic targets. In this paper, the impact of IT on financial performance for the different types and levels of business strategy is examined. After the clustering of firms according to their strategic priorities, the effect of IT on financial performance is estimated. To do this a cross-sectional study was held in the field of Greek manufacturing firms that apply advanced IT, in order to explore which, how and in what level manufacturing priorities have been adopted. For that purpose, cluster analysis and VACOR algorithm were used, to distinguish clusters of firms and estimate the effect of IT on financial performance, for each type and level of strategic choice. Return on invested capital (ROIC) has been used as a criterion of performance in order to incorporate the effect of cost, revenues and profits. It was found that the effect of IT on financial performance was observed to be greater for firms which emphasize the higher level of flexibility strategy and the middle level of cost strategy. On the contrary, the effect of IT on performance was observed to be greater for firms which emphasize a lower level of quality and innovation strategy. Further discussion of these results and conclusions were drawn. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose - This paper aims to develop a genetic algorithm (GA)-based process knowledge integration system (GA-PKIS) for generalizing a set of nearly optimal fuzzy rules in quality enhancement based on the extracted fuzzy association rules in a supply chain network. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed methodology provides all levels of employees with the ability to formulate nearly optimal sets of fuzzy rules to identify possible solutions for eliminating the number of defect items. Findings - The application of the proposed methodology in the slider manufacturer has been studied. After performing the spatial analysis, the results obtained indicate that it is capable of ensuring the finished products with promising quality. Research limitations/implications - In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, only some processes within the supply chain are chosen. Future studies can advance this research by applying the proposed approach in different industries and processes. Originality/value - Because of the complexity of the logistics operations along the supply chain, the traditional quality improvement approaches cannot address all the quality problems automatically and effectively. This newly developed GA-based approach can help to optimize the process parameters along the supply chain network. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Constructed on clustering supply chain information technology and organizational structure variables, six archetypes are identified: (1) Simple, Low Performers; (2) Market Performers; (3) Average Players: Large and Old; (4) Internally Integrated Low Performers; (5) Masters of Efficiency: Technocratic, Complex, and Decentralized; and (6) Two-time Winners. The archetypes differ in terms of performance not only because of their unique supply chain information technology and organizational structure attributes, but also because of how the selected set of attributes "fits" the context of the firm. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={We present the application of data mining and analytics to support medical material management. Medical materials considered include medical equipment, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and blood. This paper presents the work performed in two different Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) funded projects -(i) Medical Material Knowledge Discoverer (MMKD), covering medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and item management; and (ii) Blood Reserve Availability Assessment, Tracking, and Management System (BRAMS), covering blood supply chain management. Data mining and analytics are used to analyze inventory and consumption patterns, evaluate supply chain status, identify and determine key performance metrics at different levels of hierarchy, detect potential problems and issues and identify opportunities for improvement. The paper presents the application of clustering, association rules, regression analyses, online analytical processing (OLAP), performance metrics, data validation, alerts and notifications, a Geographic Information System (GIS), and analyses at multiple levels of abstraction to facilitate the efficient management of supply chains. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, the paper does not present data mining results per se, and data and analyses results are obscured when necessary. Instead, the focus of the paper is on how data mining and analytics are used to support supply chain management.},

abstract={Future market conditions can be a pivotal factor in making business decisions. We present and evaluate methods used by our agent, Deep Maize, to forecast market prices in the Trading Agent Competition Supply Chain Management Game. As a guiding principle we seek to exploit as many sources of available information as possible to inform predictions. Since information comes in several different forms, we integrate well-known methods in a novel way to make predictions. The core of our predictor is a nearest-neighbors machine learning algorithm that identifies historical instances with similar economic indicators. We augment this with an online learning procedure that transforms the predictions by optimizing a scoring rule. This allows us to select more relevant historical contexts using additional information available during individual games. We also explore the advantages of two different representations for predicting price distributions. One uses absolute prices, and the other uses statistics of price time series to exploit local stability. We evaluate these methods using both data from the 2005 tournament final round and additional simulations. We compare several variations of our predictor to one another and a baseline predictor similar to those used by many other tournament agents. We show substantial improvements over the baseline predictor, and demonstrate that each element of our predictor contributes to improved performance. © 2007 IFAAMAS.},

abstract={The TAC Supply Chain Management (TAC/SCM) game presents a challenging dynamic environment for autonomous decision-making in a salient application domain. Strategic interactions complicate the analysis of games such as TAC/SCM. since the effectiveness of a given strategy depends on the strategies played by other agents on the supply chain. The TAC tournament generates results from one particular path of combinations, and success in the tournament is rightly regarded as evidence for agent quality. Such results along with post-competition controlled experiments provide useful evaluations of novel techniques employed in the game. We argue that a broader game-theoretic analysis framework can provide a firmer foundation for choice of experimental contexts. Exploiting a repository of agents from the 2005 and 2006 TAC/SCM tournaments, we demonstrate an empirical game-theoretic methodology based on extensive simulation and careful measurement. Our analysis of agents from TAC-05 reveals interesting interactions not seen in the tournament. Extending the analysis to TAC-06 enables us to measure progress from year-to-year, and generates a candidate empirical equilibrium among the best known strategies. We use this equilibrium as a stable background population for comparing relative performance of the 2006 agents, yielding insights complementing the tournament results. © 2007 IFAAMAS.},

abstract={Mixed Multi-Unit Combinatorial Auctions (MMUCAs) allow agents to bid for bundles of goods to buy, goods to sell, and transformations of goods. In particular, MMUCAs offer a high potential to be employed for the automated assembly of supply chains of agents offering goods and services, and in general MMUCAs extend and generalise several types of combinatorial auctions. Here we provide a formalism, based on an extension of Petri Nets, with which MMUCAs, and therefore all auction types subsumed by MMUCAs - - and in particular combinatorial auctions for supply chain formation (SCF) - -, can be formally analysed. As a second direct benefit, consequence of the provided mapping to Petri Nets, we manage to dramatically reduce the number of decision variables involved in the optimisation problem posed by MMUCAs from quadratic to linear for a wide class of MMUCA Winner Determination Problems (WDPs). Hence, we also make headway in the practical application of MMUCAs, and in particular to SCF. © 2007 IFAAMAS.},

abstract={The cram of supply chain management (SCM) is being considered as center of attention and motivation, not only among academics but also among practitioners in recent years. SCM systems face complexity, process's time compression, and lack ness of process optimization. In our current work, we present a broad framework for SCM, based on K-means clustering algorithm which concentrates on the supply chain (SC) processes for lessen the complexity, optimization factors in SC process communication, product variability and inaccurate forecast. Results show a feasibility to adopt this technique from a business analyst view point. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a novel domain-concept association rules (DCAR) mining algorithm that offers solutions to complex cell formation problems, which consist of a non-binary machine-component (MC) matrix and production factors for fast and accurate decision support. Design-methodology-approach The DCAR algorithm first identifies the domain-concept from the demand history and then performs association rule mining to find associations among machines. After that, the algorithm forms machine-cells with a series of inclusion and exclusion processes to minimize inter-cell material movement and intra-cell void element costs as well as to maximize the grouping efficacy with the constraints of bill of material (BOM) and the maximum number of machines allowed for each cell. Findings The DCAR algorithm delivers either comparable or better results than the existing approaches using known binary datasets. The paper demonstrates that the DCAR can obtain satisfying machine-cells with production costs when extra parameters are needed. Research limitations-implications The DCAR algorithm adapts the idea of the sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) to iteratively evaluate and arrange machine-cells until the result is stabilized. The SFFS is an improvement over a greedy version of the algorithm, but can only ensure sub-optimal solutions. Practical implications – The DCAR algorithm considers a wide range of production parameters, which make the algorithm suitable to the real-world manufacturing system settings. Originality-value The proposed DCAR algorithm is unlike other array-based algorithms. It can group non-binary MC matrix with considerations of real-world factors including product demand, BOM, costs, and maximum number of machines allowed for each cell. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate logistics activities in Singapore hospitals. It defines various types of activities handled by a logistics division. Inventory management policy and the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for logistics purposes are also discussed. The study identifies the nature of strategic alliances in Singapore's health care industry. Design/methodology/approach This study was conducted by utilizing a framework for data collection, pre-testing the questionnaire and conducting interviews. Various relevant literature was reviewed to design the questionnaire. Findings This study finds that logistics division carry out many related activities and some of them also provide engineering services. The hospitals make use of ICT. The hospitals are clustered under various groups to minimize the cost of operation, including the logistics related costs. However, hospitals do not see alliances with suppliers as a strategic option; rather they focus on outsourcing of logistics services. The findings also show that Singapore hospitals have a good stocking policy for both medical and non-medical items so that changes in patient mix can be easily handled. Originality/value Singapore is continuously improving its health care industry and therefore, the findings will help hospitals in other regions to adopt some of the practices, like concentrating on local vendors, outsourcing, clustering, and maximum use of information technology as competitive factors that can improve the service and reduce the cost of operation. The paper suggests motivators and barriers to the use of ICT in logistics in the health care industry. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Purpose - This paper aims to propose a logistical network design framework with robustness and complexity considerations. Design/methodology/approach - The paper defines robustness, complexity, and normalised efficiency of a logistical network. A mathematical model is then constructed based on the conceptual framework and applied to a hypothetical case study with varying robustness requirements. The mathematical model is formulated as an Mixed-Integer Linear Programming problem. Furthermore, the paper introduces a graph-theoretic view of the logistical network and presents its topological properties such as average path length, clustering coefficient, and degree distribution. Findings - The results show that logistical network configurations can be obtained with desirable robustness levels whilst minimising cost. The relationships of robustness versus normalised efficiency and complexity are also presented. The results show that relationships between logistical network topological properties and robustness exist, as in other real world natural and man-made complex networks. Practical implications - Logistical network design is one of the earliest strategic decisions in supply chain management that supply chain managers have to make. Practitioners and researchers typically focus on optimising efficiency and/or responsiveness of logistical networks. It is argued that logistical network designers should also consider robustness and complexity as they are important characteristics of logistical network functionality. The logistical network design frame work successfully incorporates robustness and complexity into design considerations. Originality/value - This paper newly introduces other important performance measures, robustness and complexity, into the logistical network design objective. The design framework is highly relevant and adds value to logistical network designers and managers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Owing to ill-structured, dynamic environments and the presence of multiple decision-makers with conflicting viewpoints, comprehension, analysis and support of the supplier evaluation process becomes more and more difficult. Moreover, with the complexities of issues such as the role of leadership, the influence of group formation, and analysis of disagreements, it cannot be predictable that there will ever exist a solution to cope with all imprecise, multi-criteria/multi-actor situations. A fuzzy association rules-based approach may be suited for the judgement of human subjects. In this paper, we develop an approach based on Fuzzy Association Rule Mining to support the decision makers by enhancing the flexibility in making decisions for evaluating suppliers with both tangibles and intangibles attributes. Also, by checking the fuzzy classification rules, the goal of knowledge acquisition can be achieved in a framework in which assessments could be established without constraints, and consequently checked and compared in several details. The efficacy and intricacy of the proposed model for finding fuzzy association rules from the database for supplier assessment is demonstrated with the help of numerical examples.},

abstract={Purpose The integration of e-business and supply chain enables seamless information flow from suppliers to customer service network via the internet. It also enables better-coordinated materials flow from customer order to production, storage, distribution and delivery. The purpose of this paper is to describe the work that leads to the realisation of a hierarchical model for e-supply chain coordination and optimisation. Design/methodology/approach The model is based on an e-business information flow network in order to respond rapidly to the dynamics of e-supply chain and market. It can be used to realize management level strategies, and facilitate the planning and control of detailed operation schedules of supply chain units in an e-supply chain environment. Three main modules are discussed. They are routing and sequence optimiser (RSO) with the aid of a GA and TS-based multiple population search strategy (MPSS): supply chain virtual clustering (SCVC) based on fuzzy virtual clustering: and supply chain order scheduling (SCOS) using an agent-based distributed scheduling system. Findings These modules enable: the generation of preferred routings, transportation modes and work order plan under such constraints as customer service level, cycle time and cost: the formation of supply chain's unit-transportation-work order families using a clustering approach to down-size supply chain problems and increase computation efficiency: and the integration of scheduling with supply chain optimisation in order to facilitate the control of a supply chain with the aid of an agent-based distributed scheduling approach. Originality/value This paper proposed a hierarchical model for e-supply chain coordination and optimisation that is capable to solve large-scale problems. A MPSS using GA and TS was depicted in detail to expedite the RSO. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={Drinking water supply companies monitor the presence of Escherichia coli in drinking water to verify the effectiveness of measures that prevent faecal contamination of drinking water. Data are lacking, however, on the sensitivity of the monitoring programmes, as designed under the EU Drinking Water Directive. In this study, the sensitivity of such a monitoring programme was evaluated by hydraulic model simulations of contamination events and calculations of the detection probability of the actual sampling programme of 2002. In the hydraulic model simulations of 16-h periods of 1 l h-1 ingress of untreated domestic sewage, the spread of the contamination through the network and the E. coli concentration dynamics were calculated. The results show that when large parts of the sewage reach reservoirs, e.g. when they originate from the treatment plant or a trunk main, mean detection probabilities are 55-65%. When the contamination does not reach any of the reservoirs, however, the detection probability varies from 0% (when no sampling site is reached) to 13% (when multiple sites are reached). Mean detection probabilities of nine simulated ingress incidents in mains are 5.5% with an SD of 6.5%. In reality, these detection probabilities are probably lower as the study assumed no inactivation or clustering of E. coli, 100% recovery efficiency of the E. coli detection methods and immediate mixing of contaminations in mains and reservoirs. The described method provides a starting point for automated evaluations and optimisations of sampling programmes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Scale determining of the merchant logistics centers can be studied under the discussion of the game of the suppliers, logistics centers proprietors and consumers by fuzzy c-means clustering. Using complex adaptive system theory we analyzed the game relation among the suppliers, the merchant logistics centers and the consumers. To consumers random sample was used combined with population distribution and district partition of our research city. By fuzzy c-means clustering analysis the families of the city can be assigned to different groups according to the eigenvectors such as the family income, consumption payout. The uncertain game model with three-level was established. Particle swarm optimization with multi-level programming was adopted in the concrete algorithm course for solution. The concrete results are better than the results without fuzzy clustering analysis and show that the thought and the methods are correctness and feasibility. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Finding frequent patterns from databases has been the most time consuming process in data mining tasks, like association rule mining. Frequent pattern mining in real-time is of increasing thrust in many business applications such as e-commerce, recommender systems, and supply-chain management and group decision support systems, to name a few. A plethora of efficient algorithms have been proposed till date, among which, vertical mining algorithms have been found to be very effective, usually outperforming the horizontal ones. However, with dense datasets, the performances of these algorithms significantly degrade. Moreover, these algorithms are not suited to respond to the real-time need. In this paper, we describe BDFS(b)-diff-sets, an algorithm to perform real-time frequent pattern mining using diff-sets and limited computing resources. Empirical evaluations show that our algorithm can make a fair estimation of the probable frequent patterns and reaches some of the longest frequent patterns much faster than the existing algorithms. © 2006 IEEE.},

From California to Florida to New Jersey, neighborhoods are passing ordinances that dictate the sizes and even architectural styles of new shops. Building more of the same-long the cornerstone of retailer growth-seems to be tapped out as a strategy. Of course, a company can't customize every element of its business in every location. Strategists have begun to use clustering techniques to simplify and smooth out decision making and to focus their efforts on the relatively small number of variables that usually drive the bulk of consumer purchases. The customization-by-clusters approach, which began as a strategy for grocery stores in 1995, has since proven effective in drugstores, department stores, mass merchants, big-box retailers, restaurants, apparel companies, and a variety of consumer goods manufacturers. Clustering sorts things into groups, so that the associations are strong between members of the same cluster and weak between members of different clusters. In fact, by centiahzing data-intensive and scale-sensitive functions (such as store design, merchandise assortment, buying, and supply chain management), localization libetates store personnel to do what they do best: Test innovative solutions to local challenges and forge strong bonds with communities. Ultimately, all companies serving con suiners will fate the challenge of local customization. We are advancing to a world where the strategies of the most successful businesses will be as diverse as the com munities they serve.},

We show that market conditions can be characterized by distinguishable statistical patterns that can be learned from historic data and used, together with real-time observable information, to identify the current market regime and to forecast market changes. We use a Gaussian Mixture Model to represent the probabilities of market prices and, by clustering these probabilities, we identify different economic regimes. We show that the regimes so identified have properties that correlate with market factors that are not directly observable. We then present methods to predict regime changes. We validate our methods by presenting experimental results obtained with data from the Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract={Association rule mining in real-time is of increasing thrust in many business applications. Applications such as e-commerce, recommender systems, supply-chain management and group decision support systems are to name a few. Finding frequent patterns from databases has been the most time consuming process of the association rule mining. Till date, a large number of algorithms have been proposed in the area of frequent pattern generation. However, all of these algorithms produce output only at the completion and are not amenable to the real-time need. The need for real-time frequent pattern mining for online tasks and real-time decision-making is increasingly being felt. In this paper, we describe BDFS(b), an algorithm to perform real-time frequent pattern mining using limited computer memory. Empirical evaluations show that our algorithm can make a fair estimation of the probable frequent patterns and reaches some of the longest frequent patterns much faster than the existing algorithms.},

abstract={Research on warehousing systems has gained interest since the 1980s, reflecting the fact that supply chain management has pursued a demand-driven organization with high product variety, small order sizes, and reliable short response times throughout the supply chain. This market trend has affected warehouse management and operations tremendously. Order batching in a warehouse attempts to achieve high-volume order processing operations by consolidating small orders into batches. Order batching is an essential operation of order processing in which several orders are grouped into batches. This paper describes the development of an order batching approach based on data mining and integer programming. It is valuable to discover the important associations between orders such that the occurrence of some orders in a batch will cause the occurrence of other orders in the same batch. An order-clustering model based on 0-1 integer programming can be formulated to maximize the associations between orders within each batch. From the results of several test problems, the proposed approach shows its ability to find quality solutions of order batching problems. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper considers the problem of constructing order batches for distribution centers using a data mining technique. With the advent of supply chain management, distribution centers fulfill a strategic role of achieving the logistics objectives of shorter cycle times, lower inventories, lower costs and better customer service. Many companies consider both their cost effectiveness and market proficiency to depend primarily on efficient logistics management. Warehouse management system (WMS) presently is considered a key to strengthening company logistics. Order picking is routine in distribution centers. Before picking a large set of orders, effectively grouping orders into batches can accelerate product movement within the storage zone. The order batching procedure has to be implemented in WMS and may be run online many times daily. The literature has proposed numerous batching heuristics for minimizing travel distance or travel time. This paper presents a clustering procedure for an order batching problem in a distribution center with a parallel-aisle layout. A data mining technique of association rule mining is adopted to develop the order clustering approach. Performance comparisons between the developed approach and existing heuristics are given for various problems. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Supply Chain Management is a concept that assumes a business as a chain of inter-connected entities of commercial activities [24]. Therefore, the objective of Supply Chain Management is reducing inventory, lead times and cost at each link under the given constraints. In this paper, we propose a cooperation model for Supply Chain Management using Multi-Agent System. This model constructs a relevant supply chain through iterated matchmaking process. The matchmaking process makes connection between service provider and service requestor for each link of the supply chain [23]. The effective supply chain can be made when each link of the supply chain is connected properly. In order to make a proper connection for each link, this proposed model uses multi-agent system as foundation architecture and uses clustering, rule-based system and neural networks as matching method. With this model, we can make optimum chain connection from the procurement to the customer. © 2004 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This study deals with solving uncapacitated location-allocation (LA) problems with rectilinear distances by using a method based on Kohonen self-organizing feature maps (SOFMs). By treating LA problems as clustering problems, this method has the advantage of extracting the structure of the input data by a self-organizing process based on adaptation rules. In this paper, a heuristic method is constructed by using SOFMs with a guided refining procedure, and its performance is compared with simulated annealing. The experimental results using the proposed guided refining procedure to reinforce the SOFM method show that the proposed method is excellent in terms of quality of solution and speed of computation. In addition, the experimental results suggest that SOFMs may provide an excellent approach when generating initial solutions for other heuristic or exact algorithms. This conjecture is made because most of the solutions yielded by SOFM are close to the optimal solution in all experiments. Scope and purpose Given the location of a set of customers with different demands, the LA problem is to select the locations of a number of supply centers to serve the customers and to decide the corresponding allocation of the customers to supply centers under a given optimization criterion. The LA problem may arise in fire stations, hospitals, police stations, telecommunication networks, and warehouses relative to production facilities and customers. In addition, the recent rapid growth of demand for supply chain management, which can decrease the total cost, while improving the quality of goods and services of various organizations, has drawn significant research attention. As an important part of supply chain management, the LA problem is related to the facility management service, logistics and distribution, order entry and customer service operations. Therefore, it should be indicated much more than before for organizations to improve their competitive advantage. In solving the LA problem, the costs of transportation between customers and supply centers are proportional to an appropriately determined distance, e.g. the Euclidean distance or rectilinear distance. The location of supply centers and the allocation of customers to supply centers must be considered simultaneously. The capacities of supply centers in LA problems can either be fixed or treated without any limitation if the capacity of each supply center can be adjusted according to the amount of allocated service demands of customers, which are referred to as capacitated and uncapacitated problems, respectively. In addition, the assumption of no interaction between supply centers makes LA problems different from p-hub problems. Currently, existing algorithms for solving the LA problems cannot meet the demands of rapidly changing industrial or market environments, since they are either time consuming or provide poor-quality solutions. Therefore, in this article, we propose a heuristic method using Kohonen's feature maps, which are artificial neural networks capable of mapping the distribution of input data to specified neurons, with a guided refining procedure to solve uncapacitated LA problems. In addition, the investigation of appropriateness of using Kohonen's feature maps (called SOFMs) as an initial solution-generating method for another heuristic or exact method is also provided. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Individuals in organizations often need to access knowledge that is outside their own area of expertise. Doing so requires "know-who" knowledge-knowledge of who knows what inside (or outside) the organization. This paper develops the concept of a knowledge directory, a database that can be searched via query. The knowledge directory returns a list of individuals rank ordered by the mutual affinity between their own areas of expertise and the content of the query. The technology behind the matching of person and query is centering resonance analysis, which develops a knowledge map, representing objects embedded in text as a network graph. We also present a way to analyze a collection of knowledge maps so that clusters of people who have similar expertise may be identified. We apply these techniques to a group of ten university faculty from the areas of industrial engineering, operations management, and supply chain management. Experiments attempting to match queries to specific faculty members are presented and discussed, and clustering techniques are used to show how the faculty aggregate into cliques of similar content and methodological expertise. Extensions of the method are discussed.},

abstract={Using a sample of 29 virtual clusters, the paper examines new sources of clustering in the digital economy. The “virtual cluster” phenomenon highlights the most significant effect of the development of the information and communication technologies in the business environment. A virtual cluster is conceived as an e-business community, made up of customers, suppliers, distributors and commerce providers sharing digital and knowledge networks for collaboration and competition. The purpose of this paper is to set out the characteristics of a new competitive space, in which a strategic role is played by virtual processes among partners, and to review the traditional sources of clustering in the digital economy environment (Romano et al., 1999). More specifically, this paper attempts to show the emerging overlap between digital and knowledge networks, which generates a new competitive space within a new global-virtual learning environment. Finally, assuming that traditional sources of clustering are generally identified in specialisation (based on a sophisticated division of labour) and geographic proximity, the paper discusses how the role of organisational proximity acts as a substitute for geographic proximity in supporting coordination and tacit knowledge exchange. As it emerges from the analysis of our cases, from a managerial point of view, organisational proximity may be achieved through the implementation of supply chain management (SCM) and customer relationship management (CRM) strategies. An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 23rd Institute of Small Business Affairs Annual Resource and Policy Conference in November 1999 in Leeds, UK. © 2001, MCB UP Limited},
