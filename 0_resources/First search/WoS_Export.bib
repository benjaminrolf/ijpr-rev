Abstract = {Association rule is a widely used data mining technique that searches
   through an entire data set for rules revealing the nature and frequency
   of relationships or associations between data entities. Supplier
   selection is a significant work in supply chain management. Often, there
   will be thousands of potential suppliers and identifying a subset of
   these suppliers can be a complex process of determining a satisfactory
   subset based on a number of factors. In this paper, the Supplier
   selection can be viewed as the problem of mining a large database of
   shipment. The proposed method incorporates the extended association rule
   algorithm of data mining with that of set theory to find key suppliers.
   This research has employed a numerical example for the integrated method
   to develop suitable supplier clusters. The results Show that the method
   is effective and applicable. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Forecasting and Anomaly Detection approaches using LSTM and LSTM
   Autoencoder techniques with the applications in supply chain management},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {57},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Making appropriate decisions is indeed a key factor to help companies
   facing challenges from supply chains nowadays. In this paper, we propose
   two data-driven approaches that allow making better decisions in supply
   chain management. In particular, we suggest a Long Short Term Memory
   (LSTM) network-based method for forecasting multivariate time series
   data and an LSTM Autoencoder network-based method combined with a
   one-class support vector machine algorithm for detecting anomalies in
   sales. Unlike other approaches, we recommend combining external and
   internal company data sources for the purpose of enhancing the
   performance of forecasting algorithms using multivariate LSTM with the
   optimal hyperparameters. In addition, we also propose a method to
   optimize hyperparameters for hybrid algorithms for detecting anomalies
   in time series data. The proposed approaches will be applied to both
   benchmarking datasets and real data in fashion retail. The obtained
   results show that the LSTM Autoencoder based method leads to better
   performance for anomaly detection compared to the LSTM based method
   suggested in a previous study. The proposed forecasting method for
   multivariate time series data also performs better than some other
   methods based on a dataset provided by NASA.},

Abstract = {Today's business environment, survival and making profit in market are
   the prime requirement for any enterprise due to competitive environment.
   Innovation and staying updated are commonly identified two key
   parameters for achieving success and profit in business. Considerably
   supply chain management is also accountable for profit. As a measure to
   maximize the profit, supply chain process is to be streamlined and
   optimized. Appropriate grouping of various suppliers for the benefit of
   shipment cost reduction is proposed. Data relating to appropriate
   attributes of supplier logistics are collected. A methodology is
   proposed to optimize the supplier logistics using clustering algorithm.
   In the proposed methodology data preprocessing, clustering and
   validation process have been carried out. The Z-score normalization is
   used to normalize the data, which converts the data to uniform scales
   for improving the clustering performance. By employing Hierarchical and
   K-means clustering algorithms the supplier logistics are grouped and
   performance of each method is evaluated and presented. The supplier
   logistics data from different country is experimented. Outcome of this
   work can help the buyers to select the cost effective supplier for their

Journal = {RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE},

Volume = {62},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) launched by the Bank of England
   could enable businesses to directly make electronic payments. It can be
   argued that digital payment is helpful in supply chain management
   applications. However, the adoption of CBDC in the supply chain could
   bring new turbulence since the CBDC value may fluctuate. Therefore, this
   paper intends to optimize the production plan of manufacturing supply
   chain based on a volatility clustering model by reducing CBDC value
   uncertainty. We apply both GARCH model and machine learning model to
   depict the CBDC volatility clustering. Empirically, we employed Baltic
   Dry Index, Bitcoin and exchange rate as main variables with sample
   period from 2015 to 2021 to evaluate the performance of the two models.
   On this basis, we reveal that our machine learning model overwhelmingly
   outperforms the GARCH model. Consequently, our result implies that
   manufacturing companies' performance can be strengthened through CBDC
   uncertainty reduction.},

Title = {Distinguishing Organisational Profiles of Food Loss Management in
   Logistics},
Journal = {LOGISTICS-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Food loss management (FLM), which is discussed at length in
   the literature, lacks a scientific basis on which to determine the
   current engagement of actors in the food value chain and what is
   relevant to derive appropriate measures according to the circumstances
   in the organisations concerned. Therefore, this paper aims to derive
   patterns by which the engagement of actors can be distinguished and, on
   this basis, to make recommendations for further action. Methods: Based
   on an online survey of 40 participants, a clustering analysis was
   conducted using the unsupervised learning method and hierarchical
   clustering (R and R Studio). Results: Five clusters representing
   different profiles were derived, showing how actors in the food value
   chain have addressed FLM in the past. The derived profiles do not
   represent stages of development but rather characteristics of
   organisations that have addressed FLM in a certain way in the past.
   Conclusions: For the five organisational profiles, recommendations for
   action were given for further engagement with FLM. As the level of
   engagement with FLM increases, organisations should tackle increasingly
   complex measures to reduce food losses. At the same time, a shift in
   measures from the tactical to the strategic planning level was derived.},

   we propose a cooperation model for Supply Chain Management using
   Multi-Agent System. This model constructs a relevant supply chain
   through iterated matchmaking process. The matchmaking process makes
   connection between service provider and service requestor for each link
   of the supply chain {[}23]. The effective supply chain can be made when
   each link of the supply chain is connected properly. In order to make a
   proper connection for each link, this proposed model uses multi-agent
   system as foundation architecture and uses clustering, rule-based system
   and neural networks as matching method. With this model, we can make
   optimum chain connection from the procurement to the customer.},

Abstract = {Recommender system is a computer-based intelligent technique which
   facilitates the customers to fulfill their purchase requirements. In
   addition to this, it also helps retailers to manage the supply chain of
   their business and to develop different business strategies keeping in
   pace with the current market. Supply chain management (SCM) involves the
   streamlining of a business's supply-side activities to remain
   competitive in the business landscape. Maximizing the customer value is
   another important activity of SCM to gain an advantage in the market. In
   this work, theK-Means clustering algorithm has been used for the
   effective segmentation of customers who have bought apparel items. PCA
   has been used for dimensionality reduction of different features of
   products and customers. The main focus of this work is to determine the
   different possible associations of customers in terms of brand, product,
   and price from their purchase habits. The result shows that the clusters
   made by the algorithm based on PCA andK-Means are similar and the
   results are acceptable on the basis of feedback received from existing
   customers and satisfies the customers' requirements based on the amount
   of money (price range) the customers want to spend while doing online
   shopping. The features of products purchased by customers were combined
   together to generate a unique product key for business, and a model was
   prepared to segment products based on the volume of products sold and
   revenue generated, and the price of products sold and revenue generated.
   This work, in the long run, will help business houses to build a
   sustainable, profitable, and scalable e-commerce business.

Abstract = {Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the supply chain has become an
   increasingly popular research topic, but there are little researches on
   developing countries or emerging market economies as the research
   object, let alone providing a framework for assessing CSR in sustainable
   supply chains in the context of these countries. This paper will make up
   for these literature gaps. From the perspective of the green supply
   chain management, this paper integrates various authoritative standards
   and adopts two methods, ``R clustering{''} and ``variation coefficient
   analysis{''}, to establish a CSR performance evaluation system of
   China's transportation industry. Applying the mean square error index
   weighting method analyzes the performance of 74 companies in China's
   transportation industry in 2018 to verify the rationality of the
   evaluation system. The results find that this industry generally scores
   low and the performance of responsibilities of different sub-sectors in
   this industry is different, but the overall performance trend is
   improving. This research has implications for China's transportation
   industry to improve CSR levels from the perspective of green supply

   improving China's CSR green and sustainable development, and for the

Abstract = {Research on warehousing systems has gained interest since the 1980s,
   reflecting the fact that supply chain management has pursued a
   demand-driven organization with high product variety, small order sizes,
   and reliable short response times throughout the Supply chain. This
   market trend has affected warehouse management and operations
   tremendously. Order hatching in a warehouse attempts to achieve
   high-volume order processing operations by consolidating small orders
   into batches. Order batchine is an essential operation of order
   processing in which several orders are grouped into batches. This paper
   describes the development of an order hatching approach based on data
   mining and integer programming. It is valuable to discover the important
   associations between orders such that the occurrence of some orders in a
   batch will cause the occurrence of other orders in the same batch. An
   order-clustering model based on 0-1 integer programming can be
   formulated to maximize the associations between orders within each
   batch. From the results of several test problems, the proposed approach
   shows its ability to find quality solutions of order batching problems.

Abstract = {Despite the long-recognised importance of data-driven operations and
   supply chain management (OSCM) scholarship and practice, and the
   impressive development of big data analytics (BDA), research finds that

   in the literature. Therefore, we conduct this systematic literature
   review of journal articles on data-driven OSCM from 2000 to early 2020
   to ascertain established research clusters and literature lacunae. Using
   co-citation analysis software and double-checking the results with
   factor analysis and multidimensional-scaling-based k-means clustering,
   we find six clusters of studies on data-driven OSCM, whose primary
   topics are identified by keyword co-occurrence analysis. Five of these
   clusters relate directly to manufacturing, which, in line with the
   existing literature, indicates the crucial role of production in OSCM.
   We highlight the evolution of these research clusters and propose how
   the literature on data-driven OSCM can support BDA in OSCM. We
   synthesise what has been studied in the literature as points of
   reference for practitioners and researchers and identify what
   necessitates further exploration. In addition to the insights
   contributed to the literature, our study is amongst the first efforts to
   deploy multiple clustering techniques to undertake a rigorous

Abstract = {Global supply chains have a distinct geography that involves the
   dimensions of production, distribution and consumption. This geography,
   at the heart of many sourcing strategies, is often neglected by supply
   chain managers, or at least scholars investigating supply chain
   management. However, this essay underlines that this geography reveals
   patterns that depict well the organization and structure of outsourcing
   with distribution systems supporting the dichotomy between the geography
   of production and consumption. Significant segments of supply chain
   management exist solely to support this spatial divergence. Global
   processes are also reflected in regional structures and the case of
   third party logistics providers is investigated. Depending on the
   gateway and the type of supply chain being serviced, North American 3PLs
   display a clustering that is particularly prevalent around airport
   terminals and crossborder ports of entry. Such firms are highly flexible
   and changes in the locational behavior are likely to reflect changes in

Journal = {EURO JOURNAL ON TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {The routing of commodities is a tactical problem in supply chain
   management that aims to synchronise transportation services connecting a
   network of warehouses and consolidation locations. This paper considers
   the routing of commodities in a transportation network that is flexible
   in response to demand through changes to regional warehouse clustering
   and the designation of consolidation locations. Traditionally, warehouse
   clustering and consolidation locations are determined as part of
   strategic planning that is performed months to years in advance of
   operations-limiting the flexibility in transportation networks to
   respond to changes in demand. A mathematical programming-based
   algorithmic framework is proposed to integrate the strategic decisions
   of location planning with tactical decisions of vehicle routing and
   synchronisation. A multi-armed bandit problem is developed to explore
   warehouse clustering decisions and exploit those that lead to small
   transportation costs. An extensive computational study will show that
   the proposed algorithmic framework effectively integrates strategic and
   tactical planning decisions to reduce the overall transportation costs.},

Abstract = {We address the multicriterion optimization of utility plants with
   economic and environmental concerns. Rather than optimizing a single
   environmental metric, which was the traditional approach followed in the
   past, we focus on optimizing these systems considering simultaneously
   several environmental indicators based on life cycle assessment (LCA)
   principles. We combine a multiobjective optimization model with an
   MILP-based dimensionality reduction method that allows identifying key
   environmental metrics that exhibit the property that their optimization
   will very likely improve the system simultaneously in all of the
   remaining damage categories. This analysis reduces the complexity of the
   underlying multiobjective optimization problem from the viewpoints of
   generation and interpretation of the solutions. The capabilities of the
   proposed method are illustrated through a case study based on a real
   industrial scenario, in which we show that a small number of
   environmental indicators suffice to optimize the environmental
   performance of the plant.},

Abstract = {The last decades have seen a growing interest in construction management
   amongst scholars, particularly, in how to apply supply chain management
   (SCM) strategies to improve logistics efficiency and project

   In this work, we concurrently deploy the rigorous six-step SLR protocol
   together with co-citation analysis, factor analysis, multidimensional
   scaling-based fuzzy k-means clustering, and keyword extraction and
   co-occurrence analysis to ascertain and examine dusters of CLSCM
   application. The results show that there are six established research
   clusters in CLSCM, namely, logistics and SCM for prefabricated
   construction, construction procurement, construction supply chain
   integration, green construction SCM, reverse logistics in construction
   and onsite construction logistics. Amongst these clusters, construction
   supply chain integration plays the most integral role. Informed by this

Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {453-460},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of constructing order batches for
   distribution centers using a data mining technique. With the advent of
   supply chain management, distribution centers fulfill a strategic role
   of achieving the logistics objectives of shorter cycle times, lower
   inventories, lower costs and better customer service. Many companies
   consider both their cost effectiveness and market proficiency to depend
   primarily on efficient logistics management. Warehouse management system
   (WMS) presently is considered a key to strengthening company logistics.
   Order picking is routine in distribution centers. Before picking a large
   set of orders, effectively grouping orders into batches can accelerate
   product movement within the storage zone. The order batching procedure
   has to be implemented in WMS and may be run online many times daily. The
   literature has proposed numerous batching heuristics for minimizing
   travel distance or travel time. This paper presents a clustering
   procedure for an order batching problem in a distribution center with a
   parallel-aisle layout. A data mining technique of association rule
   mining is adopted to develop the order clustering approach. Performance
   comparisons between the developed approach and existing heuristics are
   given for Various problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT},
Journal = {LOGFORUM},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {123-136},
Abstract = {Background: This paper presents a bibliometric overview of research
   published application of social network analysis in supply chain
   management in recent decades. It may be useful for showing the most
   important problems in this area. With this aim, Citespace is used to
   analyse the literature on the application of social network analysis in
   supply chain management to clarify the development and research trend.
   Bibliometric analysis is the quantitative study of bibliographic
   material. It provides a general picture of a research field that can be
   classified by papers, authors, and journals. The main objective of this
   study is to investigate the knowledge domain about application social
   network analysis in the supply chain field and reveal the thematic
   patterns and topics of high interest to researchers to predict emerging
   trends in the literature.
   Methods: To investigate the growth of studies about the applicable
   social network in supply chain management, 647 articles were reviewed by
   CiteSpace software. These papers were collected from the Core Collection
   of Thomson Reuters and published in 16 journals in operations research
   and management science from 2004 to 2021. Document co-citation analysis,
   clustering analysis, and citation burst detection were conducted to
   investigate and examine the thematic patterns, emerging trends, and
   critical articles of the knowledge domain.
   Results: Social network approaches are increasingly popular in the
   supply chain. Four major clusters are discussed in detail, namely
   multi-objective optimization, sustainable supply chain, supply network,
   and circular economy. Three research trends of supply chain network
   design, structural characteristics, and supplier selection and
   evaluation were identified based on citation bursts analysis.
   Conclusions: The present study offers a new approach to visualizing
   relevant data to synthesize scientific research findings of the
   application of social network analysis in supply chain management.
   Additionally, directions for future research in this area are presented.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the integration of sustainability into supply chain management
   (SCM) is a key issue for ensuring corporate competitiveness in face of
   dynamic ecological and social environments. This paper reviews 185
   journal publications of the last 20 years that formalize issues related
   to sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in quantitative models. In
   a content analysis, modeling and SCM characteristics as well as
   sustainability and SSCM constructs are elaborated. The models are
   assessed numerically by counting frequencies of occurrence and by
   clustering the paper sample according to selected characteristics. The
   findings indicate that SSCM models predominantly focus on deterministic
   approaches and the integration of environmental aspects of
   sustainability while neglecting stochastic modeling techniques and the
   consideration of social factors. By now, comprehensive modeling
   approaches are most often employed on intra-organizational levels
   whereas broader application areas are assessed by less complex models.
   The integration of pressures and incentives of external stakeholders or
   the formalization of sustainable supplier management and sustainability
   risks are identified as future research perspectives. Furthermore, the
   interrelationships between the triple bottom line dimensions are to be
   scrutinized in greater detail in order to avoid focused optimization of
   selected sustainability criteria. Seven modeling guidelines are derived
   from the reviewed literature to facilitate future model-based SSCM

Abstract = {Blockchain is one of the most anticipated technology revolutions, with
   immense promise in various applications. It is a distributed and
   encrypted database that can address a range of challenges connected to
   online security and trust. While many people identify Blockchain with
   cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, it has a wide range of applications in
   supply chain management, health, Internet of Things (IoT), education,
   identity theft prevention, logistics, and the execution of digital smart
   contracts. Although Blockchain Technology (BT) has numerous advantages
   for Decentralized Applications (DApps), it is nevertheless vulnerable to
   abuse, smart contract failures, security, theft, trespassing, and other
   concerns. As a result, using Machine Learning (ML) models to detect
   anomalies is an excellent way to detect and safeguard blockchain
   networks from criminal activity. Adapting ensemble learning methods in
   ML to create better prediction outcomes is a viable approach for anomaly
   identification. Ensemble learning, as the name implies, refers to
   creating a stronger and more accurate classification by combining the
   prediction results of numerous weak models. As a result, an in-depth
   evaluation of ensemble learning methodologies for anomaly detection in
   the blockchain network ecosystem is applied in this paper. It comprises
   numerous ensemble methods (e.g., averaging, voting, stacking, boosting,
   bagging). The review collects data from three established databases,
   which are Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and Google Scholar. Specific
   keywords are employed, such as Blockchain, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Anomaly
   Detection, and Ensemble Learning, employing advanced searching
   algorithms. The results of the search found 60 primary articles from
   2017 to 2022 (30 from Scopus, 20 from the WoS, and 10 from Google
   Scholar). Based on these findings, we decided to divide our debate into
   three primary themes: (1) the fundamentals of Blockchain Technology
   (BT), (2) the overview of ensemble learning, and (3) the integration and
   analysis of ensemble learning in blockchain networks for anomaly
   detection. In terms of awareness and knowledge, the results are also
   discussed in terms of what they mean and where future research should

Abstract = {Besides its effectiveness, supply chain management (SCM) is a complex
   process because of the stochastic and dynamic nature, multi-criterion
   and ever-increasing complexity of supply chains. Furthermore, companies
   have realized that agility is essential for their survival and
   competitiveness. Consequently, there is no generally accepted method by
   researchers and practitioners for designing, operating and evaluating
   agile supply chains. Moreover, the ability to build agile supply chain
   has developed more slowly than anticipated, because technology for
   managing agile supply chain is still being developed. Therefore, in this
   paper, we develop a new approach based oil Fuzzy Association Rule Mining
   to support the decision makers by enhancing the flexibility in making
   decisions for evaluating agility with both tangibles and intangibles
   attributes/criteria such as Flexibility, Profitability, Quality,
   Innovativeness, Pro-activity, Speed of response, Cost and Robustness.
   Also, by checking the fuzzy classification rules, the goal of knowledge
   acquisition can be achieved in a framework in which evaluation of
   agility could be established without constraints, and consequently
   checked and compared in several details. Efficacy and intricacy of the
   proposed approach for finding fuzzy association rules from the database
   for evaluating agility is demonstrated with the help of a numerical

Title = {Consumer preferences for sustainability and their impact on supply chain
   management The case of mobile phones},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION \& LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {43},
Number = {5-6, SI},
Pages = {380-406},
Abstract = {Purpose - Consumer values increasingly favor sustainable development in
   products and services, thereby fostering the need to develop new
   operational and managerial practices that support sustainability in
   supply chain management. The purpose of this study is to identify
   relevant product features related to sustainable development in this
   context, and use the choice of mobile phone as an example in measuring
   their importance.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study used two different methods
   (qualitative and quantitative) in two phases. First it organized
   focus-group discussions in order to identify the features of
   sustainability that affect the choice of a mobile phone. The most
   significant features served as a starting point for the choice of
   attributes to be included in the final step, choice-based conjoint
   analysis (CBC), which assesses respondents' value functions by means of
   latent class clustering. Between the two major phases it carried out two
   additional pre-tests in order to reduce the number of attributes.
   Findings - The results provide fundamental information concerning the
   relative importance of sustainability features in the selection of a
   mobile phone. The study identified four different clusters of
   purchasers: updaters, budgeters, environmentalists, and long-life users.
   According to the findings, some consumers are willing to pay a premium
   for sustainability features. The authors discuss the potential
   implications of the results in the context of supply chain design.
   Originality/value - The literature on supply chain management tends to
   see the consumers as a ``black box{''}. This paper reports the first
   results of opening this box by linking the supply chain perspective to
   consumer choice behavior.},

Abstract = {Owing to ill-structured, dynamic environments and the presence of
   multiple decision-makers with conflicting viewpoints, comprehension,
   analysis and support of the supplier evaluation process becomes more and
   more difficult. Moreover, with the complexities of issues such as the
   role of leadership, the influence of group formation, and analysis of
   disagreements, it cannot be predictable that there will ever exist a
   solution to cope with all imprecise, multi-criteria/multi-actor
   situations. A fuzzy association rules-based approach may be suited for
   the judgement of human subjects. In this paper, we develop an approach
   based on Fuzzy Association Rule Mining to support the decision makers by
   enhancing the flexibility in making decisions for evaluating suppliers
   with both tangibles and intangibles attributes. Also, by checking the
   fuzzy classification rules, the goal of knowledge acquisition can be
   achieved in a framework in which assessments could be established
   without constraints, and consequently checked and compared in several
   details. The efficacy and intricacy of the proposed model for finding
   fuzzy association rules from the database for supplier assessment is
   demonstrated with the help of numerical examples.},

Journal = {TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {135-149},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The continuously growing amount of available data has accelerated the
   emergence of numerous business intelligence applications that are
   summarized under the term Big Data Analytics (BDA). BDA is especially
   relevant to the domain of Supply Chain Management (SCM) as it provides
   the tools to support decision-making in increasingly global, volatile
   and dynamic value networks. However, its application challenges
   traditional institutional arrangements as well as roles that are related
   to the management of data. The underlying empirical study addresses this
   challenge with the application of a multi-method approach that is
   embedded in Organizational Information Processing Theory (OIPT). A
   Delphi survey was conducted to integrate expert assessments of
   projections up to the year 2035 and fuzzy c-means clustering was applied
   to identify future scenarios that span the future of BDA in SCM. The
   study suggests that BDA will improve demand forecasts, reduce safety
   stocks and improve the management of supplier performance. However,
   supply chain (SC) processes will become increasingly automated and
   traditional tasks of SCM will be partially substituted as a result.
   Consequently, the transition of the traditional role of SCM within
   organizations will increase the importance of human intuition, trust and
   strategic decision-making.},

Abstract = {Information systems (IS) impact supply chain management (SCM) on
   processes such as planning, sourcing, and delivering, and at levels
   ranging from tactical operations to organisational strategy. The vast

   literature analysis at the intersection of supply chain and information
   systems (SCIS), aiming to provide a classification for existing areas of
   research. This research is based on an analysis of more than 1500
   articles published in peer-reviewed journals over the past four decades
   to classify topics and methods and to identify major trends and
   distinguish important research themes. The classification of the
   literature has identified major clusters of research in SCIS, and
   suggestions are made for future research in each of the identified
   clusters. In general, the findings point out that there is a dearth of
   research on topics such as `impact of IT on vertical disintegration of
   supply chains,' `implications of new technologies for supply chains,'
   and `concerns related to trust, governance, ownership, privacy, and

Title = {Data-driven decision support system for managing item allocation in an
   ASRS: A framework development and a case study},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {185},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {When dealing with Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (ASRS), the
   allocation of items to the most convenient storage location depends on
   the vast amount of data produced internally (e.g., Enterprise Resource
   Planning, Manufacturing Enterprise Systems) and externally (e.g. Supply
   Chain Management). Moreover, a proper item allocation in the warehouse
   has a strong influence on the warehouse saturation levels and picking
   times. In this perspective, the present work proposes the application of
   data-driven algorithms for managing items in an Automated Storage and
   Retrieval System (ASRS) in order to reduce the picking times and storage
   space. Specifically, a four-layer framework is adopted for collecting
   data produced by different information sources and analyzing them
   through a data-driven approach. The analytics layer is performed by
   combining the Association Rule Mining (ARM) technique, to investigate
   the network of influences among data collected, and a simulation
   approach for assessing the feasibility of the proposed implementation.
   The Association Rule Mining allows company managers to identify the
   components that should be located on the same tray in the ASRS, defining
   the couples of items frequently picked together in order to reduce the
   total picking time. The proposed approach is applied to the case study
   of a shoe manufacturing company to explain the research approach and
   show how the implementation of the data-driven methodology can provide
   valuable support in defining item allocation and picking rules. The
   proposed Association Rule Mining method is new in this context and it
   has shown a positive impact in comparison to traditional solutions of
   warehouse management, providing a complete overview of the items'
   interactions and identifying communities of items that define local and
   global patterns and locate influential entities.},

Abstract = {Purpose Reverse logistics (RL), an inseparable aspect of supply chain
   management, returns used products to recovery processes with the aim of
   reducing waste generation. Enterprises, however, seem reluctant to apply
   RL due to various types of risks which are perceived as posing an
   economic threat to businesses. This paper draws on a synthesis of supply
   chain and risk management literature to identify and cluster RL risk
   factors and to recommend risk mitigation strategies for reducing the
   negative impact of risks on RL implementation.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors identify and cluster risk
   factors in RL by using risk management theory. Experts in RL and supply
   chain risk management validated the risk factors via a questionnaire. An
   unsupervised data mining method, self-organising map, is utilised to
   cluster RL risk factors into homogeneous categories. Findings A total of
   41 risk factors in the context of RL were identified and clustered into
   three different groups: strategic, tactical and operational. Risk
   mitigation strategies are recommended to mitigate the RL risk factors by
   drawing on supply chain risk management approaches. Originality/value

Abstract = {Multi-objective optimization (MOO) has recently attracted an increasing
   interest in environmental engineering. One major limitation of the
   existing solution methods for MOO is that their computational burden
   tends to grow rapidly in size with the number of environmental
   objectives. In this paper, we study the use of Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA) to identify redundant environmental metrics in MOO that
   can be omitted without disturbing the main features of the problem,
   thereby reducing the associated complexity. We show that, besides its
   numerical usefulness, the use of PCA coupled with MOO provides valuable
   insights on the relationships between environmental indicators of
   concern for decision-makers. The capabilities of the proposed approach
   are illustrated through its application to the design of environmentally
   conscious chemical supply chains (SCs). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Optimization Method for Anomaly Detection},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {The rapid development of emerging technologies such as machine learning
   and data mining promotes a lot of smart applications, e.g., Internet of
   things (IoT). The supply chain management and communication are a key
   research direction in the IoT environment, while the inventory
   management (IM) has increasingly become a core part of the whole life
   cycle management process of the supply chain. However, the current
   situations of a long supply chain life cycle, complex supply chain
   management, and frequently changing user demands all lead to a sharp
   rise in logistics and communication cost. Hence, as the core part of the
   supply chain, effective and predictable IM becomes particularly
   important. In this way, this work intends to reduce the cost during the
   life cycle of the supply chain by optimizing the IM process.
   Specifically, the IM process is firstly formulated as a mathematical
   model, in which the objective is to jointly minimize the logistic cost
   and maximize the profit. On this basis, a deep inventory management
   (DIM) method is proposed to address this model by using the long
   short-term memory (LSTM) theory of deep learning (DL). In particular,
   DIM transforms the time series problem into a supervised learning one
   and it is trained using the back propagation pattern, such that the
   training process can be finished efficiently. The experimental results
   show that the average inventory demand prediction accuracy of DIM
   exceeds about 80\%, which can reduce the inventory cost by about 25\%
   compared with the other state-of-the-art methods and detect the anomaly
   inventory actions quickly.},

Abstract = {Industry 4.0 technologies are causing a paradigm shift in supply chain
   process management. The digital transformation of the supply chains
   provides enormous benefits to organizations by empowering collaboration
   among multiple internal and external organizations and systems. This
   study presents a narrative review explaining the existing knowledge on
   digital transformation in supply chain process management using text
   mining. It summarizes the existing literature to explain the current
   state of the art in supply chain digitalization. This comprehensive
   review identifies the most important topics and technologies and
   determines the future trends in this emerging field. We investigate the
   articles published in Web of Science and Scopus databases and use text
   mining techniques (clustering and topic modeling) on the article
   contents. Using VOS viewer, a bibliometric analysis of 395 articles with
   12,700 references is analyzed. The contents of the articles are explored
   using text mining approaches. The synthesized results reveal that the
   most important topics in digital transformation are ``sustainable supply
   chain management{''} and ``circular economy and industry 4.0
   technologies{''}. The study further discovers big data, data analytics,
   blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet
   of Things as the most critical technologies for facilitating supply
   chain digital transformation. Finally, an overlay heatmap analysis of
   the research articles found that digital transformation, supply chain

   Design/methodology/approach Multi-method approach was employed as
   primary data were collected from a case study of Shaoxing textile
   cluster, and was supplemented with secondary data to triangulate the
   findings. The proposition that competitive advantages of industrial
   clusters facilitate effective SCM was explored.
   Findings The authors reveal that China's cost advantage is manifested in
   the entire value chain. The provision of business friendly amenities as
   a result of synergetic benefits of vertical and horizontal integration
   of supply clusters promotes competitiveness of SMEs and region as a
   whole. Moreover, specialized markets and international traders found to
   play significant role in sustainable cluster development.
   Research limitations/implications As with fieldwork and case studies,
   generalization should be drawn with care. Systematic synthesis of
   relevant case studies is recommended.
   Practical implications The study endorses the construction of local
   supply chains and suggests implementation of cluster strategy by
   focusing on environment-specific execution of triple helix model.
   Originality/value The article elaborates the linkages between cluster
   theory and SCM both within cluster and between interspersed clusters. It
   also explains how specialized markets and global players are enabling

   improvements on current food production and distribution systems
   capabilities, as well as to adapt these systems to expected trends such
   as climate change. Changing climate patterns may present opportunities
   for unidentified, geographical regions with adequate climate patterns to
   produce high-value agricultural products in a profitable and sustainable
   manner.
   This paper focuses on the design and planning aspects of a discovery
   process to unearth agri-food supply chains capable of generating
   attractive return on investments. A stochastic optimization framework is
   used to develop planting and harvesting schedules for a set of
   identified regions with complementary weather characteristics. To
   address the high-level of variability in the problem context, a
   two-stage stochastic decomposition method is used to consider a larger
   number of scenarios. As part of the solution process, a modeling scheme
   is developed that learns past interactions between entering discretized,
   weather scenarios and optimal first-stage solutions. In this context,
   machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques are used to
   iteratively estimate each region's probability of belonging to
   first-stage solutions based on previous solution-scenario results. The
   implementation of the stochastic framework is shown through a case study
   applied to multiple locations within the US southwest states of Arizona
   and New Mexico. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Supply chain management first needs to solve the location problem of
   distribution center of logistics. At present, the application of the
   centre-of-gravity method to calculate site selection is relative
   extensive. Based on the method of extreme distance calculation in the
   field of data mining technology, a new supply chain distribution center
   selection method combined with clustering algorithm and the
   centre-of-gravity selection method was proposed in this paper. In order
   to avoid the limitation of the traditional centre-of-gravity algorithm,
   the geographical location price was added to the optimization algorithm
   as the weight value, and the total cost of the model was calculated;
   then a ``three-segment{''} data mining clustering algorithm was given to
   improve the efficiency of clustering calculation and avoid isolation
   finally, the K-means algorithm, the optimized three-segment algorithm
   and the hierarchical clustering algorithm and so on were compared, and
   the simulation calculation was carried out. It can be found that the
   algorithm of clustering center of gravity of the extreme distance data
   mining can reduce the cost and is advantageous to solve the problem of
   the location of the supply chain logistics center of gravity location.},

   chain management: a multi-method approach},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {157},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Economies are transitioning from a linear to a circular model to address
   global issues such as resource extraction, environmental degradation and
   waste generation. Cross-Sector Collaboration (C-SC) is an effective
   means to use resources in a way that is mutually beneficial and
   integrates sustainable practices into the value chain. The zero-waste
   aspiration of companies can be achieved through Circular Supply Chain
   Management (CSCM). Existing literature supports research initiatives in
   CSCM, but how C-SC influences CSCM is still unexplored. Moreover, the
   barriers to C-SC for CSCM are untouched and the strategies to overcome
   these barriers are unmapped. This study fills this gap, assesses the
   barriers to C-SC for CSCM and suggests a strategic roadmap to overcome
   these barriers. The study was conducted in three different phases
   employing a multi method approach of Agglomerative Hierarchical
   Clustering (AHC), Fuzzy Delphi and Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and
   Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL). The results reveal that governance
   barriers and contextual barriers are causal and influence the other
   barriers. There is a need to enhance the capacity and optimum resource
   utilisation for developing circular supply chains; it is possible to
   facilitate CSCM practices only through collaborative efforts across
   sectors. The study also highlights that government policymaking and
   regulation, collaborative value capture model and Industry 4.0
   technologies are the most effective strategies for managing C-SC for
   CSCM. This study contributes to stakeholder theory and resource-based
   view theory by explicating collaboration among cross-sector stakeholders
   and highlighting the significance of resource optimisation through waste
   management.},

Abstract = {This study reviews Internet of Things (IoT) research in supply chain
   management (SCM) and logistics. A thorough review and bibliometric
   analysis were conducted to analytically and objectively unearth the
   knowledge development in IoT research within the context of SCM and
   logistics. The analysis started with the selection of 807 journal
   articles published over a two-decade period. Then, the articles were
   analyzed according to bibliometric parameters such as year of
   publication, sources, authors, and institutions. A keyword co-occurrence
   network was used to cluster the pertinent literature. Results of the
   review and bibliometric analysis reveal that IoT research has attracted
   significant attention from the SCM and logistics community. Three
   leading journals published widely on IoT and the fifteen most productive
   authors are identified. Based on the keyword co-occurrence clustering,
   the IoT literature in SCM and logistics is focalized on RFID technology,
   Industry 4.0 technologies, reverse logistics, and additionally covers
   various industries, such as the food, retailing, construction, and the
   pharmaceutical sector. The study provides researchers with a better
   understanding of IoT research in SCM and logistics and existing
   knowledge gaps for further research. Practitioners may benefit from the
   review to keep abreast of the current discussions and applications of
   IoT in diverse industrial sectors. To the best of the authors'

Journal = {FORESTS},

Abstract = {Much of the North American wood products industry was severely impacted
   by the recession of 2008-2009. In addition, many sectors within this
   industry face intense global competition. Against this backdrop, we
   examine economic opportunities for hardwood manufacturers to achieve
   greater competitive advantage via product customization, through a
   literature review and synthesis. We also discuss several related themes
   including agility, lean manufacturing, and clustering. We found that, in
   globally competitive environments, hardwood producers must be agile to
   adapt to economic conditions and dynamic customer demand. We discuss how
   some sectors of the hardwood industry have effectively exhibited
   customized production, and subsequently fared relatively well in the
   current economy. We conclude the synthesis by evaluating the importance
   of supply chains to achieving customization for hardwood producers. In
   the future, supply chains will need to be configured to rapidly respond
   to changing consumer demands, and pressure to provide more services will
   likely extend further back up the supply chain to hardwood sawmills. It
   is expected that sustainability practices, including green supply chain
   management, will impact operational and economic performance of hardwood
   firms as well.},

Journal = {INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {112},
Number = {8-9},
Pages = {1255-1271},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the B2B e-commerce
   (B2BEC) usage patterns of North American small- and medium-sized
   enterprises (SMEs) in their supply chains, the contextual factors that
   influence usage patterns, and the subsequent effects of these patterns
   on firm performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted an online survey of
   North American SMEs and obtained 229 responses. They utilized several
   statistical methods, including cluster analysis and profile analysis, to
   test five hypotheses.
   Findings - The TOE framework, supplemented with interorganizational
   factors, provides a valid theoretical guideline to study firms' B2BEC
   usage patterns. Three distinct types of B2BEC usage patterns -
   E-Limiteds, E-Leaders, and E-Laggards - emerged. Different sets of
   contextual factors contribute to the formation of these three patterns
   of B2BEC adoption. Higher levels of B2BEC usage result in stronger firm
   performance.
   Research limitations/implications - Future clustering variables could be
   more specific. The effects of other potential contextual factors should
   also be explored by future studies. This study can be replicated in
   other countries to determine whether the findings can be generalized.
   Practical implications - In light of the potential performance
   improvements that B2BEC adoption offers, managers should assess the
   risks associated with maintaining their current speed of e-business
   deployment versus the risks associated with escalating it. Organizations
   that have been more reactive should consider how well or ill their
   sluggish approach prepares them for navigating the inevitability of
   increasing sophistication in supply chain management.
   Originality/value - Limited empirical research exists on the B2BEC usage
   patterns of North American SMEs, the contextual factors that motivate
   them to adopt different B2BEC technologies in their supply chains, and
   how each of these usage patterns affects their performance. The current
   study contributes to the literature by shedding light on these issues.},

Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Recent technological developments indicate possible advancements in
   supply chain management (SCM). These innovations have attracted a lot of
   interest from industries including logistics, manufacturing, packaging,
   and transportation. The conventional systems, however, use centralised
   servers to control all operations, including the exchange of raw
   materials, making orders, dealing with buyers and sellers, and updating
   orders. The network's supply chain may thus be insecure as a result of
   every activity being routed via centralised servers. The danger is
   additionally increased by a number of difficulties, including
   scalability, data integrity, security, and availability. Block chain
   technology may be used in these circumstances to decentralise
   transaction processing and eliminate the need for a centralised
   controller. In this approach, the performance of the
   resource-constrained supply chain network is improved by the effective
   use of edge computing and priority data access. The Intelligent K-Means
   (IKM) clustering algorithm is suggested across the edge nodes in the
   current research to categorise the priority level of each piece of data.
   This classifier determines if the edge node has received data that is
   high priority or low priority. Low priority data is recorded in the log
   files for future data analysis. Then, to allow safe data flow in the
   open block chain while excluding outside parties, the High Priority
   Access based Smart Contract (HPASC) technique is deployed. The whole
   experiment was conducted in a Python environment, and variables
   including scalability, reaction time, throughput, and accuracy were
   studied. Current systems' constrained block sizes and fork creation
   lengthen the time transactions must wait before being processed. The
   suggested methodology is quicker and uses less storage space than
   current block chain systems. The results show that the suggested
   approach works better than current blockchain technology to raise the
   standard of supply chain management.},

Abstract = {Warehouses are crucial in supply chain management They are used to
   distribute and store products. In this study, we optimize storage
   location assignment decisions in a warehouse managed by a manufacturing
   firm. A mathematical model is introduced to solve the nonlinear mixed
   integer optimization problem (NLMIP), i.e., the Storage Location
   Assignment Problem (SLAP) by using historical data from warehouse
   management system (WMS). Clustering and ABC analysis are conducted based
   on the number of times two items are picked together and the picking
   frequency of items, respectively and results are embedded into our
   optimization model. Also, a greedy heuristic is developed to solve SLAP
   of the firm. Analysis results show that there is an improvement of up to
   49.99\% in total distances between filled slots and the I/O point due to
   proposed solution compared to that of the current system.},

Title = {Modelling in off-site construction supply chain management: A review and
   future directions for sustainable modular integrated construction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {310},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {Off-site construction (OSC) is an innovative and sustainable
   construction method. One of its critical success factors is the proper
   management of its supply chain (SC). Recently, significant research
   attention has been focused on the modelling of OSC-SC to improve its
   performance and sustainability. However, the literature still lacks a
   comprehensive review of the modelling studies on off-site construction
   -supply chain management (OSCSCM). Therefore, this research contributes
   by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date mapping and clustering of
   309 journal articles on the modelling of OSC-SC to identify its trends
   and gaps, and hence, highlight future research opportunities. To achieve
   these objectives, a mixed review method, consisting of scientometric and
   systematic reviews, is used. The scientometric review identifies the
   most prolific journals, researchers, cooccurrence network of keywords,
   and their citation bursts. On the other hand, the systematic review
   classifies the articles based on OSC type and supply chain (SC) stage.
   At each SC stage, the articles are further classified based on problem
   settings and solution methods. The results show that production problems
   have received the most attention (i.e., by 28\% of the included
   articles), followed by on-site construction (19\%), design (13\%), and
   logistics (7\%) problems. However, researchers are more inclined to
   address problems at multiple SC stages (33\%) due to the
   interrelationship between these stages. Besides, the systematic analysis
   shows that OSC-SC problems have been solved frequently by a variety of
   solution methods such as optimization (25\%), simulation (13\%) and
   building information modelling (BIM) (9.5\%). However, researchers tend
   more to integrate multiple solution methods (35\%) to address the
   complexities of OSC-SC problems. Finally, the included studies are
   classified based on the three sustainability dimensions. The results
   show that economic, environmental, and social sustainability dimensions
   have been considered in previous studies by 72\%, 24\%, and 4\%,
   respectively. Therefore, the study identifies research gaps at each SC
   stage of each OSC type to incentivize future studies to consider more
   environmental and social sustainability factors in OSC-SC models. Since
   modular integrated construction (MiC) has the highest prefabrication
   level, this study provides future research directions for sustainable
   supply chain management (SCM) in MiC. The present research is an
   important reference guide that helps researchers and practitioners to
   understand different problem settings and their solution methods in
   OSC-SCM.},

Abstract = {This comprehensive study aims to identify from a strategic perspective a
   new port classification approach based on port features and
   characteristics. Data of 3,685 ports worldwide have been collected, and
   25 dimensions with 62 factors have been identified and utilized to
   analyze and classify ports worldwide. The K-means clustering technique
   has been utilized to conduct the port classification process at several
   levels. First, ports have been classified into two general clusters (low
   capabilities and moderate-to-high capabilities). Then only ports with
   moderate-to-high potentials were classified and taxonomized. In addition
   to identifying and classifying ports with moderate-to-high capabilities,
   findings of the second round demonstrate the existence of three main
   clusters. The new port classification has been used to provide new
   insights about the top 50 terminal ports as a real case study. This
   innovative approach is valuable for most port-related decision-making
   situations and facilitates the global supply chain management processes.},

Abstract = {Collaboration between partners is a very popular subject in both
   logistics and decision support research. However, transport management
   is often taken into account only as an external cost, without
   integration in collaborative reasoning. This paper proposes a framework
   to assess collaborative solutions in the context of logistics and
   freight transport, as well as to describe the links between freight
   transport and supply chain management in terms of collaboration
   techniques. First the main concepts of collaborative logistics in the
   distribution and transport fields are presented, highlighting the links
   between collaboration, freight transport and supply chain management.
   Then, the method to assess collaborative logistics and freight transport
   solutions is proposed. This method includes a design scheme, a
   hierarchic clustering technique and a dominance analysis method to unify
   the assessment of each individual and prepare collaborative research for
   a common solution. After that, the method is applied to the assessment
   of five scenarios derived from a real situation for the urban area of
   Lyon (France) to illustrate how difficult convergence towards consensus
   is. The results show that a global optimal solution for the entire set
   of stakeholders is not easy to identify and how the proposed method can
   be helpful for decision makers to achieve a consensus of common

Abstract = {In the field of supply chain management (SCM), attracting and developing
   appropriate talent is critical for achieving most SCM goals, as
   extensive skills are necessary to do the job properly. In order to
   ensure that future-proof talent can continue to emerge in this
   discipline, the role of SCM executives is extremely important. Although
   many studies have been conducted in the field of talent management (TM),
   the future role of SCM executives has been mostly neglected in research.
   The present empirical study addresses this gap, taking into
   consideration the fourth industrial revolution, as innovation in
   technology continues to drive significant changes in the SCM field.
   Aiming to investigate the extent to which increasing digitalization is
   influencing the future role of SCM executives, a Delphi study with 103
   experts from industry, academics, and politics/associations was carried
   out. In order to identify meaningful topic clusters from the data, fuzzy
   c-means clustering was used. From an actor-network theory perspective,
   our results show that in some areas of TM, digitalization is leading to
   a strong fusion of SCM executives and digital technologies, as well as
   to a clear division of roles, in which either SCM leaders or technology
   will dominate in the future.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, almost all kind of electronic devices leave traces of their

   Moreover, spatial data streams management poses new challenges both for

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {In modern systems, there is a tendency to model issues more accurately
   with low computational cost and considering multiscale decision-making
   which increases the complexity of the optimization. Therefore, it is
   necessary to develop tools to cope with these new challenges. Supply
   chain management of enterprise-wide operations usually involves three
   decision levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. These decision
   levels depend on each other involving different time scales.
   Accordingly, their integration usually leads to multiscale models that
   are computationally intractable. In this work, the aim is to develop
   novel clustering methods with multiple attributes to tackle the
   integrated problem. As a result, a clustering structure is proposed in
   the form of a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) later converted
   into a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for clustering shape-based
   time series data with multiple attributes through a multi-objective
   optimization approach (since different attributes have different scales
   or units) and minimize the computational complexity of multiscale
   decision problems. The results show that normal clustering is closer to
   the optimal case (full-scale model) compared with sequence clustering.
   Additionally, it provides improved solution quality due to flexibility
   in terms of sequence restrictions. The developed clustering algorithms
   can work with any two-dimensional datasets and simultaneous demand
   patterns. The most suitable applications of the clustering algorithms
   are long-term planning and integrated scheduling and planning problems.
   To show the performance of the proposed method, it is investigated on an
   energy hub as a case study, the results show a significant reduction in
   computational cost with accuracies ranging from 95.8\% to 98.3\%.},

   Machine Learning (ML) in Supply Chain Management through bibliometric
   and network analysis, the authors are able to grasp key features of the
   contemporary literature. The study makes use of state-of-the-art
   analytical framework based on a unified approach to reveal insights from
   the present body of knowledge and the potentials for future research
   developments. Design/methodology/approach Unlike standard literature
   reviews, in SLR, a structured approach is followed. The approach enables
   utilizing contemporary tools and software packages such as R-package
   ``bibliometrix{''} and Gephi for exploratory and visual analytics. A
   number of clustering methods are employed to form clusters. Later,
   multivariate analysis methodologies are adopted to determine the
   dominant clusters for the influential co-cited references. Findings
   Using contemporary tools from Bibliometric Analysis (BA), the authors
   identify in an exploratory analysis, the influential authors, sources,
   regions, affiliations and papers. In addition, the use of network
   analysis tools reveals research clusters, topological analysis, key
   research topics, interrelation and authors' collaboration along with
   their patterns. Finally, the optimum number of clusters computed for
   cluster analysis is decided using a systematic procedure based on
   multivariate analysis such as k-means and factor analysis.
   Originality/value Modern-day supply chains increasingly depend on
   developing superior insights from large amounts of data available from
   diverse sources in unstructured and semi-structured formats. In order to
   maintain a competitive edge, the supply chains need to perform speedy
   analysis of big data using efficient tools that provide real-time
   decision-making insights. Such an analysis necessitates automated
   processing using intelligent ML algorithms. Through a BA followed by a
   detailed data visualization in a network analysis enabled grasping key
   features of the contemporary literature. The analysis is based on 155
   documents from the period 2008 to 2018 selected using a systematic
   selection procedure.},

Abstract = {In the past years, research in Social Network Analysis (SNA) has
   increased. Initially, the research area was limited to sociology and
   anthropology but has now been used in numerous disciplines. The business
   and management discipline has many potentials in employing the SNA
   approach due to enormous relational data, ranging from employees,
   stakeholders to organisations. The study aims to analyse the research
   trend, performance, and the utilisation of the SNA approach in business
   and management research. Bibliometric analysis was conducted by
   employing 2,158 research data from the Scopus database published from
   2001 to 2020. Next, the research quantity and quality were calculated
   using Harzing's Publish or Perish while VOSviewer visualised research
   topics and cluster analysis. The study found an upward trend pattern in
   SNA research since 2005 and reached the peak in 2020. Generally, six
   subjects under the business and management discipline have used SNA as a
   methodology tool, including risk management, project management, supply
   chain management (SCM), tourism, technology and innovation management,
   and knowledge management. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the
   study is the first to examine the performance and analysis of SNA in the
   overall business and management disciplines. The findings provide
   insight to researchers, academicians, consultants, and other
   stakeholders on the practical use of SNA in business and management
   research.},

Abstract = {Supply chain management is monitoring of activities involved in supply
   chain, for integrating and coordinating between suppliers,
   manufacturing, inventory and transportation both within and among
   members. The ultimate aim of supply chains is to reduce costs and
   increase market coverage. Procuring and purchasing requested items in a
   timely manner are the two most important issues for supply chain
   stockholders. Group purchasing is one of the purchasing strategies in
   supply chains. It offers great potential by ordering large volumes to
   decrease expenses which can increase services to customers. A clustering
   optimization approach is employed to model group purchasing for a set of
   pharmacies in the field of healthcare. The proposed model determines a
   cooperation strategy based on factors such as distance between
   pharmacies and procurement expenditure in this network. Moreover, the
   proposed multi-objective group purchasing model is optimized using both
   goal programming and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. To
   illustrate the application of the proposed model, designing a purchasing
   group organization for Chalus city pharmacies is investigated.
   Purchasing groups are established in the way that sum of pharmacies
   ordering quantity has been located in the second or the third level of
   discount rate. Thus, the results show that GPOs can take the advantage
   of this cooperation.},

Abstract = {In large urban agglomerations, various logistical problems arise due to
   high population density and deficient transport infrastructure. City
   logistics involves the efficient distribution of freight transport in
   urban areas and approaches to mitigate environmental impacts and traffic
   congestion. This paper aims to use a two-step cluster analytic approach
   to segmentation of EU27 capital cities based on their city logistics
   performance. To obtain primary outcomes, the log-likelihood measure in
   SPSS Statistics was used. The results can be used to identify the
   development and implementation of logistics measures in capitals across
   the EU. In addition to clustering, the statistical analysis evaluates
   the position of investigated cities concerning traffic congestions, and
   from an environmental point of view, the carbon dioxide produced from
   transport. The scrutiny delivers practical outlooks on how clustering
   can be undertaken and proves how the clusters can be used to plan city
   logistics and supply chain management. Finally, the paper deals with
   smart city indices from the perspective of sustainable mobility and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {32-46},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In every production process, suppliers have to decide whether an item
   should be produced and stored as inventory before an explicit purchase
   order is received (production in advance), or whether it should be
   produced only after such an order is received (production to order). We
   study the determinants of this firm-level choice. We present a simple
   conceptual framework to derive predictions that we subsequently test in
   the empirical analysis. We argue that an increment in buyers' spatial
   concentration benefits production in advance more in homogenous
   industries than in differentiated ones, while the benefits for
   production to order are larger as product differentiation increases.
   Consequently, the propensity to adopt one of the two production modes,
   following an increase in the number of local downstream buyers, changes
   according to the degree of product differentiation of the goods. Relying
   on a large data set of Italian manufacturing firms, we find empirical
   support to our ideas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and reduce the bullwhip effect
   in fuzzy environments by means of type-2 fuzzy methodology. In order to
   reduce the bullwhip effect in a supply chain, we propose a new method
   for demand forecasting. First, the demand data of a real steel industry
   in Canada is clustered with an interval type-2 fuzzy c-regression
   clustering algorithm. Then, a novel interval type-2 fuzzy hybrid expert
   system is developed for demand forecasting. This system uses Fuzzy
   Disjunctive Normal Forms (FDNF) and Fuzzy Conjunctive Normal Forms
   (FCNF) for the aggregation of antecedents. An interval type-2 fuzzy
   order policy is developed to determine orders in the supply chain. Then,
   the results of the proposed method are compared with the type-1 fuzzy
   expert system as well as the type-1 fuzzy time series method in the
   literature. The results show that the bullwhip effect is significantly
   reduced; also, the system has less error and high accuracy. (C) 2013

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {Reasonable logistics distribution network structure can not only
   effectively reduce the cost of logistics enterprises themselves but also
   reduce the social cost. Through effective supply chain management,
   enterprises can significantly reduce costs, improve competitiveness, and
   enhance their ability to resist risks. Because the single-level
   distribution network structure of production enterprises is not suitable
   for large-scale logistics distribution, this paper proposes a
   distribution network structure design that accords with economies of
   scale and establishes an enterprise supply chain optimization model
   based on the fuzzy clustering algorithm. Using this optimization method
   to optimize the inventory of enterprise logistics supply chain, the
   operation is fast, the result is correct and reasonable, and it can
   provide good decision support for the distribution network of logistics
   enterprises. Through information technology and modern management
   technology, we should effectively control and coordinate the logistics,
   information flow, and capital flow in the production and operation
   process and organically integrate the internal supply chain with the
   external supply chain for management, so as to achieve the goal of
   global optimization.},

   examine which topics, which research trend, and which new ideas
   contribute to the scientific journal fields of sustainable operation.
   Our results identified that energy related journals were the classic
   magazines in sustainable operation field and energy technology was the
   top topic. USA, UK and Germany had contributed the most journal articles
   in this field. With the rapid expansion of Asia, Asian scientists, like

   applied the combined method to the EORA database which covers 189
   countries and focused on the whole global supply chain networks in

   higher emissions that consist of sectors with higher structural path
   betweenness. Chinese emission clusters were identified from the global
   supply chain networks for the five countries in question and the
   betweenness of Chinese sectors tend to be higher values in the supply

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Travel scheme planning is a crucial operational-level decision to be
   made in travel supply chain management. We investigate an integrated
   self-driving travel scheme planning (ISTSP) problem to optimize routing,
   hotel selection, and time scheduling under several streams of
   personalized considerations: best site-viewing time windows, rest
   requirements, and preference for site visiting sequences. The travel
   scheme planning problem is formulated in two models: (i) total cost
   minimization, and (ii) bi-objective optimization with total cost
   minimization and tourists' utility maximization. A heuristic solution
   framework integrating multi-categorical attribute K-means clustering,
   dynamic programming algorithm, and constraint satisfaction procedure is
   designed to solve these two models. Finally, we provide illustrative
   examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed
   models and solution methods.},

Title = {The influence of logistics clustering on distribution capabilities: a
   qualitative study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL \& DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {46},
Number = {6},
Pages = {577-594},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore why and how firms with
   logistics-intensive operations such as fast-moving consumer good (FMCG)
   distributors benefit from residing in logistics clusters. In particular,
   this study seeks to fill a gap in the understanding of how logistics
   clustering may influence FMCG firms' distribution capabilities.
   Design/methodology/approach Three case studies of FMCG distributors
   geographically agglomerated within Q Logistics Cluster in Jordan serve
   to elaborate the existing theory of clustering. Data were collected from
   24 interviews as well as observational evidence of the FMCG
   distributors' outbound logistics operations. The unit of analysis was
   the interaction between FMCG distributors and other agents in the
   logistics cluster.
   Findings FMCG distributors tend to gravitate to clusters where logistics
   service providers and other FMCG firms co-locate. FMCG distributors
   interact intensively and benefit greatly from building ties with
   non-competitor distributors in a cluster. Informal personal relations,
   collaborative activities and knowledge sharing, learning opportunities
   and resource availability were found to act as mechanisms for generating
   distribution capabilities within a logistics cluster.
   Practical implications This study provides practical implications for
   FMCG logistics and distribution managers who make distribution centre
   (DC) location decisions. The study provides such managers and their
   firms with a deeper understanding of the importance of co-locating DCs
   in logistics clusters, and may help them in designing their supply
   networks.
   Originality/value This is the first scholarly work to uncover the
   various ways in which FMCG distributors benefit from logistics
   clustering and explain why they may differ in performance, building on
   observations of their capabilities. The study provides insight from an
   emerging market and encourages future researchers to conduct further
   studies on logistics clustering in order to bring relevant theory
   forward.},

Journal = {PRODUCTION PLANNING \& CONTROL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {16},
Pages = {1336-1348},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {Despite the growing awareness about Circular Economy (CE) in production
   and supply chain management, there is little evidence linking CE
   practices to environmental and economic performances, especially within
   the traditional wood furniture industry in Indonesia. As with other
   management practices, implementation of CE can be supported by various
   factors. Among these factors are the so-called environmental-oriented
   supply chain cooperation (ESCC) practices. The study reported in this
   paper has three purposes. First, to investigate how the different levels
   of ESCC practices will affect the CE practices across the traditional
   wooden furniture industry in Central Java, Indonesia; second, to
   investigate the relationship between varying ESCC practices (which is
   grouped based on the implementation of CE practices) on the CE-targeted
   performances; and third, to examine the role of ESCC practices as a
   moderating variable in the relationship between CE practices and
   CE-targeted performances. This study uses primary data which were
   collected through closed questionnaires to 190 valid samples of wooden
   furniture SMEs across the cities of Jepara, Kudus, Rembang, Semarang,
   Blora and Surakarta. The data were processed using confirmatory factor
   analysis (CFA), K-means clustering analysis, Multivariate Analysis of
   Variance (MANOVA) and regression analysis. The results indicated that,
   depending on the levels of ESCC practices, the SMEs could be grouped
   into leaders, followers and laggard, which also determined the extent to
   which they practised the CE principles. The study also elaborated on the
   interactions between ESCC and CE practices, and how these might affect
   the CE-targeted environmental and economic performances.},

Title = {An analysis of supply chain related graduate programmes in Europe},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {398-412},
Abstract = {Purpose - Motivated by a lack of studies in graduate level supply chain
   education, this research aims to explore trends in supply chain-related
   graduate programmes in Europe and to propose a framework for designing
   such programmes.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors determine ``knowledge{''} and
   ``skills{''} areas applicable to supply chain management (SCM) education
   and analyse supply chain-related graduate programmes published by the
   European Logistics Association in 2004. They revisit the same programmes
   in 2011 to determine the recent situation and the trends. The authors
   use cluster analysis to reveal the similarities and differences among
   these programmes.
   Findings - The authors find two distinct clusters: focused and
   diversified. Focused programmes offer modules in knowledge and skills
   areas apart from SCM at a negligible level and place more emphasis on
   SCM in 2011 when compared to 2004. Diversified programmes show a similar
   increase in the emphasis on SCM with more variety in the knowledge and
   skills areas.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors' findings are based on
   SCM programmes delivered in Europe and over two discrete time periods.
   Future research should seek to extend this analysis to other continents
   with larger samples and incorporate the industry perspective to
   determine the potential gap between what programmes offer and what
   industry requires.
   Practical implications - SCM-related graduate programmes continue to
   redefine themselves. Clustering predominantly serves the universities in
   reassessing and re-engineering their programmes, helps prospective
   graduates in their selection process and assists managers in their
   recruitment practices.
   Originality/value - This paper establishes a baseline for assessing
   SCM-related graduate programmes with respect to the knowledge and skills
   they offer and introduces a framework that may serve as a starting point
   for the design and positioning of such programmes.},

Abstract = {Last-mile delivery (LMD) has experienced tremendous growth in recent
   years, primarily driven by e-commerce. The LMD sector is characterized
   by strong competition, with new entrants addressing unexplored business

   develop projections of future consumer behavior, delivery technologies,
   delivery services, and regulation to validate them by conducting a
   two-round Delphi study among 36 experts from the LMD industry, academia,
   and politics. Based on the results, three future scenarios are
   identified by fuzzy c-means clustering, set within the context of
   innovation diffusion theory and the technology acceptance model. There
   is expert consensus on the scope of technologies that will be used in
   2040 and how consumers' preferences may change, but the future design of
   delivery services is less certain. The identified scenarios provide

   warehouse order picking operations},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {139},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This research presents a systematic and integrated approach that extends
   the correlated storage assignment strategy to improve the efficiency of
   warehouse order picking operations. The correlated storage assignment
   can reduce a significant amount of travel costs, but could lead to
   traffic congestion due to the imbalanced traffic flow. Hence, this
   research proposes the correlated and traffic balanced storage assignment
   (C\&TBSA) to minimize the travel time and picking delays, which is
   modeled in two stages: clustering and assignment. In the clustering
   stage, a bi-objective optimization model is formulated to group items
   with the consideration of both travel efficiency and traffic flow
   balance, which is solved using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms
   (MOEAs). In the assignment stage, items in each cluster are distributed
   to the available storage locations. C\& TBSA is evaluated with an actual
   warehouse case study and the results show that C\&TBSA outperforms
   random, class-based, and correlated storage assignment methods by
   48.74\%, 23.82\%, and 7.58\% respectively, regarding the total time
   consisting of travel time and picking delays.},

Journal = {COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-112},
Abstract = {Intrusion detection systems that have emerged in recent decades can
   identify a variety of malicious attacks that target networks by
   employing several detection approaches. However, the current approaches
   have challenges in detect-ing intrusions, which may affect the
   performance of the overall detection system as well as network
   performance. For the time being, one of the most important creative
   technological advancements that plays a significant role in the
   profes-sional world today is blockchain technology. Blockchain
   technology moves in the direction of persistent revolution and change.
   It is a chain of blocks that covers information and maintains trust
   between individuals no matter how far apart they are. Recently,
   blockchain was integrated into intrusion detection systems to enhance
   their overall performance. Blockchain has also been adopted in
   health-care, supply chain management, and the Internet of Things.
   Blockchain uses robust cryptography with private and public keys, and it
   has numerous properties that have leveraged security's performance over
   peer-to-peer networks without the need for a third party. To explore and
   highlight the importance of integrating blockchain with intrusion
   detection systems, this paper provides a comprehensive background of
   intrusion detection systems and blockchain technology. Further-more, a
   comprehensive review of emerging intrusion detection systems based on
   blockchain technology is presented. Finally, this paper suggests
   important future research directions and trending topics in intrusion

Abstract = {Rogue seasonality or unintended cyclic variability in order and other
   supply chain variables is an endogenous disturbance generated by a
   company's internal processes such as inventory and production control
   systems. The ability to automatically detect, diagnose and discriminate
   rogue seasonality from exogenous disturbances is of prime importance to
   decision makers. This paper compares the effectiveness of alternative
   time series techniques based on Fourier and discrete wavelet transforms,
   autocorrelation and cross correlation functions and autoregressive model
   in detecting rogue seasonality. Rogue seasonalities of various
   intensities were generated using different simulation designs and demand
   patterns to evaluate each of these techniques. An index for rogue
   seasonality, based on the clustering profile of the supply chain
   variables was defined and used in the evaluation. The Fourier transform
   technique was found to be the most effective for rogue seasonality
   detection, which was also subsequently validated using data from a steel
   supply network. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article outlines a hybrid method, incorporating multiple techniques
   into an evaluation process, in order to select competitive suppliers in
   a supply chain. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) model is
   constructed to calculate the weight of various factors, and get

   present to decide the backup suppliers. By performing Axiomatic Fuzzy
   Set (AFS) clustering method (X. D. Liu et al. IEEE Transaction on
   Systems, Man, Cybernetics, 2005), the final suppliers are selected and
   evaluated. In this paper, quantitative and qualitative factors, such as
   technical capability, product appearance, JIT capability, price,
   delivery rate and sale service rate are considered to determine suitable
   suppliers. Numerical example that fifteen suppliers and six criteria are
   studied and the experimental results show that the proposed evaluation
   framework is very well suited as supplier selection decisions even with
   the inter-correlation criteria/attributes.},

Title = {Managing Supply Chain Complexity and Sustainability: The Case of the

Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Consumer demand for organic products, rapidly growing urbanizations
   levels requires the food supply chain to reduce lead-time and maintain
   higher product quality. For the food supply chain to cope with the
   raising issues an e-commerce type of supply chain must be implemented.
   This approach creates challenges for supply chain, because the food
   industry must shift towards high variety and low quantity freight
   forwarding with multiple delivery points. The methodology of the paper
   consists of scientific literature analysis and macro indicator
   clustering. The author of the paper proposes a supply chain management
   framework, which is grounded through complexity theory. The framework
   mainly consists of 3 characteristics, which organizations should
   operationalize to maintain system resilience and which in the long-run
   would evolve to sustainable development-capabilities, collaboration,
   complexity management. The proposed framework defines how operational
   and tactical levels should be automated through cyber-physical systems,
   while the automation should be controlled through strategic level
   variables. The macro level analysis of existing EU markets of the food
   industry has been conducted to identify the food industry's
   contingencies, in which an agent-based model will be used to validate
   the proposed framework. Main 3 clusters were identified, which number
   was chosen based on the elbow method and validated with the silhouette
   score of 0.749. The food industry can be categorized in to developing,
   underdeveloped, and developed food industries. Moreover, singularities
   of different contingencies have been identified which considers
   population size, population density, market size of the food industry
   and disruption intensity. The application of the framework depends on
   the identified contingencies. From strategic level the SCMF is similar
   in all contingencies, however, depending on the type of market, more
   emphasize on vehicle routing or demand forecasting should be made.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to analyze the state of knowledge on the
   relationship between leadership and the firm's supply chain. The study
   identifies and examines the existing literature, unveils research gaps
   and suggests future research directions. Design/methodology/approach
   Adopting a systematic review process, a total of 110 articles published
   in top-ranked academic journals (A{*} and A category as per ABDC-2019
   list) were analyzed. Descriptive, cluster, thematic and regression
   analyses of citations were performed to garner insights. Findings The
   review outcome shows an upward trend of articles studying the influence
   of leadership in the supply chain. With the highest number of articles,
   developed countries and manufacturing companies have been the research
   contexts of the research studies. Clustering reveals eight significant
   areas where the leader's involvement in the supply chain is discussed,
   with several sub-themes emerging within each cluster. Finally, the
   regression analysis of citations shows that only the journal's quality
   matters the most in receiving the highest citation for the articles.
   Research limitations/implications As this study considered only A{*} and
   A-ranked journals of the ABDC-2019 list, there is a risk of excluding
   some relevant articles. Originality/value While the current literature
   deliberates on recent trends in the supply chain, such as the
   application of Industry 4.0 practices, this review revolves around the
   classical theme of leadership and demonstrates its importance in the
   supply chain. The study is among the first to conduct a bibliometric
   analysis of articles deliberating on leadership and supply chain issues
   by grouping the articles into clusters and themes. In the end, the
   clusters and themes were conceptualized into the ``House of Supply Chain

Abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brings about severe disruptions for
   human living, economics, and environmental balance. This pandemic has
   boosted the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and thus,
   medical wastes. Thus, a research hypothesis is stated whether it would
   be possible to provide more efficient distribution and inventory
   planning to optimize the PPE availability in a fuzzy environment. To
   confirm the hypothesis, in addition to addressing a scientific novelty
   considering integration of linear programming with fuzzy parameters,
   named as the Jimenez's method and clustering heuristic methods, the
   practicality of these approaches is provided on a real case study and
   generated instances from Turkey. The computational results reveal that
   clustering the 32\% of the hospitals ensures optimum total cost and
   solution time while feasibility degree changes between 0, 4, and 1
   values of the Jimenez are not more effective on the results. Improved
   cost results reveal the economic importance of the healthcare supply
   chain management and optimal PPE distribution and inventory planning can
   break down the disease propagation and reduce the detrimental impacts on
   human life. The proposed approach, for the first time, ensures practical
   and theoretical insights of distribution and storage decisions across

Abstract = {We study the delivery of mobile medical services and in particular, the
   optimization of the joint stop location selection and routing of the
   mobile vehicles over a repetitive schedule consisting of multiple days.
   Considering the problem from the perspective of a mobile service
   provider company, we aim to provide the most revenue to the company by
   bringing the services closer to potential customers. Each customer
   location is associated with a score, which can be fully or partially
   covered based on the proximity of the mobile facility during the
   planning horizon. The problem is a variant of the team orienteering
   problem with prizes coming from covered scores. In addition to
   maximizing total covered score, a secondary criterion involves
   minimizing total travel distance/cost. We propose a data-driven
   optimization approach for this problem in which data analyses feed a
   mathematical programming model. We utilize a year-long transaction data
   originating from the customer banking activities of a major bank in
   Turkey. We analyze this dataset to first determine the potential service
   and customer locations in Istanbul by an unsupervised learning approach.
   We assign a score to each representative potential customer location
   based on the distances that the residents have taken for their past
   medical expenses. We set the coverage parameters by a spatial analysis.
   We formulate a mixed integer linear programming model and solve it to
   near-optimality using Cplex. We quantify the trade-off between capacity
   and service level. We also compare the results of several models
   differing in their coverage parameters to demonstrate the flexibility of
   our model and show the impact of accounting for full and partial
   coverage.},

Title = {A novel learning based approach for a new integrated location-routing
   and scheduling problem within cross-docking considering direct shipment},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {274-285},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {One of the most important problem in supply chain management is the
   design of distribution systems which can reduce the transportation costs
   and meet the customer's demand at the minimum time. In recent years,
   cross-docking (CD) centers have been considered as the place that
   reduces the transportation and inventory costs. Meanwhile, neglecting
   the optimum location of the centers and the optimum routing and
   scheduling of the vehicles mislead the optimization process to local
   optima. Accordingly, in this research, the integrated vehicle routing
   and scheduling problem in cross-docking systems is modeled. In this new
   model, the direct shipment from the manufacturers to the customers is
   also included. Besides, the vehicles are assigned to the cross-dock
   doors with lower cost. Next, to solve the model, a novel
   machine-learning-based heuristic method (MLBM) is developed, in which
   the customers, manufacturers and locations of the cross-docking centers
   are grouped through a bi-clustering approach. In fact, the MLBM is a
   filter based learning method that has three stages including customer
   clustering through a modified bi-clustering method, sub-problems'
   modeling and solving the whole model. In addition, for solving the
   scheduling problem of vehicles in cross-docking system, this paper
   proposes exact solution as well as genetic algorithm (GA). GA is also
   adapted for large-scale problems in which exact methods are not
   efficient. Furthermore, the parameters of the proposed GA are tuned via
   the Taguchi method. Finally, for validating the proposed model, several
   benchmark problems from literature are selected and modified according
   to new introduced assumptions in the base models. Different statistical
   analysis methods are implemented to assess the performance of the
   proposed algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Driven by the growing concern regarding greenhouse gas emissions, in

   last years, CO2 allowance prices have undergone unexpected changes,
   having strong impact on the design and management of optimal SC. The
   consideration of uncertainty in the allowance prices has therefore
   become more important. We use an autoregressive integrated moving
   average (ARIMA) model to predict future allowance prices. A full
   discretization of the underlying probability space leads to a number of
   scenarios far too large to be handled, so we compare two approaches to
   reduce the number of scenarios to a feasible maximum, the ScenRed
   algorithm and K-means clustering. The obtained results are compared with
   a deterministic approach that is widely studied in the literature,

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the effective taxonomies
   of airline green operations strategy. Design/methodology/approach To
   this end, a sample of 23 airlines from five regions (North America,
   South America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East) was surveyed. The
   annual sustainability reports of the surveyed airlines for the period
   2013-2016 were retrieved from the Global Reporting Initiatives website.
   K-means clustering analysis was used to generate taxonomic clusters of
   airline green operations strategy. A special data analysis technique,
   called rank analysis, was also adopted to identify the significant green
   actions and develop indicative models. Findings This study revealed that
   three effective taxonomies were adopted by airlines: a low-effect
   strategic pattern, a low-to-moderate effect strategic pattern and a
   high-effect strategic pattern. A different combination of green
   operation actions characterized each strategic pattern.
   Originality/value The research contribution of taxonomies of green

   concentrated on the manufacturing sector. This study reported the
   taxonomies and performed an in-depth analysis of the categories of
   effective actions taken to promote green performance. Moreover, this
   study developed indicative models for the relationship between
   categories of action and green performance for each strategic pattern,
   an action that has seldom been reported by previous studies of green

Abstract = {The financial performance is an indicator of financial stability, health
   and condition of any organisation. It could be utilised as a proper
   measure of the firm's credibility and its ability to pay off debts.
   Financial institutions use this measure to determine the lending policy
   and applicants' credits. This study proposes a model based on the CCSD
   weighing method and hybrid FCM-ARAS approach for clustering and
   evaluating the financial performance to enable banks to identify target
   groups and design appropriate and relevant policies. Based on previous
   studies and the views of senior financial managers of a public bank in
   Iran, eight economic criteria were evaluated. The presented method was
   used to assess the financial performance of 58 manufacturing companies
   applying for loans from a federal bank in Iran. However, the CCSD method
   was used to calculate criteria weights, and a hybrid FCM-ARAS approach
   was developed and applied to financial evaluation and clustering the
   companies. The use of the CCSD method can eliminate errors caused by
   subjective models and human judgments, and increase the accuracy of the
   assessment. In this study, the debt ratio and equity to total assets and
   ROA were identified as the main criteria to assess financial
   performance.},

Title = {Exploring the relations between supply chain performance and
   organizational culture: A fuzzy grey group decision model},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {233},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Assessing the relationship between supply chain performance and
   organizational culture can help to predict scenarios and improve
   decision-making. However, this relationship is rarely explored due to
   the complexity of quantitatively addressing its natural subjectivity.
   Although soft computing techniques would have the potential to overcome
   this limitation, they have been rarely applied to this context. This
   paper aims to introduce a decision model to analyze and quantify the
   causal relationship between organizational culture and supply chain
   performance based on the combination of fuzzy grey cognitive maps, grey
   clustering and multiple fuzzy inference systems. Such model is novel in
   the literature and can provide new theoretical and practical
   perspectives. The development of this study is based on the SCOR (R)
   (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model attributes (SCC, 2017) and
   Hofstede's (2001) organizational practices, following the quantitative
   axiomatic prescriptive model based research. The main contribution is
   the introduction of a decision-making model that promotes the alignment
   between organizational culture and supply chain management,
   internalizing culture as a driver for performance improvement efforts.
   By conducting two real application cases in companies from different
   industrial sectors, results show that the model is able to identify
   crucial elements regarding cultural profile and performance for both
   organizations, aiding prioritization, anticipation and enabling the
   development of guidelines for action plans.},

Title = {Drivers for adopting reverse logistics in the construction industry: a
   qualitative study},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {134-157},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate and analyse the
   perceptions of South Australian construction practitioners on drivers
   affecting the implementation of reverse logistics (RL). In this context,
   RL is defined as the process of moving goods from their typical final
   destination for the purpose of capturing value or ensuring proper
   disposal.
   Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were conducted
   with eight practitioners to collect data and the interview transcripts
   were analysed using the NVivo (version 10) package. Cluster analysis was
   used to cross-validate the findings and provide an in-depth insight into
   the findings.
   Findings - The findings indicate that most of the drivers identified in
   earlier research are relevant for the construction industry. In
   addition, the study identified some new drivers that are categorised as
   ``targeted demands by an exclusive clientele{''}. These drivers were
   found to be complementary to the economic, environmental and social
   drivers as previously conceptualised. In addition, a set of factors
   affecting the strength of drivers that had been overlooked in previous
   studies emanated from the interview analysis. These include the type of
   project and the attributes of clients, both of which strongly affect the
   drivers of RL implementation in construction.
   Research limitations/implications - The major limitations are the
   relatively small size of the sample of interviewees and having
   interviewees from one geographic area with specific socio-economic
   characteristics.
   Practical implications - The identified drivers and the clustering of RL
   themes could be used by practitioners as a ``road map{''} for the
   development of appropriate solutions to successfully promote RL within
   the construction industry. Organisational energies could thus be
   channelled towards the drivers that need the most improvement.
   Originality/value - The study contributes to this research sphere by
   employing cluster analysis to customise and contextualise the drivers
   that were previously identified. The study goes beyond the extant
   literature by discovering the prominent effects of these drivers on the
   impact of targeted demands by an exclusive clientele. This could be of
   great value in terms of creating avenues for future investigations on
   the topic.},

Title = {Segmenting consumers for food defense communication strategies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION \& LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {39},
Number = {5},
Pages = {365-403},
Abstract = {Purpose - In the light of lessons learned from recent disasters (The
   London subway bombings, and Hurricane Katrina), it has become
   increasingly clear that supply chain partners as well as government
   agencies need to be prepared to communicate effectively to consumers and
   customers before, during and after a disaster. Effective communication
   can minimize confusion and harm to company reputations, to consumers,
   the economy and the nation. Incorporating consistent communications into
   supply chain management (SCM) plans used by all parties in the supply
   chain will enhance competitiveness of the whole chain and speed recovery
   from potentially disastrous events. Findings from a national survey of
   consumer's attitudes about terrorism provide information about the
   development of targeted and effective communications.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on a survey of more than 4,000 US
   consumers, this study used ``predictive segmentation{''} which consists
   of a canonical factor analysis relating general consumer attitudes and
   values to their more specific fears and concerns about terrorism. A
   clustering of consumers then identifies six diverse consumer segments
   providing a framework for the development of communication strategies.
   Findings - Results from this study demonstrate that people can be
   grouped based on their general attitudes' and values in such a way that
   their diversity can be captured in a simple framework of segments each
   reflecting striking differences in the level of concern over potential
   terrorist attacks.
   Practical implications - Guidance is offered for the development of
   communication strategies based on the information needs and media
   behavior of each consumer segment to mitigate the impact of a potential
   terrorist attack or catastrophic food safety breaches. It provides
   practical and logical extension of former studies that suggest
   incorporating consumers, attitudes into SCM and business continuity
   plans.
   Originality/value - This study leverages a common and proven marketing
   research approach segmentation used in private industry for the
   marketing of goods and service. It applies this method to defining
   segments of consumers based on their attitudes and concerns about
   terrorism that will be useful in supply chain communication management.},

Abstract = {Environmental management in the Chinese manufacturing industry has
   attracted global attention. Using environmental indicator data from 2001
   to 2010 for this industry, we empirically examine its environmental
   management efficiency using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and

   environmental management of the Chinese manufacturing industry has more
   DEA inefficiency than efficiency. Environmental management efficiency
   showed a significant decline before 2004, but rapid growth since 2007.
   Our findings also indicate that there is input redundancy and output
   insufficiency in the manufacturing industry's environmental management
   from 2002 to 2004. In addition, we found that most manufacturing sectors
   in China had consistently inefficient environmental management over the
   10 years under study. Overall, our findings reveal that efficiency
   remains low. Thus, the manufacturing industry's environmental management
   needs to improve from the perspective of enterprises and government. We
   hope that our study paves the way for future research into improving the
   manufacturing industry's environmental management in emerging countries.

Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},

Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide an analytical model for
   low carbon supplier development. This study is focused on the level of
   investment and collaboration decisions pertaining to emission reduction.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors' model includes a fuzzy c-means
   (FCM) clustering algorithm and a fuzzy formal concept analysis. First, a
   set of suppliers were classified according to their carbon performances
   through the FCM clustering algorithm. Then, the fuzzy formal concepts
   were derived from a set of fuzzy formal contexts through an
   intersection-based method. These fuzzy formal concepts provide the
   relative level of investments and collaboration decisions for each
   identified supplier cluster. A case from the Indian renewable energy
   sector was used for illustration of the proposed analytical model.
   Findings The proposed model and case illustration may help manufacturing
   firms to collaborate with their suppliers for improving their carbon
   performances.
   Research limitations/implications The study contributes to the low
   carbon supply chain management literature by identifying the decision
   criteria of investments toward low carbon supplier development. It also
   provides an analytical model of collaboration for low carbon supplier
   development. Though the purpose of the study is to illustrate the
   proposed analytical model, it would have been better if the model was
   empirically validated.
   Originality/value Though the earlier studies on green supplier
   development program evaluation have considered a set of criteria to
   decide whether or not to invest on suppliers, these are silent on the
   relative level of investment required for a given set of suppliers. This
   study aims to fulfill this gap by providing an analytical model that
   will help a manufacturing firm to invest and collaborate with its
   suppliers for improving their carbon performance.},

   Interval-Valued Orthopair Fuzzy Environment},
Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As enterprises pay more and more attention to environmental issues, the
   green supply chain management (GSCM) mode has been extensively utilized
   to guarantee profit and sustainable development. Green supplier
   selection (GSS), which is a key segment of GSCM, has been investigated
   to put forward plenty of GSS approaches. At present, enterprises prefer
   to construct the large-scale teams of decision makers to obtain the more
   reasonable ranking results during GSS process. However, the existing
   methods pay little attention to the large-scale GSS procedure. To
   investigate the GSS issue with a large-scale group of decision makers, a
   new GSS approach under a q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy
   environment is developed. The q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy
   numbers are introduced to describe the evaluation information of green
   suppliers. Combined with a clustering approach and several clustering
   principles, the large-scale decision makers are divided into several
   subgroups. Next, the similarity measures between the evaluation matrices
   are computed to determine the weights of subgroups, and the collective
   evaluation information can be obtained using the q-rung interval-valued
   orthopair fuzzy aggregation operator. According to the weighted entropy
   measure, the weights of criteria are calculated; then, the q-rung
   interval-valued orthopair fuzzy multi-objective optimization on the
   basis of ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form
   (q-RIVOF-MULTIMOORA) method is constructed to determine the best green
   supplier. At last, a practical GSS example is applied to show the
   feasibility of the proposed approach, and the sensitivity and
   comparative analyses indicate that for the large-scale GSS issues, the
   proposed approach can obtain the more robust and reasonable ranking
   results.},

   During Disruptions: A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {115603-115623},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis has attracted attention worldwide to supply chain
   disruptions and resilience. Several supply chain risk management
   approaches have been revisited or reapplied in the literature; however,
   collaborative resource sharing is less researched. This study aimed to
   investigate the current academic state of the art and advances in using
   collaborative resource sharing as a reactive method to facilitate supply
   chain recovery in the presence of disruptive events. More specifically
   we considered the role of different collaborative resource-sharing
   strategies that organizations can adopt to support supply chain
   functionalities during times of disruption. We conducted a systematic
   literature review (SLR) to analyze academic articles that were published
   online from 2000 to 2022. In order to analyze the literature, we adopted
   a combination of text-mining, automatic and manual categorization of
   selected articles, and exploratory analyses such as cluster analysis and
   relational indicators. We also consider the machine learning
   classification algorithm i.e. agglomerative hierarchical clustering for
   the categorization of clusters. The findings show that, for disruptive
   risks, collaborative sharing of labour and material resources is
   effective for the recovery of supply chains. More so, labour resources
   tend to contribute more to the recovery of supply chains through the
   physical and mental recreation of recovery activities and experiences.
   Whilst information resources and a mix of information and material
   resources are highly important in reducing the impact of COVID-19
   disruptive supply chain risk. In conclusion, collaborating on the three
   resources, namely labour, material, and information resources can be an
   effective post-disruption recovery strategy for supply chains.},

   challenges, especially stock out of iCCM commodities and inadequate
   supportive supervision of community health workers (CHWs). This study
   aimed to address these two key challenges to successful iCCM
   implementation by using mobile health (mHealth) technology.
   Methods This cluster randomised controlled trial compared health centre
   catchment areas (clusters) where CHWs and their supervisors implemented
   mHealth-enhanced iCCM supportive supervision and supply chain management
   vs clusters implementing iCCM as per current Zambian guidelines. CHWs in
   intervention clusters used community DHIS2 platform on mobile phones to
   report on a weekly basis children with iCCM conditions and make
   requisitions for iCCM commodities. Their supervisors received electronic
   reports on disease caseloads and monthly automated supervision
   reminders. The supervisors on receipt of requisitions, organized the
   medical supplies and notified CHWs for collection. Intention-to-treat
   analysis on the primary outcome, the percentage of children aged 2-59
   months receiving appropriate treatment for malaria, pneumonia, or
   diarrhoea from an iCCM trained CHW, was performed using a generalized
   linear model. Prevalence ratios and 95\% confidence intervals comparing
   the prevalence of appropriate treatment in the intervention and control
   groups were calculated using log binomial regression with an
   exchangeable correlation matrix, adjusted for clustering by health
   facility.
   Results In the intervention clusters, 61.3\% (98/160) of expected
   monthly supervision visits took place vs 52.0\% (78/150) in the
   controls. A total of 3690 children 2-59 months old presented with
   malaria, diarrhoea, or pneumonia. In the intervention group, 65.9\%
   (1,252/1,899) of children received appropriate care for iCCM conditions,
   compared to 63.3\% (1,134/1,791) in the control group. The mHealth
   intervention was associated with 18.0\% improvement in supportive
   supervision and 21.0\% increase in appropriate treatment for pneumonia;
   these changes were not statistically significant. There was a 2-3-fold
   increase in the proportion of CHWs receiving supplies ordered:
   prevalence ratios ranged from 2.82 (confidence interval (CI) =1.50,
   5.30) to 3.01 (95\% CI =1.29, 7.00) depending on the particular
   commodity.
   Conclusion This study was unable to determine whether using mHealth
   technology would strengthen supervision and supply chain management of
   iCCM commodities for community-level workers. There was no statistically
   significant effect of mHealth enhanced iCCM on appropriate diagnosis and
   treatment for children with malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhoea in rural
   Zambia. Longer term longitudinal studies are required to determine the
   impact of mHealth enhanced iCCM on health outputs and outcomes.},

Title = {Optimized Supply Chain Management of Rice in South Korea:
   Location-Allocation Model of Rice Production},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Planning for optimized farming with the aim of providing ideal site and
   cultivar selection is critical for a stable and sustainable supply of
   rice with sufficient quantity and quality to customers. In this study, a
   range of morphological characteristics and yield of eight rice cultivars
   that are commonly cultivated in Korea were investigated from 2005 to
   2020. All morphological characteristics were significantly different
   among the eight rice cultivars. The dataset of morphological
   characteristics and yield was used to isolate groups of similar rice
   cultivars. The k-means clustering method was used to group the rice
   cultivars. Three groups (Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3) were created.
   Most cultivars were in Group 1. High-yielding rice cultivars were in
   Group 2, while the rice cultivars in Group 3 had the lowest rice grain
   yield. After grouping these rice cultivars, ideal farming locations for
   all three rice cultivar groups were identified to reduce transportation
   cost using an optimized location-allocation model. Simulation results
   suggested the following: (1) Group 1 should be produced in Jellanam-do
   (south west region), (2) Group 2 should be produced in Chungcheongnam-do
   (central west region), and (3) Group 3 should be mainly produced in the
   central west region of South Korea. Simulation results showed the
   potential to reduce transportation cost by around 0.014\%. This can also
   reduce 21.04 tons of CO2 emission from a freight truck. Because these
   eight cultivars only make up 19.76\% of the total rice production in
   South Korea, the cost reduction proportion was only 0.014\% of total
   revenue. In future studies, more rice cultivars should be investigated
   to increase the efficiency of the model performance.},

Title = {Localization: The revolution in consumer markets},
Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {84},
Number = {4},
Pages = {82+},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Standardization has been a powerful strategy in consumer markets, but
   it's reached the point of diminishing returns. Ana diversity is not the
   only chink in standardization's armor: Attempts to build stores in the
   remaining attractive locations often meet fierce resistance from
   community activists. From California to Florida to New Jersey,
   neighborhoods are passing ordinances that dictate the sizes and even
   architectural styles of new shops. Building more of the same-long the
   cornerstone of retailer growth-seems to be tapped.., as a strategy.
   Of course, a company can't customize every element of its business in
   every location. Strategists have begun to use clustering techniques to
   simplify and smooth out decision making and to focus their efforts on
   the relatively small number of variables that usually drive the bulk of
   consumer purchases.
   The customization-by-clusters approach, which began as a strategy for
   grocery stores in 1995, has since proven effective in drugstores,
   department stores, mass merchants, big-box retailers, restaurants,
   apparel companies, and a variety of consumer goods manufacturers.
   Clustering sorts things into groups, so that the associations are strong
   between members of the same cluster and weak between members of
   different clusters.
   In fact, by centralizing data-intensive and scale-sensitive functions
   (such as store design, merchandise assortment, buying, and supply chain
   management), localization liberates store personnel to do what they do
   best: Test innovative solutions to local challenges and forge strong
   bonds with communities.
   Ultimately, all companies serving consumers will face the challenge of
   local customization. We are advancing to a world where the strategies of
   the most successful businesses will be as diverse as the communities
   they serve.},

Title = {Data driven robust optimization for handling uncertainty in supply chain
   planning models},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {246},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {While addressing supply chain planning under uncertainty, Robust
   Optimization (RO) is regarded as an efficient and tractable method. As
   RO involves calculation of several statistical moments or maximum /
   minimum values involving the objective functions under realizations of
   these uncertain parameters, the accuracy of this method significantly
   depends on the efficient techniques to sample the uncertainty parameter
   space with limited amount of data. Conventional sampling techniques,
   e.g. box/budget/ellipsoidal, work by sampling the uncertain parameter
   space inefficiently, often leading to inaccuracies in such estimations.
   This paper proposes a methodology to amalgamate machine learning and
   data analytics with RO, thereby making it data-driven. A novel neuro
   fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to cluster the uncertain space
   such that the exact regions of uncertainty are optimally identified.
   Subsequently, local density based boundary point detection and Delaunay
   triangulation based boundary construction enable intelligent Sobol based
   sampling to sample the uncertain parameter space more accurately. The
   proposed technique is utilized to explore the merits of RO towards
   addressing the uncertainty issues of product demand, machine uptime and
   production cost associated with a multiproduct, and multisite supply
   chain planning model. The uncertainty in supply chain model is
   thoroughly analysed by carefully constructing examples and its case
   studies leading to large scale mixed integer linear and nonlinear
   programming problems which were efficiently solved in GAMS (R)
   framework.Demonstration of efficacy of the proposed method over the box,
   budget and ellipsoidal sampling method through comprehensive analysis
   adds to other highlights of the current work. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The contradiction between the contribution of city logistics (CL) to
   sustainable urban development and its negative externalities is
   increasingly prominent. Policy supervision measures and the green
   logistics initiative are also in conflict with the management goal of
   logistics enterprises. Innovative solutions for CL have attracted
   increasing research attention worldwide. However, the description of the
   global research network in the field of CL, research trends, and the
   discussion of advanced theories and practices have not been
   systematically reviewed so far. Especially in the past three years,
   there has been an explosive growth of relevant literature. In this
   paper, the method of combining scientometric analysis and thematic
   discussion was adopted to systematically review 513 important works in
   the literature from 1993 to 2018, aiming to provide a holistic
   understanding of the status in quo, trends and gaps of CL research, and
   to further analyze prominent problems. The study has made statistical
   analyses of the publication year profile, journal allocation and
   research methods of the included literature, and constructed four kinds
   of visualized bibliographic information timeline maps for the authorship
   network, international collaboration network, keywords co-occurrence
   network and research topic clustering. Then, the three themes summarized
   by clustering are discussed, mainly focusing on CL strategies and
   policy, green supply chain management, planning methods, and advanced
   concepts and practices. Finally, the research gaps framework and agenda
   were reported. This study contributes to summarizing the research and
   development of city logistics on the whole, and can also serve as an
   explorative manual to support sustainable urban freight activities and
   innovative research.},

Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Sales forecasting is even more vital for supply chain management in
   e-commerce with a huge amount of transaction data generated every
   minute. In order to enhance the logistics service experience of
   customers and optimize inventory management, e-commerce enterprises
   focus more on improving the accuracy of sales prediction with machine
   learning algorithms. In this study, a C-A-XGBoost forecasting model is
   proposed taking sales features of commodities and tendency of data
   series into account, based on the XGBoost model. A C-XGBoost model is
   first established to forecast for each cluster of the resulting clusters
   based on two-step clustering algorithm, incorporating sales features
   into the C-XGBoost model as influencing factors of forecasting.
   Secondly, an A-XGBoost model is used to forecast the tendency with the
   ARIMA model for the linear part and the XGBoost model for the nonlinear
   part. The final results are summed by assigning weights to forecasting
   results of the C-XGBoost and A-XGBoost models. By comparison with the
   ARIMA, XGBoost, C-XGBoost, and A-XGBoost models using data from
   Jollychic cross-border e-commerce platform, the C-A-XGBoost is proved to
   outperform than other four models.},

Abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, stems from
   the rapid advancement of digital technologies such as the Internet of
   Things and Cyber-Physical Production Systems. It has the potential to
   weave positive changes to firms and impact organizational structure
   layers. Therefore, it provides an impetus for the collaboration of
   factories, suppliers, and customers. Nevertheless, due to the difference
   of Industry 4.0 vision among companies, there is a lack of unified
   perception and approach of its implementation roadmap. Therefore, many
   firms in both developed and developing countries that step in the way of
   digital transformation encounter not only organizational, technological,
   and operational challenges but are also compelled to cope with a large
   deal of confusion. Hence, this paper aims to identify the main concepts,
   characteristics, and technology enablers related to Industry 4.0 to
   provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of this paradigm. It
   then clusters and matches the derived concepts and characteristics
   associated with Industry 4.0. Further, the paper provides an analysis of

Abstract = {Performance evaluation of suppliers is increasingly recognized as a
   critical indicator in supply chain cooperation. Traditional performance
   evaluation methods have the problems of a simple buy/sell relation and
   in one's subjective views between manufacturers and suppliers, and they
   lack objective automatic evaluation processes in the supply chain
   considered. Statistical techniques used for evaluation rely on the
   restrictive assumptions of linear separability, multivariate normality,
   and independence of the predictive variables. Unfortunately, many of the
   common models of performance evaluation of suppliers violate these
   assumptions. The study proposes an integrated model by combining K-means
   clustering, feature selection, and the decision tree method into a
   single evaluation model to assess the performance of suppliers and
   simultaneously tackles the above-mentioned shortcomings. The integrated
   model is illustrated with an empirical case study of a manufacturer for
   an original design manufacturer (ODM) to demonstrate the model
   performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method
   outperforms listed methods in terms of accuracy, and three redundant
   attributes can be eliminated from the empirical case. Furthermore, the
   extracted rules by the decision tree C4.5 algorithm form an automatic

Abstract = {The considerations of global sustainability have dramatically increased
   the importance of the remanufacturing process. Many scholars have
   started focusing on this vital area from both a management and an
   engineering point of view. Previous studies have aimed to categorize
   this area using traditional review approaches, using a smaller body of
   literature and mostly focusing on the managerial aspects of
   remanufacturing. Our paper is the only study for which tech-mining and
   scientometric methods are used to examine remanufacturing research, for
   the purpose of identifying top actors and key trends with regard to
   business and technological approaches. We combine both management- and
   engineering-related studies in this scientometric study. The results
   shed light on the principal actors, nations, organizations, and
   scientific domains in this field. Remanufacturing research is
   categorized using the co-occurrence-based clustering method. This paper
   identifies four broad research clusters: production planning and control
   of remanufacturing, material and remanufacturing engineering, supply
   chain management of remanufacturing process, and remanufacturing
   applications and new trends. This paper offers benefits to numerous
   parties: policymakers in the remanufacturing field, academics who wish

   environment for the IoT industry. Two dynamic time wrapping (DTW)
   networks are created to analyze the topological structures of the IoT

   networks are revolutionary in terms of their interconnectedness in the
   IoT industry. We found that the level of clustering and transitivity of
   the network continued to decline between 2010 and 2019; i.e., the
   efficiency of financial risk contagion on IoT networks was significantly
   reduced. This article contributes to the literature in two aspects.
   First, it reveals that China's IoT industry is increasingly competitive;
   financial risks have become more difficult to transfer. The IoT industry
   has become more robust and exhibits a lower likelihood of financial risk
   contagion. Second, the article provides empirical evidence for the
   theory of coevolution, showing that risk contagion ability in an

Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the food industry has received
   increasing attention in recent years. Many scholars have paid attention
   to case studies and other empirical analyses in this field, but there is
   no systematic or scientific literature review. The purpose of this study
   is to quantitatively evaluate the knowledge structure, research
   hotspots, and development history in CSR in the food industry. After
   searching, screening, and commenting, 498 articles were left for
   citation analysis, co-citation analysis, and co-word analysis. The main
   findings of the research are as follows: (1) The overall development
   status of the research in the field. The analysis of the three fields
   that constitute the knowledge structure. (2) Research in this field has
   become a hot spot, but the research is rather scattered, and the
   scholars and experts do not have a special research core. (3) The
   keywords' cluster results in 9 clustering tags, which are further
   grouped into 7 groups. The research of the scholars focuses on the food
   supply chain, consumer perception, and social media communication. (4)
   The research topics in this field focus on environmental responsibility,
   nutrition and health, and food safety. The research results show that
   future research should be more in-depth and reflect the new
   characteristics of the Internet, digitalization, and big data.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MECHANICAL DESIGN SYSTEMS AND MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Mass customization is an important strategy to improve production
   systems to satisfy customers' preferences while maintaining production
   efficiency for mass production. Module production is one of the ways to
   achieve mass customization, and products are produced by combining
   modules. In the module production, it becomes much more important for
   manufacturing companies to reflect customers' preferences for selling
   products. The manufacturer can increase its total profit by providing
   customized products that satisfy customers' preferences by increasing
   customers' satisfaction. In conventional production planning, there are
   some cases where module production is conducted by the demands from
   customers' preferences. However, the customer decision-making model has
   not been employed in the production planning model. In this paper, a
   production planning model incorporating customers' preferences is
   developed. The customers' purchasing behavior is generated by using a
   machine learning model. Customer segmentation is conducted by clustering
   data that uses the purchase data of multiple customers. The resulting
   production planning model is a bilevel production planning problem
   consisting of a single company and multiple customers. Each company can
   sell products that combine modules that customers require in each
   segment. We show that the proposed model can obtain higher customers'
   satisfaction with greater profits than the model that does not employ
   the customers' purchasing model.},

Title = {Sequential optimization of process and supply chains considering
   re-refineries for oil and gas circularity},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {322},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26 held in 2021
   concluded a global effort to hasten the energy transition toward a
   net-zero emission industry. As such, green initiatives, which transition
   the conventional oil and gas (O\&G) sector towards a circular economy
   (CE) are necessary. In this work, the integration of waste oil
   re-refining technology is proposed as a potential strategy to enhance
   the circularity of the O\&G industry. A two-step sequential model, which
   incorporates multiple systematic analytical tools (e.g., multi-objective
   decision analysis, information entropy, geospatial information,
   clustering, and routing analysis) is developed to determine: (i) optimal
   waste oil re-refinery technologies, and (ii) optimal supply chain
   design, which addresses the location for setting up the process
   facilities and the delivery routes, with the consideration of both
   economic and environmental performances. The effectiveness of the
   proposed strategy is demonstrated through a case study in Malaysia (that
   covers both East and West Malaysia). The analysis showed that the
   proposed strategy is capable of improving economic and environmental
   performances by about 9.59\% and 46.55\%, respectively. This work is
   essentially a useful reference for decision-makers and policymakers in
   making nationwide transition planning in the O\&G sector.},

Pages = {182-190},
Abstract = {Our study examined relationships among pellet mills, bulk delivery
   companies, and high-efficiency pellet boiler equipment firms in northern
   New England as they relate to homeowner satisfaction, using social
   network analysis and the concept of supply chain management. The
   continual growth of supply and demand for automated pellet heating
   requires a careful match between innovative technologies and homeowner
   needs; these involve multiple factors and require collaboration among
   firms. Using interview data with managers from pellet mills, bulk
   delivery companies, and equipment firms in Maine, New Hampshire, and
   Vermont, we found 15 firms that are connected through both a transaction
   network and an informal business interaction network. The networks were
   characterized by short paths and no obvious sign of centralization.
   Network statistics reported for each network included density,
   clustering coefficient, and degree, closeness, and betweenness
   centrality. Most firms in the supply networks shared customer
   satisfaction information (average number of information sending ties =
   3) and considered collaboration in customer services important (mean =
   4.4, on a 5-point scale). However, equipment firms initiated more
   information sharing than other types, and bulk delivery companies were
   in the best position in the supply network to promote collaborative
   customer services. Opportunities exist to improve communication between
   pellet mills and equipment firms, leading to a robust automated pellet
   heating supply chain, strong demand, and subsequent homeowner
   satisfaction.},

Abstract = {Detection of emerging fields in any industry is of great importance to
   the industrialists, engineers and policy makers of business as well as
   state administration. Exact awareness of the paradigm which governs
   current research activities and chances of likely paradigm shifts which
   could redefine the research approaches, is very crucial for the actors
   of scientific community and policy makers. Excellent technologies in IT,
   even accelerated the scientific and applied ontological pursuit in both
   academia as well as industry. In this work, network approach is
   advocated for the identification of innovations, new paradigms and
   emerging fields in the IT industry in the research area `engineering'.
   The network is a scientific network of research publications which
   reflects the volume and flow of scientific activities. Centrality
   analysis, path analysis, cluster analysis, etc. are used to identify the
   key papers of paradigm shifts, emerging fields, relatively important
   clusters and works respectively. A new metric, flow vergence index is
   devised for cluster analysis, The paradigm shift identified from this
   network is REID technology, related with the supply chain management.
   With proper economic and policy supports, there are some good reasons to
   look forward for more wonders from the industry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Design of a Support System for Complicated Logistics Location
   Integrating Big Data},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Logistics location is an important component of logistics planning that
   affects traffic pressure and vehicle emissions. To date, there has not
   been an adequate study of the integration of big data into the location
   for a complicated logistics system. This study developed a decision
   support system that can address location problems for complicated
   logistics systems, e.g., a multilevel urban underground logistics system
   (ULS), using logistics big data. First, information needed in the
   logistics location, such as the traffic performance index (TPI) and the
   origin/destination (OD) matrix, was collected and calculated using a big
   data platform, and this information was digitized and represented based
   on a geographic information system (GIS) tool. Second, a two-stage
   location model for a ULS was designed to balance the construction costs
   and traffic congestion. The first stage is establishing a set-covering
   model to identify optimum locations for secondary hubs based on the ant
   colony optimization algorithm, and the second stage is clustering of the
   secondary hubs to determine locations for primary hubs using the
   iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm (ISODATA).
   Finally, the Xianlin district of Nanjing, China, was chosen as a case
   study to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The system
   can be used to facilitate logistics network planning and to promote the
   application of big data in logistics.},

Title = {A Retrospective and Foresight: Bibliometric Review of International
   Research on Strategic Management for Sustainability, 1991-2019},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Over the past 30 years, scholars have been calling for modern management
   theory and research to consider how strategic management tools could be
   applied to enhance corporate sustainability. While strategic management
   for sustainability has emerged as a multidisciplinary field, the
   existing knowledge base has yet to be systematic reviewed. This paper
   responded to the literature gap by conducting a bibliometric review of
   strategic management for sustainability. The paper aimed to document the
   landscape and composition of this literature through the analysis of 988
   relevant Scopus-indexed documents. Data analyses found that the
   strategic management for sustainability knowledge base remained an
   emergent field with increasing interests from diverse groups of
   international scholars in various fields, particularly in environmental
   science, engineering, and strategic business management. Over the past
   three decades, the literatures have been continuously grown from a few
   publications in the early 1990s to almost 1000 documents to date. The
   review found that the most influential journals and authors of this
   knowledge base were international in scope but predominately from
   Western developed countries. Five Schools of Thought from author
   co-citation analysis revealed the intellectual clustering composition of
   the knowledge base on strategic management for sustainability: corporate
   sustainability strategy, sustainable waste management, strategic
   sustainability systems, strategic sustainability management and
   entrepreneurship, and sustainability assessment strategy. Key topics
   addressed in this research include the distribution of documents across
   the most highly cited journals, reflecting the breadth, quality and
   influential scholars in the strategic management for sustainability
   knowledge domain, naming of the influential scholars in the field and
   identification of contemporary foci and research front in the existing
   literature through the keyword co-occurrence analysis and co-word map.
   The strategic management for sustainability field has evolved from the
   key topics related to the green movement at the policy-driven macro
   level (i.e., ecological or environmental protection/impact, water/waste
   management and natural resource conservation) to the practicality in
   organizations with the topics related to social strategic responsibility
   and business management issues (i.e., corporate strategy, project
   management, supply chain management, information management, adaptive
   management, corporate sustainability). In addition to a retrospective,
   insightful prospective interpretation, practical implication,
   limitations and future research direction are discussed.},

Abstract = {This study examines how the application of the IoT in smart cities is
   discussed in the current academic literature. Based on bibliometric
   techniques, 1,802 articles were retrieved from the Scopus database and
   analyzed to identify the temporal nature of IoT research, the most
   relevant journals, authors, countries, keywords, and studies. The
   software tool VOSviewer was used to build the keyword co-occurrence
   network and to cluster the pertinent literature. Results show the
   significant growth of IoT research in recent years. The most productive
   authors, journals, and countries were also identified. The main findings
   from the keyword co-occurrence clustering and an in-depth qualitative
   analysis indicate that the IoT is used alongside other technologies
   including cloud computing, big data analytics, blockchain, artificial
   intelligence, and wireless telecommunication networks. The major
   applications of the IoT for smart cities include smart buildings,
   transportation, healthcare, smart parking, and smart grids. This review
   is one of the first attempts to map global IoT research in a smart city
   context and uses a comprehensive set of articles and bibliometric

Title = {Shopping Hard or Hardly Shopping: Revealing Consumer Segments Using
   Clickstream Data},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {The recent rise of big data analytics is transforming the apparel
   retailing industry. E-retailers, for example, effectively use large
   volumes of data generated as a result of their day-to-day business
   operations data to aid operations and supply chain management. Although
   logs of how consumers navigate through an e-commerce website are readily
   available in a form of clickstream data, clickstream analysis is rarely
   used to derive insights that can support marketing decisions, leaving it
   an under-researched area of study. Adding to this research stream by
   exploring the case of a U.K.-based fast-fashion retailer, this article
   reveals unique consumer segments and links them to the revenue they are
   capable of generating. Applying the partitioning around medoids
   algorithm to three random samples of 10 000 unique consumer visits to
   the e-commerce site of a fast-fashion retailer, six consumer segments
   are identified. This article shows that although the ``mobile window
   shoppers{''} segment consists of the largest consumer segment, it
   attracts the lowest revenue. In contrast, ``visitors with a purpose,{''}
   although one of the smallest segments, generates the highest revenue.
   The findings of this article contribute to marketing research and inform
   practice, which can use these insights to target customer segments in a
   more tailored fashion.},

Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {491-510},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Purpose A number of governments are making building information modeling
   (BIM) a mandatory requirement for all public works construction
   projects. While main contractors may be ready to comply with such
   requirements, the supply chain as whole may be vulnerable as lower-tier
   suppliers may not be able to adopt BIM. There is currently no objective
   approach to assessing BIM maturity; hence, this paper aims to develop a
   new approach to determine suppliers' current vision and execution-based
   capabilities to exploit BIM and their capacity to reach a higher
   maturity level. Design/methodology/approach Based on UK Government BIM
   maturity levels, the authors exploit a unique data set made available by
   a main contractor, to determine a data-driven approach, using K-means,
   to assess the capabilities and vision of its supply base. Findings The
   authors find a direct comparison between our suggested K-means clusters
   and the UK Government's BIM maturity levels. However, in interrogating
   specific cases, the authors find that using a subjective approach would
   have wrongly categorized certain companies. The authors also determine
   what capability and strategic developments are required for companies to
   move to a higher level. Practical implications The research may be
   exploited by companies to take a strategic approach to assess suppliers
   in BIM adoption and to establish supplier development mechanisms.
   Originality/value The data-driven approach avoids ambiguity of
   categories and mis-categorizing suppliers.},

   review existing literature to ascertain recent developments and uncover
   future areas of research. Despite the increasing number of publications
   on BNs in the domain of SC uncertainty, an extensive review on their
   application to SC risk and resilience is lacking. To address this gap,
   we analyzed research articles published in peer-reviewed academic
   journals from 2007 to 2019 using network analysis, visualization-based
   scientometric analysis, and clustering analysis. Through this study, we
   contribute to literature by discussing the challenges of current
   research, and, more importantly, identifying and proposing future
   research directions. The results of our survey show that further debate
   on the theory and application of BNs to SC resilience and risk
   management is a significant area of interest for both academics and
   practitioners. The applications of BNs, and their conjunction with
   machine learning algorithms to solve big data SC problems relating to
   uncertainty and risk, are also discussed. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Number = {2},
Pages = {126-140},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {This paper examines the non-linear relationship between a firm's
   inventory and sales performance. Specifically, whether there exists an
   optimal level of inventory that maximizes sales performance is
   investigated. In order to better understand the effect of supply chain
   inventories on firm performance, three types of inventories: raw
   materials, work-in-process, and finished goods are separately
   considered. Analyzing the panel data set of 272 Korean manufacturing
   firms for the period 1996 to 2012, the following conclusions based on
   regression methodology has been drawn. After controlling for previous
   inventory, we find there exists an optimal level of current inventory
   that maximizes current firm profitability. Furthermore, it is examined
   whether the external competition level is high using clustering
   analysis. We find that the effects of supply chain inventories on
   performance are influenced by the competitive intensity of an industry.
   The results suggest that while all types of inventories show the
   non-linear effects on firm performance in the highly competitive market,
   only finished goods inventory shows significant effects on firm
   performance in the low competitive market. Our study provides empirical
   supports for how each type of inventories should be managed and
   contributes to the extant literature by suggesting managerial
   implications from a supply-chain perspective perspective for practical
   engineers and technical professionals.},

Abstract = {Big data analysis has found applications in many industries due to its
   ability to turn huge amounts of data into insights for informed business
   and operational decisions. Advanced data mining techniques have been
   applied in many sectors of supply chains in the food industry. However,
   the previous work has mainly focused on the analysis of
   instrument-generated data such as those from hyperspectral imaging,
   spectroscopy, and biometric receptors. The importance of digital text
   data in the food and nutrition has only recently gained attention due to
   advancements in big data analytics. The purpose of this review is to
   provide an overview of the data sources, computational methods, and
   applications of text data in the food industry. Text mining techniques
   such as word-level analysis (e.g., frequency analysis), word association
   analysis (e.g., network analysis), and advanced techniques (e.g., text
   classification, text clustering, topic modeling, information retrieval,
   and sentiment analysis) will be discussed. Applications of text data
   analysis will be illustrated with respect to food safety and food fraud
   surveillance, dietary pattern characterization, consumer-opinion mining,
   new-product development, food knowledge discovery, food supply-chain
   management, and online food services. The goal is to provide insights

   clustering but also as link that enables to focus on resource efficiency
   challenges and setting up circular value chains. Climate change is at

   under discussion. This paper aims at analyzing circular economy and
   looking for possibilities to connect business and science so that
   innovative technologies and products are developed to increase SMEs'
   resource efficiency through clusters and cluster organizations.
   Bibliometric literature analysis technique was chosen to qualify
   circular economy, resource efficiency and clusters, as well as to detect
   the evidence that clusters can be enablers of resource efficiency and
   circular economy between SMEs; indicators are introduced to detect these
   linkages. The findings suggest that the principles of circular economy
   can be detected between companies within a cluster and resource
   efficient actions may arise from close cooperation, knowledge transfer,
   innovative solutions and competitive advantages which are imparted by
   the cluster. This study needs to be continued to implicate these
   indicators to test how close cooperation and other advantages that
   companies can obtain from belonging to a cluster can affect their
   engagement in circular economy and resource efficiency. These benefits
   can be used in further development of circular value chains within a

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {43},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In India, blood banks are owned by state hospitals, private hospitals,
   NGOs and private laboratories. The aim of this study is to improve the
   service levels of the blood supply chain by maximizing the availability
   and minimizing the wastage of blood. New configuration approaches are
   adapted from the successful methods of manufacturing sectors. In this
   retrospective cross-sectional study, whole blood (WB) demand and supply
   data between April 2015 to March 2016 has been taken. Data analytics
   tool R is used for statistical analysis. Two new configurations, namely
   a) Zonal Network and b) Pull system models have been developed to
   compare the existing blood supply chain. The performances of the
   proposed configurations have been compared with the existing system
   using suitable indicators computed using Arena simulation software12.0.
   The total shortage index (TSI) and total wastage index (TWI) are used as
   indicators of performance measures. Weights are assigned for shortage
   and wastage indices to the reconfigured models. The pull system model
   outperforms existing model and zone model by achieving zero wastage. In
   transfusion medicine, importance is given to the achievement of lesser
   percentage shortage than wastage. If the WB inventory in blood centers
   is sufficient enough and we have more than one zone for distribution,
   then we can reduce wastages level in the blood supply chain.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Cash is considered the most critical resource in construction projects.
   However, many contractors fail to obtain adequate liquidity due to a
   lack of proper cash flow management. Therefore, numerous research
   studies have been conducted to address cash flow-related issues in the
   construction industry. However, the literature still lacks a
   comprehensive review of cash flow management, methods and topics, in the
   construction industry. This study contributes by providing a holistic,
   up-to-date, and thorough review of 172 journal articles on construction
   cash flow. To achieve this primary objective, the study applies a mixed
   review methodology using scientometric and systematic reviews. The
   scientometric analysis provides the most contributing scholars, the
   timeline of cash flow research attention, and keywords clustering. On
   the other hand, the systematic analysis categorizes the cash flow
   themes, identifies current literature gaps, and highlights future
   research areas in the cash flow domain. The results show that cash flow
   analysis gained more research attention in the last two decades, cash
   flow-based schedule is the most frequent topic in the literature, and
   optimization techniques are predominant in the literature. Consequently,
   the study highlights five potential research frontiers. Further, an
   automated payment framework for modular construction projects using
   Blockchain-based smart contracts is developed to address some of the
   literature limitations. This study provides a guideline for future
   research efforts and raises researchers' awareness of the latest trends
   and methods of construction cash flow analysis.},

Abstract = {The three-pillar concept of environmental, economic, and social
   sustainability is widely known in academia. Research on sustainable
   development has noted its complex nature, also reflected in the
   decision-making process, which requires structuration and
   systematization. To support decision making for sustainable development,
   many multi-criteria techniques, both isolated or integrated, have been
   used. Among them, the analytic hierarchy process stands out as the most
   often used. This study conducts a systematic literature review on the
   analytic hierarchy process's support for decision making for sustainable
   development, making it possible to identify gaps and future research
   pathways. To do so, it gathers, maps, analyzes, and summarizes the
   academic literature by reviewing 173 manuscripts published between 2014
   and 2018, which are indexed by the Web of Science, Scopus, and Science
   Direct databases. The results, analysis, and discussion of the screened
   manuscripts are comprised of (a) a descriptive analysis, (b) mental
   mapping, (c) bibliometric data, (d) an in-depth analysis of the most
   cited literature, (e) an in-depth analysis of the most recently cited
   literature, and (f) the clustering of research evolution. The findings
   substantially elucidate the advancements in the state-of-the-art of the

Pages = {1683-1704},
Abstract = {Purpose Through examining the two constructs of inter-organizational
   complementarity and inter-organizational compatibility in supply chains,
   the purpose of this paper is to develop a taxonomy of focal firms'
   inter-organizational fit (IOF) configurations with their suppliers and
   customers, and examine the relationship between these configurations and
   environmental innovation (EI) in order to answer the question of with
   whom to collaborate for EI development.
   Design/methodology/approach A survey instrument was elaborated and data
   from a sample of 171 US firms were collected. The authors adopted
   cluster analysis to identify the IOF taxonomy. Canonical discriminant
   analysis was employed to uncover underlying dimensions between
   clustering variables and cluster membership. Then, ANOVA tests were
   conducted to investigate relationships between IOF configurations in the
   context of EI in supply chains.
   Findings Three configurations were identified based on the
   complementarity and compatibility between focal firms and their supply
   chain partners. It is observed that the overall IOF level is positively
   related to firms' EI outcomes. Moreover, inter-organizational
   complementarity facilitates incremental EI while inter-organizational
   compatibility plays a more crucial role in radical EI. Both are required
   to achieve the best innovation outcome.
   Originality/value This research develops the first taxonomy for
   depicting IOF in a supply chain innovation context and also clarifies
   different rationale behind the development of incremental and radical EI
   through examining distinctive effects of the complementarity and
   compatibility with supply chain partners.},

Volume = {8},
Abstract = {Delphi is a scientific method to organize and structure an expert
   discussion aiming to generate insights on controversial topics with
   limited information. The technique has seen a rise in publication
   frequency in various disciplines, especially over the past decades. In
   April 2021, the term Delphi method yielded 28,200 search hits in Google
   Scholar for the past five years alone. Given the increasing level of
   uncertainty caused by rapid technological and social change around the
   globe, collective expert opinions and assessments are likely to gain
   even more importance. Therefore, the paper at hand presents technical
   recommendations derived from a Delphi study that was conducted amid the
   outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
   The paper comprehensively demonstrates how to prepare, conduct, and
   analyze a Delphi study. In this regard, it combines several
   methodological advancements of the recent past (e.g., dissent analyses,
   scenario analyses) with state-of-the-art impulses from other disciplines
   like strategic management (e.g., fuzzy clustering), psychology (e.g.,

Abstract = {Purpose The findings of this paper throw light on the focal research
   areas within RFID in the supply chain, which serves as an effective
   guideline for future research in this area. This research, therefore,
   contributes to filling the gap by carrying out an SLR of contemporary
   research studies in the area of RFID applications in supply chains. To
   date, SLR augmented with BA has not been used to study the developments
   in RFID applications in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach We
   analyze 556 articles from years 2001 to date using Systematic Literature
   Review (SLR). Contemporary bibliometric analysis (BA) tools are
   utilized. First, an exploratory analysis is carried, out revealing
   influential authors, sources, regions, among other key aspects. Second,
   a co-citation work analysis is utilized to understand the conceptual
   structure of the literature, followed by a dynamic co-citation network
   to reveal the evolution of the field. This is followed by a multivariate
   analysis is performed on top-100 cited papers, and k-means clustering is
   carried out to find optimal groups and identify research themes. The
   influential themes are then pointed out using factor analysis. Findings
   An exploratory analysis is carried out using BA tools to provide
   insights into factors such as influential authors, production countries,
   top-cited papers and frequent keywords. Visualization of bibliographical
   data using co-citation network analysis and keyword co-occurrence
   analysis assisted in understanding the groups (communities) of research
   themes. We employed k-means clustering and factor analysis methods to
   further develop these insights. A historiographical direct citation
   analysis also unveils potential research directions. We observe that
   RFID applications in the supply chain are likely to benefit from the
   Internet of Things and blockchain Technology along with the other
   machine learning and visualization approaches. Originality/value
   Although several researchers have researched RFID literature in relation
   to supply chains, these reviews are often conducted in the traditional
   manner where the author(s) select paper based on their area of
   expertise, interest and experience. Limitation of such reviews includes
   authors' selection bias of studies to be included and limited or no use
   of advanced BA tools for analysis. This study fills this research gap by
   conducting an SLR of RFID in supply chains to identify important
   research trends in this field through the use of advanced BA tools.},

   Warehouse to Store Considering Disposal Risk},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Given the rapid diversification of products in the textile and apparel
   industry, manufacturers face significant new challenges in production.
   The life cycle of apparel products has contracted and is now, generally,
   a several-week season, during which time a majority of products are
   supposed to be sold. Products that do not sell well may be sold at a
   price lower than the fixed price, and products that do not sell at all
   within the sales period may eventually become forced disposal. This
   creates long-term management and environmental problems. In practice,
   shipping personnel determine when to ship products to stores after
   reviewing product sales information. However, they may not schedule or
   structure these shipments properly because they cannot effectively
   monitor sales for a large number of products. In this paper, shipment is
   considered to reduce the risk of product disposal on the premise of
   selling at a fixed price. Although shipment quantities are determined by
   various factors, we only consider the change in inventory at the
   logistics warehouse, since it is difficult to incorporate all factors
   into the analysis. From cluster analysis, it is found that shipping
   personnel should recognize a policy to sell products gradually over
   time. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of disposal, we forecast the
   inventory from conditional probability and are able to extract products
   out of a standard grouping using past data.},

Title = {Port sustainability and performance: A systematic literature review},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {72},
Pages = {47-64},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Motivated by a lack of research on port sustainability performance and
   assessment, this paper uses a systematic literature review to identify
   trends, measurement methods, and mechanisms for the implementation of
   strategy and policy in this area. The paper provides a comprehensive and
   critical evaluation of port operational sustainability, focusing on
   ascertaining the impact of its implementation. The study analysed and
   synthesised established characteristics in the current literature
   regarding the performance of port sustainability and its evaluation in
   terms of operations and management. Successful performance measurement
   in port sustainability is driven by the dependence on establishing
   accurate indicators as the basis for measurement. Our clustering of
   analytical sustainability indicators reveals that environmental research
   is focused on pollution, social research is mainly focused on human
   resource management, while economic research is mainly on port
   management and borderline investment. Findings are discussed in four key
   areas of port sustainability performance and assessment: existing
   trends, implementation of measures, mechanisms for implementation, and
   assessment gaps and challenges. For existing trends, attempts to
   evaluate the applicability and practicality of green operations have
   improved the awareness and promotion of governmental green policies.
   Implementation measures relate to the utilisation of techniques that
   reveal optimal practices for practical sustainable operations while
   mechanisms largely relate to establishing indicators which increase
   understanding of performance. Finally, challenges in this field include
   achieving consistency among ports in how sustainability is measured.
   Future research should incentivise improvements in port operational
   practice and encourage self-examination in order to reprioritise
   activity.},

Abstract = {Recognizing construction assets (e.g.,materials, equipment, labor) from
   point cloud data of construction environments provides essential
   information for engineering and management applications including
   progress monitoring, safety management, supply-chain management, and
   quality control. This study introduces a novel principal axes descriptor
   (PAD) for construction-equipment classification from point cloud data.
   Scattered as-is point clouds are first processed with downsampling,
   segmentation, and clustering steps to obtain individual instances of
   construction equipment. A geometric descriptor consisting of dimensional
   variation, occupancy distribution, shape profile, and plane counting
   features is then calculated to encode three-dimensional (3D)
   characteristics of each equipment category. Using the derived features,
   machine learning methods such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector
   machine are employed to determine class membership among major
   construction-equipment categories such as backhoe loader, bulldozer,
   dump truck, excavator, and front loader. Construction-equipment
   classification with the proposed PAD was validated using computer-aided
   design (CAD)-generated point clouds as training data and laser-scanned
   point clouds from an equipment yard as testing data. The recognition
   performance was further evaluated using point clouds from a construction
   site as well as a pose variation data set. PAD was shown to achieve a
   higher recall rate and lower computation time compared to competing 3D
   descriptors. The results indicate that the proposed descriptor is a
   viable solution for construction-equipment classification from point
   cloud data. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to bridge the gap in the literature
   on supply chain finance (SCF) by exploring the relationship between
   network capabilities and corporate financial performance (CFP) in
   financial supply chains (FSCs). Design/methodology/approach The authors
   collect panel data and adopt regression analysis to analyse the joint
   investment activities among 1359 manufacturing firms and 289 financial
   service providers in China to explore how network capabilities, both
   network power and network centrality, improve CFP in the FSCs. Findings
   Under the FSCs environments, network centrality (i.e. eigenvector
   centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality) raises CFP
   (ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q) and network power (node degree, clustering
   coefficient) also improves CFP. However, node strength from the network
   power stream has a negative effect on Tobin's Q, indicating that when
   the partner of a firm has an extremely strong influence in FSCs; this
   weakens the bargaining ability and flexibility of the focal firm, thus
   reducing its long-term financial performance. Practical implications The
   joint investment activities among supply chain partners and financial
   service providers help managers understand the advanced financing
   solutions generated by internal and external network organisations as
   well as be aware of network capabilities' impact on CFP in FSCs.
   Originality/value This study answers the call for more empirical
   research on SCF to provide a broader sample to examine financial supply
   chain management. This is one of the earliest studies to shed light on a
   new perspective - how network capabilities improve CFP in the FSCs.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Facility Layout Design (FLP) is an NP-Hard, which is related to the
   optimization of the arrangement of facilities in a shop floor or
   manufacturing unit to maximize the performance and minimize the
   operating cost. An efficient layout must not only consider the profit
   but also emphasize on other social causes such as energy consumption,
   pollution, and people's safety. These are referred to as the three
   pillars of sustainability. This paper identifies the criteria for
   sustainability in a manufacturing layout and presents an aggregate
   mathematical formulation for Sustainable Facility Layout Problem (SFLP).
   The paper proposes a novel 4-stage methodology using Big Data Analytics,
   Machine Learning, Hybrid Meta-heuristic, Data Envelopment Analysis
   (DEA), and K-mean clustering for designing an energy-efficient
   sustainable sub-optimal layout under uncertain (stochastic) demand over
   multiple periods. The goal of this framework is to 1) uniquely rank and
   predict an efficient SFLP that overcomes the dimensionality curse
   associated with handling large data set, 2) use K-mean to identify the
   criteria that maximally satisfied an efficient sustainable layout and
   propose an SFLP model that can be customized depending social, political
   and economic conditions, and 3) evaluate the total energy consumption
   and CO2 emission for an efficient sustainable facility layout. To show
   the running methodology a case is presented using hypothetical data from
   the literature.},

Title = {Smart industry and the pathways to HRM 4.0: implications for SCM},
Journal = {SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL},

Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to address the potential impacts of
   Industry 4.0 on human resource management (HRM) - with a particular
   focus on employment, job profile and qualification and skill
   requirements in the workforce - which can have implications for supply
   chain management (SCM). Consequently, exploratory relationships among
   Industry 4.0, HRM and SCM are presented based on a systematic review.
   Design/methodology/approach To explore Industry 4.0 literature and its
   impact on employment, the authors used a systematic literature review to
   identify, classify and analyze current knowledge, flagging trends and
   proposing recommendations for future research in this area. Using the
   Web of Science database, the authors utilized co-citation software to
   visualize the networks which emerged from recurrent terms and which were
   then used to develop the categories of analysis. Findings The authors
   can affirm that the literature in this field is in a transition process,
   from the early studies of German academics to the current development of
   new impacts worldwide. Industry 4.0 is the central theme of the
   literature analyzed and is accomplished through the development of
   employment, qualifications, skills and learning frameworks. The results
   reveal that most papers are conceptual, with quantitative studies still
   lacking. Developed countries have a leading role in terms of research
   production, while Latin America and Asia are far behind. Clustering
   reveals four dominant themes (educational changes, employment scenario,
   work infrastructure resources and work meaning and proposal). The first
   refers to labor changes around working conditions, the work environment
   and new skills which are required. The second main theme concerns the
   potentially unstable shift in the labor market has toward a high-level
   context. The third is about the technical interface of humans and
   machines, and finally, the fourth understands the German industry as a
   starting point for global industrial improvements and work proposal
   changes. Furthermore, socio-technical systems cover the implications of
   HRM for SCM in three different dimensions: qualification and education
   (human competences), collaboration and integration of SCM
   (organizational competences) and data and information management
   (technical competences).
   Research limitations/implications - An original research agenda for
   further development of the topic. Additionally, the implications of the
   findings for SCM practitioners are presented.
   Practical implications - SCM managers can benefit from the results of
   this paper by developing adjusted polices for organizational and human
   aspects. Specially about training programs to improve technology skills
   and education programs for cyber-human new plataforms.
   Originality/value - So far, Industry 4.0, HRM- related topics and
   implications for SCM have generally been considered separately. This
   paper elucidates the few important studies on the impacts of Industry
   4.0 on human-related topics, such as the labor market, building a
   research framework using the main contributions highlighted in the
   literature. An original research agenda is presented, as well as
   potential implications for SCM.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In past recent years, by increasing in the considerations on the
   significance of data science many studies have been developed concerning
   the big data structured problems. Along with the information science, in
   the field of decision science, multi-attribute decision-making (MADM)
   approaches have been considerably applied in research studies. One of
   the most important procedures in supply chain management is selecting
   the optimal supplier to maintain the long-term productivity of the
   supply chain. There has been a vast amount of research which utilized
   MADM approaches to tackle the supplier selection problems, but only a
   few of these research considered big data structured problems. The
   current study presents a comprehensive novel approach for improving
   Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based on cluster analysis
   considering crisp big data structure input which is called CLUS-MCDA
   (Cluster analysis for improving Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis)
   algorithm. The proposed method is based on consolidating a data mining
   technique i.e. k-means clustering method and a MADM approach which is
   MULTIMOORA method. CLUS-MCDA method is a fast and practical approach
   which has been developed in this research which is implied in a supplier
   selection problem considering crisp big data structured input. A
   real-world case study in MAMUT multi-national corporation has been
   presented to show the validity and practicality of the CLUS-MCDA
   approach which calculated considering the business areas and criteria

Journal = {MANAGEMENT DECISION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1891-1910},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to examine logistics infrastructure, trade
   differences, and environmental and social equity factors, for a set of
   89 countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - Following recent work which uses secondary
   data sources for supply chain research at the country-level, data were
   obtained from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund databases.
   Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to compute country-level
   efficiencies and ANOVA was used to do regional comparisons.
   Findings - The analysis shed light on country-level dimensions of
   logistics infrastructure and trade performance. It also provided
   insights regarding environmental (e.g. CO2 emissions) and social equity
   (e.g. health expenditure) dimensions for different regions.
   Research limitations/implications - Panel data rather than longitudinal
   data were used to draw the conclusions. A more exhaustive study could
   consider a multi-year timeframe. A limited number of dimensions were
   examined. As the study was exploratory, further work could consider a
   more extensive number of dimensions.
   Practical implications - The study has important implications for policy
   makers, since the attractiveness of various resource endowments like
   those considered here (environmental, social, supply chain logistics)
   can be seen to be associated with trade performance.
   Originality/value - This is one of the few studies to explore efficiency
   differences (enacted through DEA and ANOVA analyses), differentiating
   the research from the usual country clustering approaches. It also
   contributes to the understanding of differences between countries from a
   macro perspective, which provides insights for firms intending to expand

   businesses employ multichannel services (e.g. offering online and
   offline services). With multichannel services, any inconsistency in
   perceived quality across channels may result in customer distrust toward
   a service provider. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
   effect of inconsistent quality on the association between e-service
   quality and customer relationships in a university context.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study conducted a web survey and 318
   respondents who have both physical and e-service experiences were
   collected. The inconsistent quality across channels was divided into
   three groups by k-means clustering approach. Next, the hypothesized
   associations were analyzed using regression analysis based on three
   groups.
   Findings - The results show that inconsistent quality has different
   impacts on the association between e-service quality and customer
   relationships across the three groups. Especially in the positive
   disconfirmation group, the investment in e-services will be in vain
   because certain e-service sub-constructs lose their impact on customer
   relationships.
   Practical implications - The findings of this study provide implications
   for improving customer relationships under different cross-channel
   quality inconsistency conditions for managers.
   Originality/value - This study extends the concept of expectancy
   disconfirmation theory to the multichannel service context and pioneers
   the exploration of the moderating effect of cross-channel quality
   inconsistency in customer relationships, contributing to the
   understanding of the literature about the impacts of inconsistent
   quality on customer relationships.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence in retail - a systematic literature review},
Journal = {FORESIGHT},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to present a systematic literature
   review of academic peer-reviewed articles in English published between
   2005 and 2021. The articles were reviewed based on the following
   features: research topic, conceptual and theoretical characterization,
   artificial intelligence (AI) methods and techniques.
   Design/methodology/approach This study examines the extent to which AI
   features within academic research in retail industry and aims to
   consolidate existing knowledge, analyse the development on this topic,
   clarify key trends and highlight gaps in the scientific literature
   concerning the role of AI in retail. Findings The findings of this study
   indicate an increase in AI literature within the field of retailing in
   the past five years. However, this research field is fairly fragmented
   in scope and limited in methodologies, and it has several gaps. On the
   basis of a structured topic allocation, a total of eight priority topics
   were identified and highlighted that (1) optimizing the retail value
   chain and (2) improving customer expectations with the help of AI are
   key topics in published research in this field. Research
   limitations/implications This study is based on academic peer-reviewed
   articles published before July 2021; hence, scientific outputs published
   after the moment of writing have not been included. Originality/value
   This study contributes to the in-depth and systematic exploration of the
   extent to which retail scholars are aware of and working on AI. To the
   best of the author's knowledge, this study is the first systematic
   literature review within retailing research dealing with AI technology.},

Title = {A systematic review on green human resource management: Implications for

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {247},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {This article identifies current progressions and research gaps in Green
   Human Resource Management literature and investigates the future of
   green practices in meeting the social sustainability requirements of an
   organisation. Considering the growing awareness on greening and
   sustainability, a systematic review of the domain specific literature
   was carried out using the Scopus and Google Scholar databases which
   resulted in a set of 174 scientific articles between 1995 and 2019.
   NVivo Plus software version 12 was used for quantitative processing as
   well as qualitative analysis of data. Content coding and cluster
   analysis were performed, the results of which exhibited three clusters
   namely, green human resource management practices, employee green
   behaviour at workplace and organisational sustainability. Further manual
   analysis revealed social sustainability to be the least explored area
   than economic and environmental pillars of sustainability. From this,
   the authors conceptually explored a theoretical model suggesting the
   mediational role of `employee green behaviour at workplace' in the
   relationship between `green human resource management practices' and
   `social sustainability' of organisations using grounded theory approach.
   Therefore, prioritising social equity, health, wellness and well-being,
   this work examines the state-of-the-art in green human resource
   management research to unravel the enormous potential of core green
   practices envisioning social sustainability, which has not been
   established till date. Based on the content coding, clustering, and
   further analysis, propositions, future paths and implications are also
   presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Review of green development of Chinese industrial parks},
Journal = {ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {China has posed great importance on green development, a model for
   economic transformation that enhances public welfare while sustaining
   environment and resources. Meanwhile, China has the largest number of
   industrial parks which is crucial for both the global supply chain and
   national economy. Diversified green development demonstration programs
   have been promoted with a top-down paradigm facilitated by the central
   government due to the parks' important roles in industrial development
   and pollution control. There is a growing knowledge body about the green
   development of the parks, and Chinese cases accounted for the largest
   share of peer-reviewed publications. This article provides a review of
   academic papers and grey documents on the topic since 2000 by
   descriptive and bibliometric analysis. We extract five major research
   focuses by keyword clustering of 129 peer-reviewed articles, namely, the
   planning of eco-industrial parks, the improvement of environmental
   management, the evolution of industrial symbiosis and supply chain
   networks, the optimization of infrastructure, and the assessment of
   economic-environmental performance. Then, diversified practices of green
   development in Chinese industrial parks are further enriched by
   supplementing grey literature and practice. Based on the literature and
   ongoing practice, we explain the green development model for Chinese IPs
   and conclude inadequate dissemination of concept and knowledge,
   heterogeneity of interest, untargeted assessment and guidance, and
   backward management system are the five major challenges in the field.
   The review can inspire the scientific community, policymakers, and
   practitioners in China and other developing countries to further promote
   green development by targeting industrial parks.},

Title = {Fostering reverse logistics in India by prominent barrier identi fi

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {294},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Reverse Logistics (RL) is becoming a critical strategic differentiator
   among organisations and business entities for a sustainable environment,
   value creation, and promoting a Circular Economy (CE). Hence, this topic
   is relevant in the current Indian context. This paper explores the RL
   practices that drive operational efficiency while promoting cleaner
   production. This study aims to identify the barriers to RL
   implementation and bring together a practical approach to overcome all
   the relevant barriers in the RL sector in the Indian context. The survey
   of previous literature suggests that researchers have tried to
   prioritise barriers to RL implementation. However, this paper intends to
   analyse the barriers from a CE perspective and propose a framework for
   developing strategies with a structured implementation for managers in
   India's RL industry. Effects of these barriers have been analysed, while
   concurrently developing strategies to mitigate them and gauge the impact
   of strategies on the system of barriers using an evaluation model
   developed by incorporating quantitative techniques-grey-DEMATEL
   (Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory), agglomerative
   hierarchical clustering, fuzzy measure and fuzzy integral. The study
   aims to serve as a guiding framework for decision-makers to identify the
   barriers in their organisations and map the barriers to contemporary
   strategies to tackle them. The insights from the analysis show
   difficulty in managing quality of circular goods as the prominent
   barrier followed by a lack of responsibility and initiation by top
   management. Key strategies identified to mitigate the barriers are
   classified into priority, long-term, contingency, and non-priority
   zones. Consumer education, proper logistics network utilisation and
   efficient warehousing are key strategies that companies should adopt on
   a priority basis. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A systematic literature review of supply chain decision making supported
   by the Internet of Things and Big Data Analytics},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {154},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The willingness to invest in Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data
   Analytics (BDA) seems not to depend on supply nor demand of
   technological innovations. The required sensing and communication
   technologies have already matured and became affordable for most
   organizations. Businesses on the other hand require more operational
   data to address the dynamic and stochastic nature of supply chains. So
   why should we wait for the actual implementation of tracking and
   monitoring devices within the supply chain itself? This paper provides
   an objective overview of state-of-the-art IoT developments in today's
   supply chain and logistics research. The main aim is to find examples of
   academic literature that explain how organizations can incorporate
   real-time data of physically operating objects into their decision
   making. A systematic literature review is conducted to gain insight into
   the IoT's analytical capabilities, resulting into a list of 79
   cross-disciplinary publications. Most researchers integrate the newly
   developed measuring devices with more traditional ICT infrastructures to
   either visualize the current way of operating, or to better predict the
   system's future state. The resulting health/condition monitoring systems
   seem to benefit production environments in terms of dependability and
   quality, while logistics operations are becoming more flexible and
   faster due to the stronger emphasis on prescriptive analytics (e.g.,
   association and clustering). Further research should extend the IoT's
   perception layer with more context-aware devices to promote autonomous
   decision making, invest in wireless communication networks to stimulate
   distributed data processing, bridge the gap in between predictive and
   prescriptive analytics by enriching the spectrum of pattern recognition
   models used, and validate the benefits of the monitoring systems
   developed.},

Title = {A complex network approach to supply chain network theory},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS \& PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {442-469},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance supply chain network
   theory by applying theoretical and empirical developments in complex
   network literature to the context of supply chains as complex adaptive
   systems. The authors synthesize these advancements to gain an
   understanding of the network properties underlying efficient supply
   chains. To develop a suitable theory of supply chain networks, the
   authors look to mirror the properties of complex network models with
   real-world supply chains.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors review complex network
   literature drawn from multiple disciplines in top scientific journals.
   From this interdisciplinary review a series of propositions are
   developed around supply chain complexity and adaptive phenomena.
   Findings - This paper proposes that the structure of efficient supply
   chains follows a ``scale-free{''} network. This proposal emerges from
   arguments that the key properties of efficient supply chains are a short
   characteristic path length, a high clustering coefficient and a power
   law connectivity distribution.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors' discussion centres on
   applying advances found in recent complex network literature. Hence, the
   need is noted to empirically validate the series of propositions
   developed in this paper in a supply chain context.
   Practical implications - If efficient supply chains resemble a
   scale-free network, then managers can derive a number of implications.
   For example, supply chain resilience is derived by the presence of hub
   firms. To reduce the vulnerability of supply chains to cascading
   failures, it is recognized that managers could build in redundancy,
   undertake a multi-sourcing strategy or intermediation between hub firms.
   Originality/value - This paper advances supply chain network theory. It
   offers a novel understanding of supply chains as complex adaptive
   systems and, in particular, that efficient and resilient supply chain
   systems resemble a scale-free network. In addition, it provides a series
   of propositions that allow modelling and empirical research to proceed.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the business environment is characterized by great uncertainty
   and variability. In this environment, information technology (IT) has
   proved to be an important strategic ingredient for the creation of
   competitive advantage. This role of IT has been widely accepted during
   the past few years {[}Feeny D. Creating and sustaining competitive
   advantage with IT. In: Earl M, editor. Information management the

   Methodist University Case Study \#SMY/MIS/90-01, Edwin L. Cox School of
   Business, Dallas, TX, January 1990].
   In the new era of production, strategic priorities rather than a cost
   contained focus have proved to be important for competition, namely:
   quality, dependability, flexibility, customer service, after sale
   service, supply chain management, etc. IT proved to be vital for
   successful competition as it can facilitate the attainment of these
   strategic targets.
   In this paper, the impact of IT on financial performance for the
   different types and levels of business strategy is examined. After the
   clustering of firms according to their strategic priorities, the effect
   of IT on financial performance is estimated. To do this a
   cross-sectional study was held in the field of Greek manufacturing firms
   that apply advanced IT, in order to explore which, how and in what level
   manufacturing priorities have been adopted. For that purpose, cluster
   analysis and VACOR algorithm were used, to distinguish clusters of firms
   and estimate the effect of IT on financial performance, for each type
   and level of strategic choice. Return on invested capital (ROIC) has
   been used as a criterion of performance in order to incorporate the
   effect of cost, revenues and profits. It was found that the effect of IT
   on financial performance was observed to be greater for firms which
   emphasize the higher level of flexibility strategy and the middle level
   of cost strategy. On the contrary, the effect of IT on performance, was
   observed to be greater for firms which emphasize a lower level of
   quality and innovation strategy. Further discussion of these results and
   conclusions were drawn. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {SCIENTOMETRICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Number = {8},
Pages = {6785-6801},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The primary goal of this article is to identify the research fronts on
   the application of data-driven methods in business and economics. For
   this purpose, the research literature of the business and economic
   sciences Subject Categories from the Web of Science is mapped using
   BibExcel and VOSviewer. Since the assignment to subject categories is
   done at the journal level and since a journal is often assigned to
   several subject categories in Web of Science, two mappings are
   performed: one without considering multiple assignments (broad view) and
   one considering only those (articles from) journals that have been
   assigned exclusively to the business and economic sciences subject
   categories and no others (narrow view). A further aim of this article is
   therefore to identify differences in the two mappings. Surprisingly,
   engineering sciences play a major role in the broad mapping, in addition
   to the economic sciences. In the narrow mapping, however, only the
   following clusters with a clear business-management focus emerge: (i)
   Data-driven methods in management in general and data-driven supply
   chain management in particular, (ii) Data-driven operations research
   analyses with different business administration/management focuses,
   (iii) Data-driven methods and processes in economics and finance, and
   (iv) Data-driven methods in Information Systems. One limitation of the
   narrow mapping is that many relevant documents are not covered since the
   journals in which they appear are assigned to multiple subject
   categories in WoS. The paper comes to the conclusion that the multiple
   assignments of subject categories in Web of Science may lead to massive
   changes in the results. Adjacent subject areas-in this specific case the
   application of data-driven methods in engineering and more
   mathematically oriented contributions in economics (econometrics) are
   considered in the broad mapping (not excluding subject categories from
   neighbouring disciplines) and are even over-represented compared to the
   core areas of business and economics. If a mapping should only consider
   the core aspects of particular research fields, it is shown in this use
   case that the exclusion of Web of Science-subject categories that do not
   belong to the core areas due to multiple assignments (narrow view), may
   be a valuable alternative. Finally, it depends on the reader to decide
   which mapping is more beneficial to them.},

Title = {The role and attributes of manufacturing companies in virtual supply
   chains},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {511-532},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the role and main
   attributes of manufacturing companies which operate in virtual supply
   chains.
   Design/methodology/approach - In order to identify the role and main
   attributes of manufacturing companies enabling to operate in a virtual
   supply chain, a three-step statistical analysis was employed, namely
   exploratory factor analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and
   non-hierarchical clustering technique.
   Findings - The findings show that virtual supply chain operations would
   not be supported by manufacturing companies offering highly customized
   products achieved by a unit production, developed in details and
   engineered to order. On the contrary, the large manufacturing companies
   of virtual supply chains report a high level of flexibility stemming
   from a wide scope of more standardized products offered to the market.
   The conducted study show that better ability of manufacturers supporting
   virtual supply chains is not industry specific.
   Research limitations/implications - The list of investigated attributes
   is not complete, and other characteristics of manufacturers in virtual
   supply chains should be identified. Another important shortcoming of the
   study is its quantitative character and generalization of the findings.
   Each ``virtual{''} environment in supply chains may be unique and some
   of the compared characteristics may differ significantly. Therefore, the
   aforementioned attributes should be considered separately with a
   conscious focus on the environmental context. The quantitative study may
   be greatly enhanced by applying the case study approach, showing
   detailed solutions and practices, and thus making the study more
   valuable from the theoretical and managerial standpoints.
   Practical implications - The conducted study showed that better ability
   of manufacturers to support virtual supply chains is not industry
   specific, since the branch of electronic products and electrical
   equipment and components was represented by an equal share of
   manufacturers, both in non-virtual and virtual clusters. Furthermore, in
   order to operate in virtual supply chains, managers should pay attention
   to the structure and range of products delivered to the market. The
   managers should also be aware that apart from considering cost and
   efficiency, operating in a virtual supply chain environment also
   requires quality of products and processes in order to manufacture and
   deliver a superior value for the customers.
   Originality/value - Having recognized major groups of indicators
   demonstrating the level of ability of manufacturing companies to operate
   in a virtual supply chain, the attributes of three clusters of
   manufacturers possessing different bunch of features, significant for
   virtual supply chains, have been distinguished.},

   community was foreseen, researching new algorithms or knowledge hubs to
   achieve green scheduling. Green scheduling may be considered one of the
   principles of green manufacturing, aimed at minimizing environmental
   damage and energy waste. A review of the literature shows that there are
   no research works that analyze the scientific development carried out in
   ``green scheduling{''} through methodologies based on bibliometric
   analysis, thus the need and the novelty of this research. Based on a
   dataset formed by 420 scientific documents published from 2006 to 2020 a
   bibliometric and network analysis is carried out to find the scientific
   trends, the main relationships according to collaborations and
   intermediaries, and the research hubs that help to establish the
   research agenda. The results show that ``green scheduling{''} is a
   growing research area in the scientific community and in recent years
   the number of new research topics has experienced considerable growth.
   This research is developed in Asia, Europe and America, but China stands
   out as the most productive, collaborative, intermediary, influential and
   active country at present, through its organizations which are mainly
   universities, such as Huanzhong University of Science and Technology and
   Tongji University. However, research development related to green
   scheduling is carried out in a collaborative environment between
   institutions located in different countries, allowing countries that are
   not scientific powerhouses to develop research in the area. The network
   analysis makes it possible to define the research framework through the
   clustering of the dataset's research keywords, highlighting that the
   main areas of research focus on the development of new methods through
   algorithms aimed at improving energy efficiency in production
   environments, in areas of computational development such as cloud
   computing, and in transportation. The most cited research papers,
   considered the main drivers of knowledge, are published in high-quality
   research journals, and are mainly developments in scheduling algorithms
   for different work environments with a green approach. Research findings
   can provide the academic community with relevant information about green
   scheduling to make appropriate decisions and become a research agenda
   for future research.},

Abstract = {The emergence of online retailers has brought new opportunities to the
   design of their distribution networks. Notably, for online retailers
   that do not operate offline stores, their target customers are more
   sensitive to the quality of logistic services, such as delivery speed
   and reliability. This paper is motivated by a leading online retailer
   for cosmetic products on Taobao.com that aimed to improve its logistics
   efficiency by redesigning its centralized distribution network into a
   multilevel one. The multilevel distribution network consists of a layer
   of primary facilities to hold stocks from suppliers and transshipment
   and a layer of secondary facilities to provide last-mile delivery. There
   are two major challenges of designing such a facility network. First,
   online customers can respond signifi-cantly to the change of logistics
   efficiency with the redesigned network, thereby rendering the network
   optimized under the original demand distribution suboptimal. Second,
   because online retailers have relatively small sales volumes and are
   very flexible in choosing facility locations, the facility candidate set
   can be large, causing the facility location optimization challenging to
   solve. To this end, we propose an iterative prediction-and-optimization
   strategy for distribution network design. Specifically, we first develop
   an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict customer demands,
   factoring in the logistic service quality given the network and the
   city-level purchasing power based on demographic statistics. Then, a
   mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to choose
   facility locations with minimum transportation, facility setup, and
   package processing costs. We further develop an efficient two-stage
   heuristic for computing high-quality solutions to the MILP model,
   featuring an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm and an
   expectation and maximization algorithm. Subsequently, the ANN demand
   predictor and two-stage heuristic are integrated for iterative network
   design. Finally, using a real-world data set, we validate the demand
   prediction accuracy and demonstrate the mutual interdependence between
   the demand and network design.
   Summary of Contribution: We propose an iterative
   prediction-and-optimization algorithm for multilevel distribution
   network design for e-logistics and evaluate its operational value for
   online retailers. We address the issue of the interplay between
   distribution network design and the demand distribution using an
   iterative framework. Further, combining the idea in operational research
   and data mining, our paper provides an end-to-end solution that can
   provide accurate predictions of online sales distribution, subsequently
   solving large-scale optimization problems for distribution network
   design problems.},

Title = {Sustainable manufacturing practices in Malaysian palm oil mills Priority
   and current performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {278-298},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the implementation
   of sustainable manufacturing practices in Malaysian palm oil mills
   (POMs) by comparing the status of their current achievements and the
   levels of priority placed on their practices.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was used to collect
   data about 20 sustainable manufacturing practices from 51 POMs located
   in Malaysia. A five-point Likert scale was considered for recording
   variations in priorities and current practices with regard to
   sustainable manufacturing. A Cronbach's a reliability test and a
   binomial test were undertaken to assess the internal consistency and the
   validity of the survey data. Spearman's. correlation analysis was
   employed to determine the linear correlation between each of the
   sustainability practices identified. Factor analysis was conducted to
   reduce the number of sustainable manufacturing practices based on factor
   loading and to derive a clustering of these factors.
   Findings - The results showed that employees' well-being has the highest
   level in terms of both priority and current achievement. However, for
   other sustainable manufacturing practices, there was a difference where
   the current achievement of these practices in the Malaysian POMs was
   seen to be slightly lower than the priority given to them. Strong
   correlation of significant value was observed between the minimization
   of production waste and pollution prevention practices. From factor
   analysis, 15 practices of high factor loading were grouped into a
   proactive sustainability strategy and a preventive sustainability
   strategy.
   Research limitations/implications - The study was still relatively
   exploratory. Future studies could investigate the barriers to the
   implementation of sustainable manufacturing practices at Malaysian POMs.
   The sample, which consisted of 51 Malaysian POMs, represented an
   important sector of the Malaysian economy. Reliance on stated, rather
   than revealed, preferences may limit the implications of the analysis
   undertaken for this study, but it does represent a major step forward in
   understanding the past in what was a highly recommended sector for
   investigation due to the paucity of extant data. A more broadly based,
   random sample of POMs from other countries would provide a better
   understanding of issues related to sustainable manufacturing practices.
   Practical implications - The results of this study can be used by
   practitioners to adjust the sustainable manufacturing practices
   currently applied and further studies may go on to examine the reasons
   and implications for discrepancies between priorities and desired
   sustainability goals in more detail.
   Originality/value - The survey conducted about sustainable manufacturing
   practices amongst Malaysian POMs was focussed on the three dimensions of
   sustainability, namely, the economic, environmental, and social elements
   involved.},
