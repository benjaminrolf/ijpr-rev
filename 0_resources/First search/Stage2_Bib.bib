 abstract = {The purpose of this study is twofold. First, to explore and classify factors influencing traceability implementation, and second, to cluster essential traceability-related information that demands recording and sharing with businesses and customers, in the context of the textile and clothing supply chain. A Delphi study is conducted with 23 experts (including research practitioners and industry experts) to explore, validate, and classify traceability factors and related information using distribution analyses and hierarchal clustering. As a result, 14 factors and 19 information sets are identified and classified with a moderately high agreement among the experts. Among these, risk management, product authentication, and visibility are the highest ranked and the most important factors influencing traceability implementation in the textile and clothing supply chain. While origin, composition, and sustainability-related information are crucial for sharing with customers, the information vital to businesses includes manufacturer/supplier details, product specifications, and composition. It is noteworthy that this research is among the few that classifies traceability factors and information through expert perspectives, and it creates decisive knowledge of traceability for the textile and clothing supply chain. It further provides insights on the extent to which this information can be shared among supply chain actors. Outcomes of this study can be helpful for the development of an information traceability framework. Policymakers can use the results to draft traceability guidelines/regulations, whilst top management can develop traceability-related strategies. © 2019 by the authors.},

 abstract = {The literature suggests a growing interest in the application of network analysis in supply chain management. However this has been at the organizational rather than the process level. We believe there is value in applying such analysis to internal processes in supply chain networks. This study uses network analysis techniques to investigate the Stewart [8] framework for excellence in supply chains which considers the impact of delivery performance, flexibility and responsiveness, logistics cost and assets management. We analyze traditional process flow charts as a network in which nodes represent processes, and links between processes have values associated with dimensions of excellence. The supply chain is analyzed and viewed using measures of centrality and clustering related to the dimensions of excellence, and compared with traditional perceptions of the same processes which are more related to time criticality. Overall, the study indicates that traditional means of managing supply chains are not only unfocused in terms of excellence, but are compromised through inability to recognize the importance of various process groups, with a serious mismatch of resourcing as a result. The study provides early findings supporting the future development of a methodology to better manage supply chains using network analysis, in particular to better prioritize resources on critical processes. © 2011 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Since customer attention is increasing due to growing customer health awareness, it is important for the perishable food supply chain to monitor food quality and safety. This study proposes a real-time monitoring system that utilizes smartphone-based sensors and a big data platform. Firstly, we develop a smartphone-based sensor to gather temperature, humidity, GPS, and image data. The IoT-generated sensor on the smartphone has characteristics such as a large amount of storage, an unstructured format, and continuous data generation. Thus, in this study, we propose an effective big data platform design to handle IoT-generated sensor data. Furthermore, the abnormal sensor data generated by failed sensors is called outliers and may arise in real cases. The proposed system utilizes outlier detection based on statistical and clustering approaches to filter out the outlier data. The proposed system was evaluated for system and gateway performance and tested on the kimchi supply chain in Korea. The results showed that the proposed system is capable of processing a massive input/output of sensor data efficiently when the number of sensors and clients increases. The current commercial smartphones are sufficiently capable of combining their normal operations with simultaneous performance as gateways for transmitting sensor data to the server. In addition, the outlier detection based on the 3-sigma and DBSCAN were used to successfully detect/classify outlier data as separate from normal sensor data. This study is expected to help those who are responsible for developing the real-time monitoring system and implementing critical strategies related to the perishable supply chain. © 2017 by the authors.},

 abstract = {In modern systems, there is a tendency to model issues more accurately with low computational cost and considering multiscale decision-making which increases the complexity of the optimization. Therefore, it is necessary to develop tools to cope with these new challenges. Supply chain management of enterprise-wide operations usually involves three decision levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. These decision levels depend on each other involving different time scales. Accordingly, their integration usually leads to multiscale models that are computationally intractable. In this work, the aim is to develop novel clustering methods with multiple attributes to tackle the integrated problem. As a result, a clustering structure is proposed in the form of a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) later converted into a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for clustering shape-based time series data with multiple attributes through a multi-objective optimization approach (since different attributes have different scales or units) and minimize the computational complexity of multiscale decision problems. The results show that normal clustering is closer to the optimal case (full-scale model) compared with sequence clustering. Additionally, it provides improved solution quality due to flexibility in terms of sequence restrictions. The developed clustering algorithms can work with any two-dimensional datasets and simultaneous demand patterns. The most suitable applications of the clustering algorithms are long-term planning and integrated scheduling and planning problems. To show the performance of the proposed method, it is investigated on an energy hub as a case study, the results show a significant reduction in computational cost with accuracies ranging from 95.8% to 98.3%. © 2021 by the authors.

 abstract = {Planning for optimized farming with the aim of providing ideal site and cultivar selection is critical for a stable and sustainable supply of rice with sufficient quantity and quality to customers. In this study, a range of morphological characteristics and yield of eight rice cultivars that are commonly cultivated in Korea were investigated from 2005 to 2020. All morphological characteristics were significantly different among the eight rice cultivars. The dataset of morphological characteristics and yield was used to isolate groups of similar rice cultivars. The k-means clustering method was used to group the rice cultivars. Three groups (Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3) were created. Most cultivars were in Group 1. High-yielding rice cultivars were in Group 2, while the rice cultivars in Group 3 had the lowest rice grain yield. After grouping these rice cultivars, ideal farming locations for all three rice cultivar groups were identified to reduce transportation cost using an optimized location–allocation model. Simulation results suggested the following: (1) Group 1 should be produced in Jellanam-do (south west region), (2) Group 2 should be produced in Chungcheongnam-do (central west region), and (3) Group 3 should be mainly produced in the central west region of South Korea. Simulation results showed the potential to reduce transportation cost by around 0.014%. This can also reduce 21.04 tons of CO2 emission from a freight truck. Because these eight cultivars only make up 19.76% of the total rice production in South Korea, the cost reduction proportion was only 0.014% of total revenue. In future studies, more rice cultivars should be investigated to increase the efficiency of the model performance. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

 abstract = {When dealing with Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (ASRS), the allocation of items to the most convenient storage location depends on the vast amount of data produced internally (e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning, Manufacturing Enterprise Systems) and externally (e.g. Supply Chain Management). Moreover, a proper item allocation in the warehouse has a strong influence on the warehouse saturation levels and picking times. In this perspective, the present work proposes the application of data-driven algorithms for managing items in an Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) in order to reduce the picking times and storage space. Specifically, a four-layer framework is adopted for collecting data produced by different information sources and analyzing them through a data-driven approach. The analytics layer is performed by combining the Association Rule Mining (ARM) technique, to investigate the network of influences among data collected, and a simulation approach for assessing the feasibility of the proposed implementation. The Association Rule Mining allows company managers to identify the components that should be located on the same tray in the ASRS, defining the couples of items frequently picked together in order to reduce the total picking time. The proposed approach is applied to the case study of a shoe manufacturing company to explain the research approach and show how the implementation of the data-driven methodology can provide valuable support in defining item allocation and picking rules. The proposed Association Rule Mining method is new in this context and it has shown a positive impact in comparison to traditional solutions of warehouse management, providing a complete overview of the items’ interactions and identifying communities of items that define local and global patterns and locate influential entities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Initially, the association rules are mined from EMA-based healthcare inventory data. After that, SC cost-impact rules are chosen for every SC member using GSA. The obtained SC cost-impact rules will possibly signify the future state of inventory in any SC member. Furthermore, the level of holding or reducing the inventory can be determined from the SC cost-impact rules. Thus, the SC cost-impact rules that are derived using the proposed method greatly facilitate optimal inventory control and hence make the supply chain management more effective.

 abstract = {Vendor selection is a strategic issue in supply-chain management for any organization to identify the right supplier. Such selection in most cases is based on the analysis of some specific criteria. Most of the researches so far concentrate on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis. However, it incurs a huge computational complexity when a large number of suppliers are considered. So, data mining approaches would be required to convert raw data into useful information and knowledge. Hence, a new hybrid model of MCDM and data mining approaches was proposed in this research to address the supplier selection problem. In this paper, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering as a data mining model has been used to cluster suppliers into groups. Then, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE) method has been employed to rank the suppliers. The efficiency of this method was revealed by conducting a case study in an automotive industry. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

 abstract = {Radio frequencies refer to the electromagnetic energy that we transmit the identification information from tags to its reader. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) transmits the data without line of sight. RFID tags are small, wireless devices that help identify item automatically and indicating unique serial number for each item. However, counterfeiting in supply chain management likes cloned and fraud RFID tag bring the impact to the organization and social when attackers want to gain illegal benefits.Organizationsarelosing a lot of money and trust from userswhen counterfeiting occurred. Furthermore, RFID data nature characteristics faces the issues likes RFID just carry simple information, in-flood of data, inaccuracy data from RFID readers and difficulties to track spatial and place. We propose to use clustering algorithms in order to detect counterfeit in supply chain management. We will apply various clustering algorithms to analyzed and determine every attribute in the dataset structure pattern. Based on evaluation that have done, we found that Farthest First is the best algorithm for 1000 (small data) and 10000 (bigger data). However, the values of false negative in data still quite high and it is dangerous if RFID scanner misread the cloned or fraud tags become genuine tags. Hence, we applied cost algorithms to reduce false negative values.},

 abstract = {This comprehensive study aims to identify from a strategic perspective a new port classification approach based on port features and characteristics. Data of 3,685 ports worldwide have been collected, and 25 dimensions with 62 factors have been identified and utilized to analyze and classify ports worldwide. The K-means clustering technique has been utilized to conduct the port classification process at several levels. First, ports have been classified into two general clusters (low capabilities and moderate-to-high capabilities). Then only ports with moderate-to-high potentials were classified and taxonomized. In addition to identifying and classifying ports with moderate-to-high capabilities, findings of the second round demonstrate the existence of three main clusters. The new port classification has been used to provide new insights about the top 50 terminal ports as a real case study. This innovative approach is valuable for most port-related decision-making situations and facilitates the global supply chain management processes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Literature is used to identify various factors for the decision environment. An illustrative problem provides insights into the methodology and application. Findings - The results indicate that green products can be evaluated from both their relative environmental burdens and benefits. Sustainable consumption and production factors that play a role in this multifactor decision are identified. The results show that a comprehensive evaluation can capture an effective overall picture on which green product(s) to delete. Research limitations/implications - The opaqueness of the proposed methodology may cause less acceptance by management. The methodology made a number of assumptions related to the data. An actual application of the tool rather than just an illustrative example is needed. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is the novel integration of supply chain perspectives, both upstream (supply and production) and downstream (demand/usage), with green product deletion decision making. The hybrid multistage technique has advantages of being able to incorporate many factors that have a variety of quantitative and qualitative characteristics to help managers address green product deletion issues as well as its impact on greening of supply chains and organizational environmental sustainability. This paper adds value to product deletion, supply chain management, and sustainable production and consumption literatures. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Reasonable logistics distribution network structure can not only effectively reduce the cost of logistics enterprises themselves but also reduce the social cost. Through effective supply chain management, enterprises can significantly reduce costs, improve competitiveness, and enhance their ability to resist risks. Because the single-level distribution network structure of production enterprises is not suitable for large-scale logistics distribution, this paper proposes a distribution network structure design that accords with economies of scale and establishes an enterprise supply chain optimization model based on the fuzzy clustering algorithm. Using this optimization method to optimize the inventory of enterprise logistics supply chain, the operation is fast, the result is correct and reasonable, and it can provide good decision support for the distribution network of logistics enterprises. Through information technology and modern management technology, we should effectively control and coordinate the logistics, information flow, and capital flow in the production and operation process and organically integrate the internal supply chain with the external supply chain for management, so as to achieve the goal of global optimization. © 2021 Shizhen Bai and Hongbin Sun.},

 abstract = {Purpose–The purpose of this paper is to develop a forecasting model for retailers based on customer segmentation, to improve performance of inventory. Design/methodology/approach–The research makes an attempt to capture the knowledge of segmenting the customers based on various attributes as an input to the demand forecasting in a retail store. The paper suggests a data mining model which has been used for forecasting of demand. The proposed model has been applied for forecasting demands of eight SKUs for grocery items in a supermarket. Based on the proposed forecasting model, the inventory performance has been studied with simulation. Findings–The proposed forecasting model with the inventory replenishment system results in the reduction of inventory level and increase in customer service level. Hence, the proposed model in the paper results in improved performance of inventory. Practical implicationsRetailers can make use of the proposed model for demand forecasting of various items to improve the inventory performance and profitability of operations. Originality/value–With the advent of data mining systems which have given rise to the use of business intelligence in various domains, the current paper addresses one of the most pressing issues in retail management, as demand forecasting with minimum error is the key to success in inventory and supply chain management.

 abstract = {Recommender system is a computer-based intelligent technique which facilitates the customers to fulfill their purchase requirements. In addition to this, it also helps retailers to manage the supply chain of their business and to develop different business strategies keeping in pace with the current market. Supply chain management (SCM) involves the streamlining of a business’s supply-side activities to remain competitive in the business landscape. Maximizing the customer value is another important activity of SCM to gain an advantage in the market. In this work, the K-Means clustering algorithm has been used for the effective segmentation of customers who have bought apparel items. PCA has been used for dimensionality reduction of different features of products and customers. The main focus of this work is to determine the different possible associations of customers in terms of brand, product, and price from their purchase habits. The result shows that the clusters made by the algorithm based on PCA and K-Means are similar and the results are acceptable on the basis of feedback received from existing customers and satisfies the customers’ requirements based on the amount of money (price range) the customers want to spend while doing online shopping. The features of products purchased by customers were combined together to generate a unique product key for business, and a model was prepared to segment products based on the volume of products sold and revenue generated, and the price of products sold and revenue generated. This work, in the long run, will help business houses to build a sustainable, profitable, and scalable e-commerce business. Environmental, social, and economic aspects are important to make e-commerce more sustainable for the benefit of the society. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

@article{Bask2013380,
 abstract = {Purpose: Consumer values increasingly favor sustainable development in products and services, thereby fostering the need to develop new operational and managerial practices that support sustainability in supply chain management. The purpose of this study is to identify relevant product features related to sustainable development in this context, and use the choice of mobile phone as an example in measuring their importance. Design/methodology/approach: The study used two different methods (qualitative and quantitative) in two phases. First it organized focus-group discussions in order to identify the features of sustainability that affect the choice of a mobile phone. The most significant features served as a starting point for the choice of attributes to be included in the final step, choice-based conjoint analysis (CBC), which assesses respondents' value functions by means of latent class clustering. Between the two major phases it carried out two additional pre-tests in order to reduce the number of attributes. Findings: The results provide fundamental information concerning the relative importance of sustainability features in the selection of a mobile phone. The study identified four different clusters of purchasers: updaters, budgeters, environmentalists, and long-life users. According to the findings, some consumers are willing to pay a premium for sustainability features. The authors discuss the potential implications of the results in the context of supply chain design. Originality/value: The literature on supply chain management tends to see the consumers as a "black box". This paper reports the first results of opening this box by linking the supply chain perspective to consumer choice behavior. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {The singularities of the food industry supply chain and possibilities to apply the temperature control technologies, considering the different aspects of supply chain management, are analysed in this paper. The statistical analysis of the food industry supply chain is presented. The paper describes how the system for distribution of chilled and frozen food, from manufacturer to end-user, operates in small market countries, focusing on temperature control influence on the energy consumption. Taking into account the analysed information, it was concluded that clustering processes can dramatically reduce the cost of food supply chain.},

 abstract = {Research on port competitiveness is necessary for the development of countries' economies and is also important for the survival and development of ports. In this work, we have identified the main factors related to the assessment of the provided port competitiveness based on a literature review. Next, we have compared the port competitiveness limited to the Mediterranean basin according to 5 criteria (Connectivity Index, Container Traffic, Port Infrastructure Quality, Export Cost and Import Cost). As part of this article, we have adopted the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method and the Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) of during the period 2010-2018. The results show the existence of two elements that prevent the competitiveness of Mediterranean port systems (Export Cost and Import Cost), and we need a strategy to improve competitiveness. The Hierarchical Cluster Analysis gave us three classes of countries. In the first class, Tunisia and Albania are classified according to their quality of port infrastructure. The second class includes Syria, Algeria, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro according to the cost of export and import. The third class is made up of France, Italy, Turkey and Spain. These countries have a big volume of trade and high connectivity with other countries. © 2020 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Supply Chain Planning (SCP) problems can be effectively modeled through the Multiobjectives Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) paradigm. MIP-based “scalarization”techniques (Mixed-Integer Programming) have been successfully exploited for solving SCP optimization problems characterized by numerous conflicting objectives and supply chain-specific constraints. Nevertheless, the planning of complex and large-scale SCP instances remains often a real challenge because of the huge number of decision variables to handle. This chapter presents a new methodology, “Variables Clustering Method”(VCM), that aims at systematic reduction of the number of decision variables required by any SCP model. VCM can be applied to a general SCP paradigm and exploited in several industries sectors enlarging the class of solvable instances. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Purpose – The Canadian apparel industry has long been challenged by imports from low-wage countries while its exports have declined since their height in 2002. This situation was exacerbated with trade liberalisation, which started in January 2005. Data from Industry Canada and a number of studies, amongst which those of the Apparel Human Resources Council (AHRC), showing the adverse effects of trade liberalisation since the phasing out of the multi-fibre agreement in 2005, the lack of competitive advantage for Canada as an apparel manufacturing nation and the subsequent rapid decline of its apparel industry, pointed to the need for a strategic response from the Canadian apparel industry, particularly from small to medium-sized enterprises. A study conducted for the AHRC of the Federal Government of Canada outlined a number of strategies that Canadian apparel companies could pursue, focusing on elements other than manufacturing in the traditional apparel value chain. These strategies seemed to suggest the implementation of a cluster approach where greater cooperation between suppliers would be required throughout the supply chain with a focus on functional expertise and relationships. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether a cluster strategy is being applied or if indeed it is applicable to Canada’s apparel companies. Design/methodology/approach – A literature search, was undertaken to find the options available for the organisation of SMEs so that: an analytical framework could be created from the various theories and concepts that; would enable the evidence-based selection of an option or options suitable for adoption by Canadian apparel SMEs, to assist them to be more effective than stand-alone enterprises. Data were collected from case studies of Canadian apparel companies, an Experience Survey (conducted through face-to-face interviews with the directors of the AHRC, the Canadian Apparel Federation, Industry Canada, and Canadian retail and apparel supply executives) and from the responses to an online questionnaire sent to Canadian apparel suppliers. The data were subjected to examination using the analytical framework to determine whether the evidence existed on which to base a cluster-based strategic response to competition from overseas apparel suppliers, or whether one of the alternative options might be a more suitable match with the Canadian apparel business environment. Findings – Neither the case studies nor the Experience Survey revealed sufficient evidence of open communication or of cooperation among suppliers in areas that would fortify horizontal clustering amongst apparel SMEs, such as the sharing of labour, market research or supply chain management; similar findings emerged from the online questionnaire sent to Canadian apparel suppliers, which showed little evidence favouring cluster development as a strategic response for the Canadian apparel supply industry. The research also showed that industrialists, experts and government advisors all recognised that, beginning with trade liberalisation in 2005, there had been a transformation of the Canadian apparel industry from a manufacturing to a service industry with the retailers taking much stronger control of the supply chain than before, which, taken together with the lack of open communication or cooperation among apparel suppliers gives rise to conditions which favour collaboration over clustering. Originality/value – The paper provides a firm evidence base upon which to develop a different strategy for Canadian SMEs than the cluster approach that has been proposed to date. The findings reported in this paper show that Canadian apparel industry leaders, government and industry-led support organisations, retailers and suppliers all recognise that the type of open communication or of cooperation among suppliers in areas that would fortify horizontal clustering amongst apparel SMEs, such as the sharing of labour, market research or supply chain management does not occur to a sufficient extent to support the adoption of a cluster strategy by the Canadian apparel sector (although it may be applicable in Quebec). Canadian retailers have now taken the leading role in the supplier/ retailer relationship. Any future strategy will need to take account of this repositioning of retailers and be centred upon vertical relationships between individual apparel suppliers and retailers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {As the world is moving into a sustainable era, achieving zero hunger has become one of the top three Sustainable Development Goals, applying a considerable amount of pressure on the agri-food systems to make decisions contemplating the sustainability dimensions. Accordingly, making effective supply chain decisions holistically while achieving sustainability goals has become a major challenge faced by the present agri-food systems. Thus, to address the challenge, a novel supply chain configuration addressing multiple supply chain decisions to reduce global warming potential (GWP) and post-harvest losses have been presented by taking the banana supply chain in Sri Lanka as a case study. In the proposed approach, farmers have been clustered based on their geo positions using K-Means clustering followed by route planning within clusters using a heuristics approach. Retailer points are catered by assigning to wholesalers optimally modeling as an assignment model and then route planning executed using a heuristic approach. The solution generated from the above approaches has been implemented on a simulation platform to calculate the overall supply chain performance including the transportation component, in terms of the net GWP, post-harvest losses, and lead time including routing operations. Simulated supply chain performance has been compared with the existing system and verified the performance of the proposed supply chain configuration. The suggested configuration has reduced the net GWP by 15.3%, post-harvest loss by 2.1%, lead time by 28.2%, and travel distance by 20.47%. The proposed configuration can be further improved by adding dynamic characteristics to the model. © 2022 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Performance evaluation of suppliers is increasingly recognized as a critical indicator in supply chain cooperation. Traditional performance evaluation methods have the problems of a simple buy/sell relation and in one's subjective views between manufacturers and suppliers, and they lack objective automatic evaluation processes in the supply chain considered. Statistical techniques used for evaluation rely on the restrictive assumptions of linear separability, multivariate normality, and independence of the predictive variables. Unfortunately, many of the common models of performance evaluation of suppliers violate these assumptions. The study proposes an integrated model by combining K-means clustering, feature selection, and the decision tree method into a single evaluation model to assess the performance of suppliers and simultaneously tackles the abovementioned shortcomings. The integrated model is illustrated with an empirical case study of a manufacturer for an original design manufacturer (ODM) to demonstrate the model performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms listed methods in terms of accuracy, and three redundant attributes can be eliminated from the empirical case. Furthermore, the extracted rules by the decision tree C4.5 algorithm form an automatic knowledge system for supplier performance evaluation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

 abstract = {Supply chain management aims at delivering goods in the shortest time at the lowest possible price while ensuring the best possible quality and is now vital to the success of the online retail business. Executing effective warehouse site selection has been one of the key challenges in the development of a successful supply chain system. While some effective strategies for warehouse site selection have been identified by the domain experts based on their experiences, the emergence of new ways of collecting fine-grained supply chain data has enabled a new paradigm for warehouse site selection. Indeed, in this paper, we provide a data-smart approach for addressing the connected capacitated warehouse location problem (CCWL), which searches for the minimum total transportation cost of the warehouse network including supplier-warehouses shipping cost, warehouse-customer delivering cost and the cost of warehouse-warehouse inter-transportation. Specifically, we first design a sales distribution prediction model and evaluate the importance of customer logistic service utilities on online market sales demand for online retailers. Then, we propose the E&M algorithm to optimize warehouse locations continuously with much less computation cost. Moreover, the computation cost is further reduced through delivery demand based Hierarchical Clustering which reduces the problem size by grouping delivering cities with close locations. Finally, we validate the proposed method on real-world e-Commerce supply chain data and the selection effect of new warehouses is evaluated in terms of sales improvement with faster delivery and more effective inventory management. © 2017 IEEE.},

There is a need for new methods and tools to visualize the supply chain topologies which captures and recognizes the complexity of the supply chain network. This paper presents a Knowledge-based Customization System for Supply Chain Integration (KCSSI) which is developed based on three core technologies: visualization of topologies, network analysis, and knowledge-based system so as to obtain quantified actionable information and formulating strategies for supply chain configuration leading the long term success. The performance of the system is verified by a series of controlled simulation experiments conducted in a selected reference site. It is verified that the KCSSI improves supply chain visibility by recognizing the structure clustering and interconnection of the supply chain network, quantifying and exploiting holistic supply chain performance to provide measurable insights for the customization of the supply chain configuration leading to long term success. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a novel domain-concept association rules (DCAR) mining algorithm that offers solutions to complex cell formation problems, which consist of a non-binary machine-component (MC) matrix and production factors for fast and accurate decision support. Design-methodology-approach The DCAR algorithm first identifies the domain-concept from the demand history and then performs association rule mining to find associations among machines. After that, the algorithm forms machine-cells with a series of inclusion and exclusion processes to minimize inter-cell material movement and intra-cell void element costs as well as to maximize the grouping efficacy with the constraints of bill of material (BOM) and the maximum number of machines allowed for each cell. Findings The DCAR algorithm delivers either comparable or better results than the existing approaches using known binary datasets. The paper demonstrates that the DCAR can obtain satisfying machine-cells with production costs when extra parameters are needed. Research limitations-implications The DCAR algorithm adapts the idea of the sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) to iteratively evaluate and arrange machine-cells until the result is stabilized. The SFFS is an improvement over a greedy version of the algorithm, but can only ensure sub-optimal solutions. Practical implications – The DCAR algorithm considers a wide range of production parameters, which make the algorithm suitable to the real-world manufacturing system settings. Originality-value The proposed DCAR algorithm is unlike other array-based algorithms. It can group non-binary MC matrix with considerations of real-world factors including product demand, BOM, costs, and maximum number of machines allowed for each cell. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

 abstract = {Nowadays global supply chains enable companies to enhance competitive advantages, increase manufacturing flexibility and reduce costs through a broader selection of suppliers. Despite these benefits, however, insufficient understanding of uncertain regional differences and changes often increases risks in supply chain operations and even leads to a complete disruption of a supply chain. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a text-mining based global supply chain risk management framework involving two phases. First, the extant literature about global supply chain risks was collected and analyzed using a text-based approaches, including term frequency, correlation, and bi-gram analysis. The results of these analyses revealed whether the term-related content is important in the studied literature, and correlated topic model clustering further assisted in defining potential supply chain risk factors. A risk categorization (hierarchy) containing a total of seven global supply chain risk types and underlying risk factors was developed based on the results. In the second phase, utilizing these risk factors, sentiment analysis was conducted on online news articles, selected according to the specific type of risk, to recognize the pattern of risk variation. The risk hierarchy and sentiment analysis results can improve the understanding of regional global supply chain risks and provide guidance in supplier selection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the two most prominent wireless technologies for implementing a complete smart environment for Internet of Things (IoT). Both technologies complement each other hence integration of both is used in a wide variety of applications like: Traffic management, health, care monitoring systems, war-field, animal tracking, supply chain management etc. Security issue are of the most important concern and constraint of these kind of networks as both RFID and sensor networks have scarcity of resources which requires light computation based cryptography. In this work one cryptographic primitive of security, availability, is ensured through outlier detection mechanism. A threshold based anomaly detection mechanism is proposed which allows inliers only for secure communication, thus ensures availability. © 2016 IEEE.},

Mining such amount of data is a challenging problem, since the possibility to extract useful information from this peculiar kind of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, hand-off in cellular networks, supply chain management. Moreover, spatial data streams pose interesting challenges for their proper representation, thus making the mining process harder than for classical point data. In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory data streams clustering, that revealed really intriguing as we deal with a kind of data (trajectories) for which the order of elements is relevant. We propose a complete framework starting from data preparation task that allows us to make the mining step quite effective. Since the validation of data mining approaches has to be experimental we performed several tests on real world datasets that confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

 abstract = {Purchasing is one of the most important supply chain processes which its improvement affects on the whole supply chain's performance. The most critical stage of this process is the best supplier selection, while considering probable changes in candidates' specifications during time and the costs and computational time of selection. In this paper, we propose a context aware system via data clustering algorithms for dynamic selection. Our proposed model only considers the unsteady clusters instead of all clusters, runs the selection algorithm on the best set of suppliers from the previous decision period and reduces the time of selection process while achieving an acceptable purchasing cost. We design an e-shopping website for Internet-based trading citrus product. While suppliers introduce themselves in some properties and show their changed specifications through this website, customers can also order their needs by features determination. Implementing this system which provides direct communication between supplier and consumer, will save time and cost, and provide profitability for the entire supply chain. © 2011 MIPRO.},

 abstract = {Finding frequent patterns from databases has been the most researched topic in association-rule mining. Business-Intelligence using data-mining has felt an increased thrust for real-time frequent pattern mining algorithms finding huge demand from numerous real-time business applications like e-commerce, recommender-systems, group-decision-support-systems, supply-chain-management, to name a few. Last decade has seen development of mind-whelming algorithms, among which, vertical-mining algorithms have been found to be very effective. However, with dense-datasets, the performances of these algorithms significantly degrade. Moreover, these algorithms are not suited to respond to the real-time need. In this paper, we describe BDFS(b)-diff-sets, an algorithm to perform real-time frequent pattern mining using diff-sets and using an intelligent staged search technique, by-passing usual breadth-first and depth-first search-techniques. Empirical evaluations show that our algorithm can make a fair estimation of the probable frequent-patterns reacting to the user-defined time bound and reaches some of the longest frequent patterns much faster than the existing algorithms. © 2005 IEEE.},

By the application of CRM, greater efficacy and effectiveness in delivering strategies could be achieved. To support CRM in retail sector, many data mining techniques are applied in identifying, attracting, developing and retaining the customer's relationships. On the other hand, the retailers are unable to predict the demand of products which may leads to inconsistencies in profit by the use of CRM. To overcome this disadvantage, an integrated version of CRM along with Supply Chain Management (SCM) is designed which affords the stock requirement from SCM based on the demand in CRM. Thus SCM with CRM enhances the retailers profit, meet the customer's demand and retain the current customers. © 2014 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Purpose - In the light of lessons learned from recent disasters (The London subway bombings, and Hurricane Katrina), it has become increasingly clear that supply chain partners as well as government agencies need to be prepared to communicate effectively to consumers and customers before, during and after a disaster. Effective communication can minimize confusion and harm to company reputations, to consumers, the economy and the nation. Incorporating consistent communications into supply chain management (SCM) plans used by all parties in the supply chain will enhance competitiveness of the whole chain and speed recovery from potentially disastrous events. Findings from a national survey of consumer's attitudes about terrorism provide information about the development of targeted and effective communications. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a survey of more than 4,000 US consumers, this study used "predictive segmentation" which consists of a canonical factor analysis relating general consumer attitudes and values to their more specific fears and concerns about terrorism. A clustering of consumers then identifies six diverse consumer segments providing a framework for the development of communication strategies. Findings - Results from this study demonstrate that people can be grouped based on their general attitudes and values in such a way that their diversity can be captured in a simple framework of segments each reflecting striking differences in the level of concern over potential terrorist attacks. Practical implications - Guidance is offered for the development of communication strategies based on the information needs and media behavior of each consumer segment to mitigate the impact of a potential terrorist attack or catastrophic food safety breaches.It provides practical and logical extension of former studies that suggest incorporating consumers, attitudes into SCM and business continuity plans. Originality/value - This study leverages a common and proven marketing research approach - segmentation - used in private industry for the marketing of goods and service. It applies this method to defining segments of consumers based on their attitudes and concerns about terrorism that will be useful in supply chain communication management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {The Apriori algorithm has become an important research topic in the current information technology field and has received extensive attention. With the maturity of the Apriori algorithm, the Apriori algorithm has gradually been applied to the field of enterprise supply chain management. Therefore, applying the Apriori algorithm to enterprise supply chain management has far-reaching significance for improving the core competitiveness of enterprises. The purpose of this article is to study the construction of a drug supply chain model based on the Apriori algorithm. In this paper, a theoretical model of drug knowledge transfer based on these three channels is established, and the methods and characteristics of drug knowledge transfer in the model are analyzed. On this basis, the construction of a medical supply chain model based on the Apriori algorithm is proposed, with a view to The model construction of the supply chain provides theoretical guidance. Experimental research shows that this article analyzes 90,000 pieces of data in the drug supply chain, and the experiment shows that the Apriori_Reduce algorithm proposed in this article has more obvious performance advantages with a smaller degree of support. © 2022 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Travel scheme planning is a crucial operational-level decision to be made in travel supply chain management. We investigate an integrated self-driving travel scheme planning (ISTSP) problem to optimize routing, hotel selection, and time scheduling under several streams of personalized considerations: best site-viewing time windows, rest requirements, and preference for site visiting sequences. The travel scheme planning problem is formulated in two models: (i) total cost minimization, and (ii) bi-objective optimization with total cost minimization and tourists’ utility maximization. A heuristic solution framework integrating multi-categorical attribute K-means clustering, dynamic programming algorithm, and constraint satisfaction procedure is designed to solve these two models. Finally, we provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed models and solution methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

(eds.), Advances in Water Resources and Exploration. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 93, pp. 1047-1052. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. In order to realize the optimal scheduling and automatic identification of port logistics service supply chain information, it is necessary to design the contract coordination management of port logistics service supply chain information. A coordinated management model of port logistics service supply chain information contract based on grid area reconstruction learning clustering is proposed. The fuzzy association rule scheduling technology is used to sample the port logistics service supply chain information, and the port logistics service supply chain information collected by RFID is processed by information fusion. The autocorrelation statistical regression analysis method is used to extract the correlation statistical features of port logistics service supply chain information, and the matching filtering method is used to detect the redundant features of port logistics service supply chain information for interference suppression filtering. The purified port logistics service supply chain information is reconstructed by phase space reconstruction technology, and the reconstructed data is classified and identified by grid area reconstruction learning clustering classifier. The contract coordination management and automatic retrieval of port logistics service supply chain information are realized. The simulation results show that the automatic classification of port logistics service supply chain information contract coordination management is good, and the fuzzy clustering ability is strong, which improves the coordination management ability of port logistics service supply chain information contract. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.},

 abstract = {Modern value-added processes will be globally cross-linked through outsourcing and reduction of real net output ratio. Therefore logistical planning and control processes become more complex. Events in supply networks and their consequences to the partners in the supply network will be hard to overlook without using computer based decision support system. This paper describes such a decision support system that learns rules for controlling a production network. In detail the system architecture will be described, requirements to such a system will be identified and a solution developed at the Heinz Nixdorf Institute in Paderborn will be presented. The solution is based on a Q-learning approach supported by a k-means clustering algorithm.},

 abstract = {Supplier evaluation and selection is one of the most critical strategic decisions for developing a competitive and sustainable organization. Companies have to consider supplier related risks and threats in their purchasing decisions. In today's competitive and risky business environment, it is very important to work with reliable suppliers. This study proposes a clustering based approach to group suppliers based on their risk profile. Suppliers of a company in the heavy-machinery sector are assessed based on 17 qualitative and quantitative risk types. The weights of the criteria are determined by using the Best-Worst method. Four factors are extracted by applying Factor Analysis to the supplier risk data. Then k-means clustering algorithm is applied to group core suppliers of the company based on the four risk factors. Three clusters are created with different risk exposure levels. The interpretation of the results provides insights for risk management actions and supplier development programs to mitigate supplier risk. © 2018 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Over the last years, a new developed paradigm known as Physical Internet (PI) has been appeared, and studied in logistics management. The purpose of this global and open system is to deal with logistics grand challenge by setting up an efficient and sustainable Logistics Web. Methodology and approach: The purpose of this paper is to review of scientific articles dedicated to Physical Internet topic, and to provide a clustering strategy enabling to classify the literature on the Physical Internet, to follow its evolution, as well as to criticize it. The classification is based on three factors: Logistics Web, organization, and resources. Results: Several papers about Physical Internet have been classified and analyzed along the Logistics Web, resources and organization views at a strategic, tactical and operational level, respectively. A developed cluster analyses shows that Physical Internet needs more studies and more analyses to be adopted.

 abstract = {One of the greatest 21st century challenges is meeting the need to feed a growing world population which is expected to increase by about 35% by 2050. To meet this challenge, it is necessary to make major improvements on current food production and distribution systems capabilities, as well as to adapt these systems to expected trends such as climate change. Changing climate patterns may present opportunities for unidentified, geographical regions with adequate climate patterns to produce high-value agricultural products in a profitable and sustainable manner. This paper focuses on the design and planning aspects of a discovery process to unearth agri-food supply chains capable of generating attractive return on investments. A stochastic optimization framework is used to develop planting and harvesting schedules for a set of identified regions with complementary weather characteristics. To address the high-level of variability in the problem context, a two-stage stochastic decomposition method is used to consider a larger number of scenarios. As part of the solution process, a modeling scheme is developed that learns past interactions between entering discretized, weather scenarios and optimal first-stage solutions. In this context, machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques are used to iteratively estimate each region's probability of belonging to first-stage solutions based on previous solution-scenario results. The implementation of the stochastic framework is shown through a case study applied to multiple locations within the US southwest states of Arizona and New Mexico. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Driven by the growing concern regarding greenhouse gas emissions, in this work, we provide a robust stochastic model for the design of a cooperative supply chain (SC) under uncertainty in CO2 allowance prices from the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). During the last years, CO2 allowance prices have undergone unexpected changes, having strong impact on the design and management of optimal SC. The consideration of uncertainty in the allowance prices has therefore become more important. We use an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict future allowance prices. A full discretization of the underlying probability space leads to a number of scenarios far too large to be handled, so we compare two approaches to reduce the number of scenarios to a feasible maximum, the ScenRed algorithm and K-means clustering. The obtained results are compared with a deterministic approach that is widely studied in the literature, showing an increase in the benefits and a reduction of emissions. © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

 abstract = {algorithms could provide as a means of producing efficient and flexible inventory management methods. In this way, although there are some methods to carry out this practice, none are set up for impulse purchase products. This article illustrates this perspective within the context of an impulse purchase product provisioning problem and shows how group policies based on a clustering process can result in better (lower cost) groupings. To solve this problem, a method is proposed for finding a near-optimal inventory grouping solution. The key innovation in this solution is the idea to form groups for the items that have similar demand or ordering and cost characteristics. Subsequently, once the clusters have been formed, it was necessary to look at aggregating impulse purchase SKUs, and then two grouping techniques or heuristics that both consider common characteristics and develop some ordering decision rules are presented. The results show that the proposed method can be used to cluster impulse purchase products more effectively and the grouping techniques applied were efficient in terms of solution quality. The aim of the proposed unsupervised clustering-based method was not only to provide a classification of SKUs free of subjectivity processes but also to provide an approach to apply more efficient inventory policies for impulse purchase products. © 2021 School of Science, IHU.

 abstract = {Network structures present within themselves specific characterization of their topological structures and connectivity. The properties of a given network change significantly as failure of its nodes and edges takes place. The failure of a node and/or edge reinstates the properties for the entire network. This paper aims to identify critical nodes and edges, the failure of which brings maximum change in the network properties. Clustering has been applied in this study for the identification process. The methodology discussed in this article would be helpful in tracking multi-states which a network undergoes due to failure of its nodes and edges. The proposed methodology would provide a holistic view for criticality of nodes and edges at both local and global level for a network. An optimum maintenance plan could then be devised for the critical nodes and edges to provide the system with a robust and resilient network. The proposed approach could be applied in power grid transmission, supply chain management, transportation and communication networks, oil, gas, power and water distribution networks to ensure continuous information and commodity flow through the networks. The methodology has been demonstrated with a case study in water distribution network. By applying the methodology, top five critical nodes and edges have been identified for the water distribution system. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {As the result of traffic state clustering, only the characteristics of the data itself are represented; it lacks traffic theory basis. The consistency verification is proposed in this paper. Firstly, using the traffic state dividing theory from the perspective of combining theory and practice, the traffic state dividing machine is constructed based on Fuzzy C-means Clustering. Secondly, the completeness of detecting data on the road section is classified into three types: (1) contains congestion, but lacks top data in the statistical period; (2) contains both congestion and top data; and (3) does not contain congestion. Thirdly, the consistency of the clustering result and traffic state dividing theory is verified by a non-parametric statistical test method. Finally, data is taken from 43 dual-loops on the eastern side of the Shanghai north-south expressway for 10 days as examples, and the empirical analysis is realized. The results show that the samples of the first and second types are all successfully verified. That is to say, the traffic state clustering results of these two types can be taken as the final result of traffic state identification, but the clustering results of the third type need be modified by regression analysis. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

 abstract = {Collaboration between partners is a very popular subject in both logistics and decision support research. However, transport management is often taken into account only as an external cost, without integration in collaborative reasoning. This paper proposes a framework to assess collaborative solutions in the context of logistics and freight transport, as well as to describe the links between freight transport and supply chain management in terms of collaboration techniques. First die main concepts of collaborative logistics in the distribution and transport fields are presented, highlighting die links between collaboration, freight transport and supply chain management. Then, the method to assess collaborative logistics and freight transport solutions is proposed. This mediod includes a design scheme, a hierarchic clustering technique and a dominance analysis method to unify the assessment of each individual and prepare collaborative research for a common solution. After that, the method is applied to the assessment of five scenarios derived from a real situation for the urban area of Lyon (France) to illustrate how difficult convergence towards consensus is. The results show that a global optimal solution for the entire set of stakeholders is not easy to identify, and how the proposed method can be helpful for decision makers to achieve a consensus of common objectives.},

 abstract = {The aim of a sustainable supply chain is the strategic integration of all social, environmental and economic goals within an organization, through a systematic coordination of key business processes in order to improve the long-term economic performance of a company and its value chain. This paper describes a new methodological approach to support the strategy formulation process in sustainable supply chains. The proposed methodology combines three analytical tools (analytic hierarchical process, fuzzy multi-objective optimization, and clustering methods) within a strategy formulation process, integrating the competitive and corporative strategies with the supply chain strategy on the basis of sustainability. A case study in the Mexican Federal Commission of Electricity Gulf-Center Distribution Division shows the capability of our proposed framework. This company is large and complex enough to encompass the whole issue of the supply chain. Results indicate that our methodology is a valid decision support tool to formulate a set of sustainable supply chain strategies, and it is able to generate a coordinated strategy for the management of a sustainable supply chain. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

 abstract = {The management of supply chains is becoming more important in economic and social environments. Currently, the social sustainability is a factor that must be considered to design governmental strategies and policies. The objective of this research paper was to show, with a case study an approach to optimize distribution and delivery logistics of food in a social assistance program of school breakfast using mathematical models that include transportation distance, optimal locations, and vehicle routing through different clusters. By using qualitative variables like poverty levels, food insecurity and social exclusion, different clustering methods are proposed with the purpose of identifying the common characteristics in the studied population; and at the same time, reducing the distribution complexity. The results show an efficient approach to design a supply chain that includes economic and social factors. The new model developed in this paper can be used to plan social assistance governmental programs, to identify the specific needs and characteristics of the beneficiaries, minimizing the total cost of the distribution network logistics when delivering food for school meals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Accurate forecasting of a high variability time series has relevance in many applications such as supply-chain management, price prediction in stock markets and demand forecasting in the energy segment. Most often forecasts of such time series depend on many factors ranging from weather to socio-economic attributes such as GDP or average income. Dependence on such features can cause the underlying time series to be highly variable in nature and possess non-stationary shifts. Most traditional forecasting methods fail to capture such trend shifts and high variability present in the data. Further, for certain applications, it may be necessary to estimate the confidence of the forecasts. In this work, we propose two variants of recurrent mixture density network (RMDN), for time series forecasting, that have the ability to handle high-dimensional input features, capture trend shifts and high variability present in the data, and provide a confidence estimate of the forecast. To this end, we first pass the high-dimensional time series data through a feedforward layer, which performs dimensionality reduction or feature selection in an unsupervised manner by inducing sparsity on the weights of the feedforward layer. The resultant low-dimensional time series is then fed through recurrent layers to capture temporal patterns. These recurrent layers also aid in learning the latent representation of the input data. Thereafter, a mixture density network (MDN) is used to model the variability and trend shifts present in the input and it also estimates the confidence of the predictions. The models are trained in an end-to-end fashion and the efficacy of the proposed models is demonstrated on three publicly available datasets from energy markets. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

 abstract = {While addressing supply chain planning under uncertainty, Robust Optimization (RO) is regarded as an efficient and tractable method. As RO involves calculation of several statistical moments or maximum / minimum values involving the objective functions under realizations of these uncertain parameters, the accuracy of this method significantly depends on the efficient techniques to sample the uncertainty parameter space with limited amount of data. Conventional sampling techniques, e.g. box/budget/ellipsoidal, work by sampling the uncertain parameter space inefficiently, often leading to inaccuracies in such estimations. This paper proposes a methodology to amalgamate machine learning and data analytics with RO, thereby making it data-driven. A novel neuro fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to cluster the uncertain space such that the exact regions of uncertainty are optimally identified. Subsequently, local density based boundary point detection and Delaunay triangulation based boundary construction enable intelligent Sobol based sampling to sample the uncertain parameter space more accurately. The proposed technique is utilized to explore the merits of RO towards addressing the uncertainty issues of product demand, machine uptime and production cost associated with a multiproduct, and multisite supply chain planning model. The uncertainty in supply chain model is thoroughly analysed by carefully constructing examples and its case studies leading to large scale mixed integer linear and nonlinear programming problems which were efficiently solved in GAMS® framework. Demonstration of efficacy of the proposed method over the box, budget and ellipsoidal sampling method through comprehensive analysis adds to other highlights of the current work. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brings about severe disruptions for human living, economics, and environmental balance. This pandemic has boosted the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and thus, medical wastes. Thus, a research hypothesis is stated whether it would be possible to provide more efficient distribution and inventory planning to optimize the PPE availability in a fuzzy environment. To confirm the hypothesis, in addition to addressing a scientific novelty considering integration of linear programming with fuzzy parameters, named as the Jimenez’s method and clustering heuristic methods, the practicality of these approaches is provided on a real case study and generated instances from Turkey. The computational results reveal that clustering the 32% of the hospitals ensures optimum total cost and solution time while feasibility degree changes between 0, 4, and 1 values of the Jimenez are not more effective on the results. Improved cost results reveal the economic importance of the healthcare supply chain management and optimal PPE distribution and inventory planning can break down the disease propagation and reduce the detrimental impacts on human life. The proposed approach, for the first time, ensures practical and theoretical insights of distribution and storage decisions across disciplines, namely, engineering and health-care organization authorities. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

There are so many factors whose assessment is fuzzy needed to be taken into account when operation management of emergency response supply chain is selected. A fuzzy hierarchical model is presented in this paper based on Analytic Hierarchy Process and Fuzzy Logic on consideration of technical parameters, technical program. By calculation comparison of indicators operation organizations are prioritized from their comprehensive assessment where systems' operation are classified into proper usage scopes and suitable operation systems are recommended. In the end, an optimization framework of operation management of emergency response supply chain based on fuzzy clustering is suggested. © 2011 IEEE.},

 abstract = {This study proposes an algorithm based upon the rounding strategy for the k-clustering minimum completion problem. An instance of the problem is defined in a complete bipartite graph of S and C vertices. The goal of the problem is to decompose the initial graph into k-clusters, where each cluster is a complete bipartite subgraph. Since the problem is NP hard, any exact solver, like Cplex, is often not sufficient to achieve solutions with relatively hight quality. Thus, we propose a first alternative solution procedure for tackling large-scale instances. The designed method can be viewed as a special variant of the rounding search-based algorithm and it can be applied for solving several complex optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a set of benchmark instances related to the k-clustering minimum completion problem, where its achieved results are compared to the best results available in the literature. © 2020 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Blockchain is one of the most anticipated technology revolutions, with immense promise in various applications. It is a distributed and encrypted database that can address a range of challenges connected to online security and trust. While many people identify Blockchain with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, it has a wide range of applications in supply chain management, health, Internet of Things (IoT), education, identity theft prevention, logistics, and the execution of digital smart contracts. Although Blockchain Technology (BT) has numerous advantages for Decentralized Applications (DApps), it is nevertheless vulnerable to abuse, smart contract failures, security, theft, trespassing, and other concerns. As a result, using Machine Learning (ML) models to detect anomalies is an excellent way to detect and safeguard blockchain networks from criminal activity. Adapting ensemble learning methods in ML to create better prediction outcomes is a viable approach for anomaly identification. Ensemble learning, as the name implies, refers to creating a stronger and more accurate classification by combining the prediction results of numerous weak models. As a result, an in-depth evaluation of ensemble learning methodologies for anomaly detection in the blockchain network ecosystem is applied in this paper. It comprises numerous ensemble methods (e.g., averaging, voting, stacking, boosting, bagging). The review collects data from three established databases, which are Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and Google Scholar. Specific keywords are employed, such as Blockchain, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Anomaly Detection, and Ensemble Learning, employing advanced searching algorithms. The results of the search found 60 primary articles from 2017 to 2022 (30 from Scopus, 20 from the WoS, and 10 from Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we decided to divide our debate into three primary themes: (1) the fundamentals of Blockchain Technology (BT), (2) the overview of ensemble learning, and (3) the integration and analysis of ensemble learning in blockchain networks for anomaly detection. In terms of awareness and knowledge, the results are also discussed in terms of what they mean and where future research should go © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.All Rights Reserved},

 abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to develop a genetic algorithm (GA)-based process knowledge integration system (GA-PKIS) for generalizing a set of nearly optimal fuzzy rules in quality enhancement based on the extracted fuzzy association rules in a supply chain network. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed methodology provides all levels of employees with the ability to formulate nearly optimal sets of fuzzy rules to identify possible solutions for eliminating the number of defect items. Findings - The application of the proposed methodology in the slider manufacturer has been studied. After performing the spatial analysis, the results obtained indicate that it is capable of ensuring the finished products with promising quality. Research limitations/implications - In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, only some processes within the supply chain are chosen. Future studies can advance this research by applying the proposed approach in different industries and processes. Originality/value - Because of the complexity of the logistics operations along the supply chain, the traditional quality improvement approaches cannot address all the quality problems automatically and effectively. This newly developed GA-based approach can help to optimize the process parameters along the supply chain network. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Warehouse management plays an important role in every manufacturing company. The inventory provides a buffer for the production plants. The Put-away process is one of the key activities in warehouse operations and has a significant impact on the overall performance of the warehouse. The put-away operation, if done effectively by the warehouse operators, helps the production plant to run smoothly. Warehouse management systems (WMS) can assist the warehouse operators in managing the warehouse. However, the current WMS cannot fulfill the individual warehouse objectives. Due to this drawback, warehouse operators have to rely solely on their knowledge and experience when doing the put-away process. As human beings are involved in the operation, mistakes and inconsistency cannot be avoided. Hence, as described in this paper, a RFID-based fuzzy storage assignment system (R-FSAS) has been developed to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the put-away process by means of formulating feasible and tailor-made storage plans for products coming into a warehouse. Through using R-FSAS, real-time warehouse operations are monitored by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, and a hybrid fuzzy association rule engine is adopted to formulate different storage plans. By applying R-FSAS in a manufacturing company, the overall results illustrate that R-FSAS enhances the efficiency of the put-away process in a warehouse.},

 abstract = {Presently, modern B2B supply chain management (B2B-SCM) equipped with semi-automated data logging systems accumulate large volumes. However, each SC unit in B2B-SC still individually develops their performance. Besides, their linkages of performance attributes between SC units still lack vital information extraction to improve theirs. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an integrated framework between B2B supply chain (B2B-SC) performance evaluation systems and data mining techniques, developing relationship rules of collaborative performance attribute enhancement. The methodology is as follows. Firstly, B2B-SC performance evaluation questionnaires based on two levels able to characterize collaborative relation between two or more partners in their SC were gathered from the case study companies. The data set of relationships between enterprise and its direct customers of the case study companies in France was used for demonstration. Secondly, data cleaning and preparations for rule extraction were performed on the questionnaire database. The significance of attribute was calculated using attribute ranking algorithms by means of information gain based on ranker search. These results were used to choose the crucial attributes from each micro view. Thirdly, web graph analysis was performed on this data to confirm the strong attribute relationship. Next, association rule was deployed to extract performance attribute relationship rules grounded on support and confidence cross validation method. The quality of each recognized rule is tested and, from numerous rules, only those that are statistically very strong and contain vital information are selected. Last but not least, these rules are interpreted by domain experts and studied by domain engineers to build a collaborative performance attribute enhancement road map. Furthermore, the final rule set of extracted rules contains very interesting information relating to SCs and also point out the critical existing SC attribute improvement. Ultimately, companies in this SC are able to use this framework to design and adjust their units to conform with the exact customer needs.},

 abstract = {This study deals with solving uncapacitated location-allocation (LA) problems with rectilinear distances by using a method based on Kohonen self-organizing feature maps (SOFMs). By treating LA problems as clustering problems, this method has the advantage of extracting the structure of the input data by a self-organizing process based on adaptation rules. In this paper, a heuristic method is constructed by using SOFMs with a guided refining procedure, and its performance is compared with simulated annealing. The experimental results using the proposed guided refining procedure to reinforce the SOFM method show that the proposed method is excellent in terms of quality of solution and speed of computation. In addition, the experimental results suggest that SOFMs may provide an excellent approach when generating initial solutions for other heuristic or exact algorithms. This conjecture is made because most of the solutions yielded by SOFM are close to the optimal solution in all experiments. Scope and purpose Given the location of a set of customers with different demands, the LA problem is to select the locations of a number of supply centers to serve the customers and to decide the corresponding allocation of the customers to supply centers under a given optimization criterion. The LA problem may arise in fire stations, hospitals, police stations, telecommunication networks, and warehouses relative to production facilities and customers. In addition, the recent rapid growth of demand for supply chain management, which can decrease the total cost, while improving the quality of goods and services of various organizations, has drawn significant research attention. As an important part of supply chain management, the LA problem is related to the facility management service, logistics and distribution, order entry and customer service operations. Therefore, it should be indicated much more than before for organizations to improve their competitive advantage. In solving the LA problem, the costs of transportation between customers and supply centers are proportional to an appropriately determined distance, e.g. the Euclidean distance or rectilinear distance. The location of supply centers and the allocation of customers to supply centers must be considered simultaneously. The capacities of supply centers in LA problems can either be fixed or treated without any limitation if the capacity of each supply center can be adjusted according to the amount of allocated service demands of customers, which are referred to as capacitated and uncapacitated problems, respectively. In addition, the assumption of no interaction between supply centers makes LA problems different from p-hub problems. Currently, existing algorithms for solving the LA problems cannot meet the demands of rapidly changing industrial or market environments, since they are either time consuming or provide poor-quality solutions. Therefore, in this article, we propose a heuristic method using Kohonen's feature maps, which are artificial neural networks capable of mapping the distribution of input data to specified neurons, with a guided refining procedure to solve uncapacitated LA problems. In addition, the investigation of appropriateness of using Kohonen's feature maps (called SOFMs) as an initial solution-generating method for another heuristic or exact method is also provided. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {In this study, we propose a two-echelon multi-objective dual-sale channel supply chain network (DCSCN) model. The goal is to determine (i) the set of installed DCs, (ii) the set of customers the DC should work with, how much inventory each DC should order and (iv) the distribution routes for physical retailers or online e-tailers (all starting and ending at the same DC). Our model overcomes the drawback by simultaneously tackling location and routing decisions. In addition to the typical costs associated with facility location and the inventory-related costs, we explicitly consider the pivotal routing costs between the DCs and their assigned customers. Therefore, a multiple objectives location-routing model involves two conflicting objectives is initially proposed so as to permit a comprehensive trade-off evaluation. To solve this multiple objectives programming problem, this study integrates genetic algorithms, clustering analysis, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). NSGA-II searches for the Pareto set. Several experiments are simulated to demonstrate the possibility and efficacy of the proposed approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

 abstract = {In past recent years, by increasing in the considerations on the significance of data science many studies have been developed concerning the big data structured problems. Along with the information science, in the field of decision science, multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches have been considerably applied in research studies. One of the most important procedures in supply chain management is selecting the optimal supplier to maintain the long-term productivity of the supply chain. There has been a vast amount of research which utilized MADM approaches to tackle the supplier selection problems, but only a few of these research considered big data structured problems. The current study presents a comprehensive novel approach for improving Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based on cluster analysis considering crisp big data structure input which is called CLUS-MCDA (Cluster analysis for improving Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis) algorithm. The proposed method is based on consolidating a data mining technique i.e. k-means clustering method and a MADM approach which is MULTIMOORA method. CLUS-MCDA method is a fast and practical approach which has been developed in this research which is implied in a supplier selection problem considering crisp big data structured input. A real-world case study in MAMUT multi-national corporation has been presented to show the validity and practicality of the CLUS-MCDA approach which calculated considering the business areas and criteria based on expert comments of mentioned organizations and previous literature on supplier selection problem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {The cram of supply chain management (SCM) is being considered as center of attention and motivation, not only among academics but also among practitioners in recent years. SCM systems face complexity, process's time compression, and lack ness of process optimization. In our current work, we present a broad framework for SCM, based on K-means clustering algorithm which concentrates on the supply chain (SC) processes for lessen the complexity, optimization factors in SC process communication, product variability and inaccurate forecast. Results show a feasibility to adopt this technique from a business analyst view point. © 2007 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to classify suppliers into some clusters based on sustainability factors. However, there might be some unqualified suppliers and we should identify and remove those suppliers before clustering. Design/methodology/approach: First, using fuzzy screening system, the authors identify and remove the unqualified suppliers. Then, the authors run their proposed clustering method. This paper proposes a data envelopment analysis (DEA) algorithm to cluster suppliers. Findings: This paper presents a two-aspect DEA-based algorithm for clustering suppliers into clusters. The first aspect applied DEA to consider efficient frontiers and the second aspect applied DEA to consider inefficient frontiers. The authors examine their proposed clustering approach by a numerical example. The results confirmed that their method can cluster DMUs into clusters. Originality/value: The main contributions of this paper are as follows: This paper develops a new clustering algorithm based on DEA models. This paper presents a new DEA model in inefficiency aspect. For the first time, the authors’ proposed algorithm uses fuzzy screening system and DEA to select suppliers. Our proposed method clusters suppliers of MPASR based on sustainability factors. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Moreover, with the complexities of issues such as the role of leadership, the influence of group formation, and analysis of disagreements, it cannot be predictable that there will ever exist a solution to cope with all imprecise, multi-criteria/multi-actor situations. A fuzzy association rules-based approach may be suited for the judgement of human subjects. In this paper, we develop an approach based on Fuzzy Association Rule Mining to support the decision makers by enhancing the flexibility in making decisions for evaluating suppliers with both tangibles and intangibles attributes. Also, by checking the fuzzy classification rules, the goal of knowledge acquisition can be achieved in a framework in which assessments could be established without constraints, and consequently checked and compared in several details. The efficacy and intricacy of the proposed model for finding fuzzy association rules from the database for supplier assessment is demonstrated with the help of numerical examples.},

 abstract = {Besides its effectiveness, supply chain management (SCM) is a complex process because of the stochastic and dynamic nature, multi-criterion and ever-increasing complexity of supply chains. Furthermore, companies have realized that agility is essential for their survival and competitiveness. Consequently, there is no generally accepted method by researchers and practitioners for designing, operating and evaluating agile supply chains. Moreover, the ability to build agile supply chain has developed more slowly than anticipated, because technology for managing agile supply chain is still being developed. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a new approach based on Fuzzy Association Rule Mining to support the decision makers by enhancing the flexibility in making decisions for evaluating agility with both tangibles and intangibles attributes/criteria such as Flexibility, Profitability, Quality, Innovativeness, Pro-activity, Speed of response, Cost and Robustness. Also, by checking the fuzzy classification rules, the goal of knowledge acquisition can be achieved in a framework in which evaluation of agility could be established without constraints, and consequently checked and compared in several details. Efficacy and intricacy of the proposed approach for finding fuzzy association rules from the database for evaluating agility is demonstrated with the help of a numerical example. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an analytical model for low carbon supplier development. This study is focused on the level of investment and collaboration decisions pertaining to emission reduction. Design/methodology/approach: The authors’ model includes a fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm and a fuzzy formal concept analysis. First, a set of suppliers were classified according to their carbon performances through the FCM clustering algorithm. Then, the fuzzy formal concepts were derived from a set of fuzzy formal contexts through an intersection-based method. These fuzzy formal concepts provide the relative level of investments and collaboration decisions for each identified supplier cluster. A case from the Indian renewable energy sector was used for illustration of the proposed analytical model. Findings: The proposed model and case illustration may help manufacturing firms to collaborate with their suppliers for improving their carbon performances. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to the low carbon supply chain management literature by identifying the decision criteria of investments toward low carbon supplier development. It also provides an analytical model of collaboration for low carbon supplier development. Though the purpose of the study is to illustrate the proposed analytical model, it would have been better if the model was empirically validated. Originality/value: Though the earlier studies on green supplier development program evaluation have considered a set of criteria to decide whether or not to invest on suppliers, these are silent on the relative level of investment required for a given set of suppliers. This study aims to fulfill this gap by providing an analytical model that will help a manufacturing firm to invest and collaborate with its suppliers for improving their carbon performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Sales forecasting is even more vital for supply chain management in e-commerce with a huge amount of transaction data generated every minute. In order to enhance the logistics service experience of customers and optimize inventory management, e-commerce enterprises focus more on improving the accuracy of sales prediction with machine learning algorithms. In this study, a C-A-XGBoost forecasting model is proposed taking sales features of commodities and tendency of data series into account, based on the XGBoost model. A C-XGBoost model is first established to forecast for each cluster of the resulting clusters based on two-step clustering algorithm, incorporating sales features into the C-XGBoost model as influencing factors of forecasting. Secondly, an A-XGBoost model is used to forecast the tendency with the ARIMA model for the linear part and the XGBoost model for the nonlinear part. The final results are summed by assigning weights to forecasting results of the C-XGBoost and A-XGBoost models. By comparison with the ARIMA, XGBoost, C-XGBoost, and A-XGBoost models using data from Jollychic cross-border e-commerce platform, the C-A-XGBoost is proved to outperform than other four models.

 abstract = {Purpose The integration of e-business and supply chain enables seamless information flow from suppliers to customer service network via the internet. It also enables better-coordinated materials flow from customer order to production, storage, distribution and delivery. The purpose of this paper is to describe the work that leads to the realisation of a hierarchical model for e-supply chain coordination and optimisation. Design/methodology/approach The model is based on an e-business information flow network in order to respond rapidly to the dynamics of e-supply chain and market. It can be used to realize management level strategies, and facilitate the planning and control of detailed operation schedules of supply chain units in an e-supply chain environment. Three main modules are discussed. They are routing and sequence optimiser (RSO) with the aid of a GA and TS-based multiple population search strategy (MPSS): supply chain virtual clustering (SCVC) based on fuzzy virtual clustering: and supply chain order scheduling (SCOS) using an agent-based distributed scheduling system. Findings These modules enable: the generation of preferred routings, transportation modes and work order plan under such constraints as customer service level, cycle time and cost: the formation of supply chain's unit-transportation-work order families using a clustering approach to down-size supply chain problems and increase computation efficiency: and the integration of scheduling with supply chain optimisation in order to facilitate the control of a supply chain with the aid of an agent-based distributed scheduling approach. Originality/value This paper proposed a hierarchical model for e-supply chain coordination and optimisation that is capable to solve large-scale problems. A MPSS using GA and TS was depicted in detail to expedite the RSO. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

To make up of existing drawbacks of association rule data mining algorithm, the paper brought out an improved algorithm and applies it in the product relativity analysis of SCM. Based on the algorithm, the solution of how the parts be arranged can achieve more cost-effective and higher profits can be achieved by data mining. The mining result can not only guide customers to correctly shopping, but also help manufacturers to design and produce goods, so that the companies can be in a better competitive position. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

 abstract = {To successfully reduce environmental emissions, companies need to expand the scope of their emissions accounting to include entire supply chains. A clustering approach has been used to find emission-intensive industry clusters. However, this approach did not include entire direct and indirect supply chains when forming high emission industry clusters. We propose a new method based on a modified normalized cut function with Leontief’s input–output model and basic clustering algorithms to find industry clusters with high levels of embodied within-cluster emissions that are well separated in the supply chain network. We use this method to identify 58 carbon-intensive clusters of Japanese industries and visualize the within-cluster supply chains in terms of embodied carbon flows. We recommend that companies collaborate within clusters to reduce environmental emissions. Our results provide new insights on where to target emissions reduction actions and technology development within industrial supply chains. © 2018, © 2018 The International Input–Output Association.},

 abstract = {Food safety exists in various links such as food production, processing, transportation and sales, which affects the stable development of society. It has become an urgent problem for all countries in the world as how to make effective use of various safety inspection techniques, optimize the food processing and storage safety, predict potential food safety factors, and accurately assess and predict food safety risks. This study proposes a food safety risk prediction method based on brain neural network algorithm. Firstly, the key control points and index factors in the food safety supply chain are analyzed from the perspective of the food supply chain. Then the SOM self-organizing map and the K-means clustering method are used to select the data sets with high aggregation and low coupling to be used as training samples of neural network algorithm. Finally, three kinds of data are verified by BP neural network algorithm. The experimental results show that in food safety risk assessment and prediction, the data processed by two stages have better mean square error convergence, which increases the accuracy of neural network algorithm and improves the prediction effect. It provides a new prediction method for food safety risk prediction, which is of important practical significance. © 2020 Parlar Scientific Publications. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is one of the important problems that has been examined extensively over the past decades. The problem holds a central position within the fields of transportation logistics and supply chain management. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, many researchers have developed several heuristics and metaheuristics to solve the problem. This research proposes a hybrid bat algorithm to solve the VRP. The algorithm employs the Bat algorithm hybridized with a modified kmeans algorithm. The proposed solution technique adopts the methodology of cluster first route second to decompose the original VRP into traveling sales man problems (TSPs) with reduced complexity. Benchmark test instances from the literature are used to prove the efficiency of the proposed hybrid algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.},

We use a Gaussian Mixture Model to represent the probabilities of market prices and, by clustering these probabilities, we identify different economic regimes. We show that the regimes so identified have properties that correlate with market factors that are not directly observable. We then present methods to predict regime changes.

 abstract = {Future market conditions can be a pivotal factor in making business decisions. We present and evaluate methods used by our agent, Deep Maize, to forecast market prices in the Trading Agent Competition Supply Chain Management Game. As a guiding principle we seek to exploit as many sources of available information as possible to inform predictions. Since information comes in several different forms, we integrate well-known methods in a novel way to make predictions. The core of our predictor is a nearest-neighbors machine learning algorithm that identifies historical instances with similar economic indicators. We augment this with an online learning procedure that transforms the predictions by optimizing a scoring rule. This allows us to select more relevant historical contexts using additional information available during individual games. We also explore the advantages of two different representations for predicting price distributions. One uses absolute prices, and the other uses statistics of price time series to exploit local stability. We evaluate these methods using both data from the 2005 tournament final round and additional simulations. We compare several variations of our predictor to one another and a baseline predictor similar to those used by many other tournament agents. We show substantial improvements over the baseline predictor, and demonstrate that each element of our predictor contributes to improved performance. © 2007 IFAAMAS.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the non-linear relationship between a firm’s inventory and sales performance. Specifically, whether there exists an optimal level of inventory that maximizes sales performance is investigated. In order to better understand the effect of supply chain inventories on firm performance, three types of inventories: raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods are separately considered. Analyzing the panel data set of 272 Korean manufacturing firms for the period 1996 to 2012, the following conclusions based on regression methodology has been drawn. After controlling for previous inventory, we find there exists an optimal level of current inventory that maximizes current firm profitability. Furthermore, it is examined whether the external competition level is high using clustering analysis. We find that the effects of supply chain inventories on performance are influenced by the competitive intensity of an industry. The results suggest that while all types of inventories show the non-linear effects on firm performance in the highly competitive market, only finished goods inventory shows significant effects on firm performance in the low competitive market. Our study provides empirical supports for how each type of inventories should be managed and contributes to the extant literature by suggesting managerial implications from a supply-chain perspective perspective for practical engineers and technical professionals. © 2020, © 2020 American Society for Engineering Management.},

 abstract = {Concurrent floods in multiple locations pose systemic risks to the interconnected economy in East Asia via supply chain disruptions. Despite these significant economic impacts, understanding of the interconnection between rainfall patterns in the region is still currently limited. Here, we analyzed the spatial dependence of the rainfall patterns of 24 megacities in the region using complex analysis theory and discussed the technique's applicability. Each city and rainfall similarity were represented by a node and a link, respectively. Vital-node identification and clustering analysis were conducted using adjacency information entropy and multiresolution community detection. The results of vital-node identification analysis show that high-ranking nodes are cities that are located near main vapor providers in East Asia. Using multiresolution community detection, the groups were clustered to reflect the spatial characteristics of the climate. In addition, the climate links between each group were identified using cross-mutual information considering the delay time for each group. We found a strong bond between Northeast China and the southern Indochinese Peninsula and verified that the links between each group originated from the summer climate characteristics of East Asia. The results of the study show that complex network analysis could be a valuable method for analyzing the spatial relationships between climate factors. © Author(s) 2022.},

 abstract = {This research aims to provide important insights regarding the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the world's largest food producing countries based on four sustainability metrics: energy use, carbon footprint, value-added and compensation of employees by low, medium and high-skill groups. World Input-Output Database is used as a detailed and intercountry and sector economic database. To compare the results between global databases, Eora and EXIOBASE are also used for comparative analysis. Three statistical analysis techniques such as Mann-Kendal trend test, matching index and k-means clustering algorithm are applied to provide a further insight from the analysis. The results are presented for three categories: regional on-site, regional supply chain, and global supply chain. The agriculture industry has the largest environmental footprints in food supply chains. Based on the Mann-Kendall trend test, there is a statistically significant trend in carbon, energy, and employment indicators. The maximum value of the matching–index of the overall impact (0.92) is achieved between the EXIOBASE and WIOD databases. China and USA are positioned in different clusters based on total sustainability performance when using different MRIO databases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to intend to help focal firms which are keen to develop a sustainable supply chain by identifying enablers, in knowing the interrelationships involved and in ranking the enablers. Design/methodology/approach: Interpretive structural modeling and fuzzy MICMAC were used for the modeling and clustering of the enablers and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process has been used for the ranking purpose. Findings: Awareness about sustainability incentives, pressure from stakeholders, support from supply chain partners and demand from customer for sustainable products were found very important for developing a sustainable supply chain. Research limitations/implications: This research will help practitioners to appreciate the importance of the enablers to focus on the making sustainability adoption feasible across the supply chain. This would also facilitate focal firm management to develop a sustainability culture across the supply chain. Originality/value: Similar work has not been carried before in which interaction among enablers and their priorities were analyzed using hybrid methodologies in developing country context. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Industries have to integrate environmental, social, and economic aspects into their supply chain management to achieve sustainability. Hence, the industry needs to take appropriate actions in choosing the right suppliers. The aim of this study is to develop a framework for selecting sustainable suppliers by integrating quality management tools using the Kano model, Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process, and Decision Matrix Method. To identify the critical sustainability criteria, the Kano model by the clustering the criteria for sustainable selection supplier was used. We then used the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process to determine the weight of each criterion and applied the Decision Matrix Method to select the most sustainable supplier. Afterward, the appropriate proposed framework was implemented in one of the palm oil industries in Indonesia to validate that the framework is applicable and useful. The study shows that the environmental dimension is the most sustainable supplier criteria followed by economy and social dimension. Quality, pollution control, and information disclosures were found to be important sub-dimensions for sustainable supplier selection. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

 abstract = {Multi-depot capacitated vehicle routing problem is a derivative of vehicle routing problem and a well-known area that has been studied widely with various applications and constraints. Many studies in it focused on minimizing cost and distance with assumption that all nodes are visited. Ironically, number of unserved customers (nodes) in a single trip was rarely explored and often ignored. Based on this problem, this work aims to minimize the total travel distance and the number of unserved customers in single routing cycle. The solution is developed by combining the stable marriage algorithm and k-means clustering in the clustering process. The nearest neighbour algorithm is used in the routing process. This work proposes two contributions. The first is the usage of the stable marriage and k-means clustering. The second is concerning the predetermined distribution of the vehicles in the solution to reduce the number of unserved customers. In the simulation, this proposed model is compared with the hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA), partition-based algorithm-nearest neighbour algorithm (PBA-NN), genetic algorithm-nearest neighbour algorithm (GA-NN) and simulated annealing algorithm (SA). Based on the simulation result, it is found that the proposed model performs moderately as a trade-off between the SA and PBA-NN. In the number of unserved customers aspect, when the number of customers is low, the proposed model creates 71 percent lower than the PBA-NN model. Meanwhile, when the number of customers is high, the proposed model creates 73 percent lower than the PBA-NN model. In the total travel distance aspect, when the number of customers is low (50 persons), the proposed model creates 63 percent higher than the GA-NN model and 48 percent lower than the SA model. Meanwhile, when the number of customers is high (100 customers), the proposed model creates 52 percent higher than the PBA-NN model and 54 percent lower than the SA model. © 2021, International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.

 abstract = {This paper presents a new method for regional energy targeting and supply chain synthesis. The method is based on a novel approach to the optimisation of renewable energy supply. A new algorithm for revealing energy supply chain clusters is introduced, described and illustrated by a case study. It has been developed on two levels. The first is a top-level supply chain network with lowest Carbon Footprint generated. It consists of a number of zone clusters. The definition of zones is provided; it can be e.g. a village or a town. Each zone is considered as a unit. At the second level is a supply chain synthesis carried out by P-graph based optimisation within each cluster. It provides a more detailed analysis. The use of the P-graph framework as a synthesis toolset provides a strong mathematically proven fundament for handling the complexity of the synthesis problem. It contributes to the optimal network design with a high computational efficiency. This approach contributes to the cleaner generation of energy from biomass, approaching CO2 neutrality as much as possible. It is beneficial for extending the use of biomass as a renewable source of energy. © 2010.},

 abstract = {In today's competitive environment, business organizations are forced to maintain their competitive advantage by their ability to cut costs, increase revenue and uncover hidden issues. In order to enhance the visibility and transparency of value added information in a supply chain network, a process mining system is proposed for discovering a set of fuzzy association rules based on the daily captured logistics operation data, within the network. The proposed methodology provides all levels of employees with the ability to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the current business environment. Once interesting association rules have been extracted, organizations can identify the root-causes of quality problems in a supply chain and improve performance by fine-tuning the configuration of process parameters in specified processes. The application of the proposed methodology in a case company has also been studied. The prototype system has been developed and evaluated after performing a spatial analysis. The results obtained indicate that the system is capable of extracting high-quality and actionable information in the case company. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Supply Chain Management is a concept that assumes a business as a chain of inter-connected entities of commercial activities [24]. Therefore, the objective of Supply Chain Management is reducing inventory, lead times and cost at each link under the given constraints. In this paper, we propose a cooperation model for Supply Chain Management using Multi-Agent System. This model constructs a relevant supply chain through iterated matchmaking process. The matchmaking process makes connection between service provider and service requestor for each link of the supply chain [23]. The effective supply chain can be made when each link of the supply chain is connected properly. In order to make a proper connection for each link, this proposed model uses multi-agent system as foundation architecture and uses clustering, rule-based system and neural networks as matching method. With this model, we can make optimum chain connection from the procurement to the customer. © 2004 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this article is to propose a Supply Chain Knowledge Discovery System including Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology together with temporal rule induction that the retailers and distributors can have a better Customer Relationship Management by realising the change of customer purchasing behaviour with latest information. The aim of this research is to identify how information system manipulates the Point-Of-Sales data and customer historical data so as to formulate the cross-selling strategy. With the advert development and application of RFID, the data collected in the linear time interval reveal the characteristics of temporal features of daily transactional data. The proposed system discovers the knowledge by querying data in temporal database interactively and recursively with Temporal Query and Mining Language. Data cleaning process is carried out prior to applying temporal association rule for basket market analysis. The significance of this research is the demonstration of the synergy of using a combination of latest technologies to form an integrated system to improve direct marketing campaign. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

 abstract = {This research presents a systematic and integrated approach that extends the correlated storage assignment strategy to improve the efficiency of warehouse order picking operations. The correlated storage assignment can reduce a significant amount of travel costs, but could lead to traffic congestion due to the imbalanced traffic flow. Hence, this research proposes the correlated and traffic balanced storage assignment (C&TBSA) to minimize the travel time and picking delays, which is modeled in two stages: clustering and assignment. In the clustering stage, a bi-objective optimization model is formulated to group items with the consideration of both travel efficiency and traffic flow balance, which is solved using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). In the assignment stage, items in each cluster are distributed to the available storage locations. C&TBSA is evaluated with an actual warehouse case study and the results show that C&TBSA outperforms random, class-based, and correlated storage assignment methods by 48.74%, 23.82%, and 7.58% respectively, regarding the total time consisting of travel time and picking delays. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {At present, more and more researches are focused on material requirement planning (MRP), which is an important role in supply chain management. In this paper, a new approach for material requirement planning is proposed based on data field and cloud model, which can find out the important materials automatically in supply chain material requirement planning. The clustering method by data field is based on the distribution of equipotential line (surface) of the natural nested data structures in the field and the aggregation properties of self-organization among data objects to achieve the level division. The use of cloud model to describe the characteristics of the concept for clustering results on material requirement planning is not limited by the amount of data and dimension, and it can effectively reflect the clustering the uncertainty of knowledge, especially the randomness and fuzziness. An actual case study and its results analysis are given based on the proposed model. The results show that this approach is effective and feasible in the area of supply chain material requirement planning.},

 abstract = {The current paper presents a comprehensive methodology for supplier selection. In the first stage, the linguistic values expressed as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to assess the weights of the criteria. The Axiomatic Fuzzy Set clustering (AFS) method, which handles ambiguity and fuzziness in the supplier selection problem effectively, is applied to cluster the suppliers and evaluate each potential supplier that aims at obtaining initial supplier ranking. In the second stage, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) model is constructed to determine the weight of various quantitative and qualitative criteria. To address multiple decision criteria in supplier ranking, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is employed to select the final suppliers. A numerical example composed of 30 suppliers and 6 criteria is studied, and the experimental results show that the proposed evaluation framework is suitable for supplier selection decisions even with the dependent criteria/attributes. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

 abstract = {The solution to the Joint Replenishment Problem (JRP) with fuzzy constraint resource was studied by learning algorithm. The fuzzy programming model was constructed to minimize the sum of inventory holding cost, using trapezium fuzzy numbers to represent the fuzzy resource constraints and all of the parameter was given to get the total relevant costs (Tsao Y C. 2014). We solve JRP by unsupervised learning through reinforcement learning, each of the goods’ basic cycle was the initial state. Then, we develop a reinforcement learning algorithm for the JRP with resource restriction. A computational experiment is performed to test the performances of the algorithm. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

 abstract = {Supply chain management first needs to solve the location problem of distribution center of logistics. At present, the application of the centre-of-gravity method to calculate site selection is relative extensive. Based on the method of extreme distance calculation in the field of data mining technology, a new supply chain distribution center selection method combined with clustering algorithm and the centre-of-gravity selection method was proposed in this paper. In order to avoid the limitation of the traditional centre-of-gravity algorithm, the geographical location price was added to the optimization algorithm as the weight value, and the total cost of the model was calculated; then a “three-segment” data mining clustering algorithm was given to improve the efficiency of clustering calculation and avoid isolation finally, the K-means algorithm, the optimized three-segment algorithm and the hierarchical clustering algorithm and so on were compared, and the simulation calculation was carried out. It can be found that the algorithm of clustering center of gravity of the extreme distance data mining can reduce the cost and is advantageous to solve the problem of the location of the supply chain logistics center of gravity location. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {Cold storage is the vital infrastructure of cold chain logistics. In this study, we analyzed the spatial pattern evolution characteristics, spatial autocorrelation and influencing factors of cold storage in China by using kernel density estimation (KDE), spatial autocorrelation analysis (SAA), and spatial error model (SEM). Results showed that: 1) the spatial distribution of cold storage in China is unbalanced, and has evolved from ‘one core’ to ‘one core and many spots’, that is, ‘one core’ refers to the Bohai Rim region mainly including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and Liaoning regions, and ‘many spots’ mainly include the high-density areas such as Shanghai, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Hefei, Wuhan, Ürümqi. 2) The distribution of cold storage has significant global spatial autocorrelation and local spatial autocorrelation, and the ‘High-High’ cluster area is the most stable, mainly concentrated in the Bohai Rim; the ‘Low-Low’ cluster area is grouped in the southern China. 3) Economic developmenficit. © 2020, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {Demand chain management (DCM) can be defined as "extending the view of operations from a single business unit or a company to the whole chain. Essentially, demand chain management focuses not only on generating drawing power from customers to purchase merchandises on the supply chain; but also on exploring satisfaction, participation, and involvement from customers in order for enterprises to understand customer needs and wants. Thus, customers have changed their position in the demand chain to assume a leading role in bringing more benefit for enterprises. This article investigates what functionalities best fit the consumers' needs and wants for life insurance products by extracting specific knowledge patterns and rules from consumers and their demand chain. By doing so, this paper uses the a priori algorithm and clustering analysis as methodologies for data mining. Knowledge extraction from data mining results is illustrated as market segments and demand chain analysis on life insurance market in Taiwan in order to propose suggestions and solutions to the insurance firms for new product development and marketing. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Purpose: Based on prior studies, the performance of customer relationships depends highly on the characteristics of the e-service. However, the strength of this association can be impacted when businesses employ multichannel services (e.g. offering online and offline services). With multichannel services, any inconsistency in perceived quality across channels may result in customer distrust toward a service provider. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of inconsistent quality on the association between e-service quality and customer relationships in a university context. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted a web survey and 318 respondents who have both physical and e-service experiences were collected. The inconsistent quality across channels was divided into three groups by k-means clustering approach. Next, the hypothesized associations were analyzed using regression analysis based on three groups. Findings: The results show that inconsistent quality has different impacts on the association between e-service quality and customer relationships across the three groups. Especially in the positive disconfirmation group, the investment in e-services will be in vain because certain e-service sub-constructs lose their impact on customer relationships. Practical implications: The findings of this study provide implications for improving customer relationships under different cross-channel quality inconsistency conditions for managers. Originality/value: This study extends the concept of expectancy disconfirmation theory to the multichannel service context and pioneers the exploration of the moderating effect of cross-channel quality inconsistency in customer relationships, contributing to the understanding of the literature about the impacts of inconsistent quality on customer relationships. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Association rule is a widely used data mining technique that searches through an entire data set for rules revealing the nature and frequency of relationships or associations between data entities. Supplier selection is a significant work in supply chain management. Often, there will be thousands of potential suppliers and identifying a subset of these suppliers can be a complex process of determining a satisfactory subset based on a number of factors. In this paper, the supplier selection can be viewed as the problem of mining a large database of shipment. The proposed method incorporates the extended association rule algorithm of data mining with that of set theory to find key suppliers. This research has employed a numerical example for the integrated method to develop suitable supplier clusters. The results show that the method is effective and applicable. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Supply chain processes need stability and predictability for the supply to better match demand at the right time with the right quantity. Reaching stable operations under uncertainty, however, is challenging as fluctuating demand patterns in the downstream are so common and make inventory control at the upstream a daunting task. Working with one of the leading semiconductor distributors in the world, who piles up stock that hampers profitability for the sake of satisfying lumpy/erratic demand in the downstream production plants, we help the distributor track process variability in its operations. Specifically, we integrate unsupervised clustering with the recurrent neural network for tracking supply chain process variability without pre-Assumptions on demand patterns. We first apply unsupervised learning techniques to characterize weekly process performance of a wide variety of electronic items, where item-week pairs that have relatively-high similarity on values of demand and stock attributes are clustered together. The operational variability of each item can then be measured with the trajectory of the item on its clusters ordered by time. To predict the trajectory of how each item moves from week to week, we propose a new cluster sequence encoding and employ the recurrent neural network structure for sequence prediction. We show that with a training loss function tailored to our encoding scheme, the presented approach can achieve high accuracy on variability prediction for real-world data. Since any upstream supply operations are driven by downstream demand patterns, the prediction on items' operational variability may help suppliers to better prepare for demand irregularities by dynamically adjusting their operations strategies, e.g., altering throughput rates, rescheduling deliveries, increasing/decreasing fulfillment frequencies, etc. © 2018 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The unlimited growth of supply chain finance data will inevitably lead to a situation in which it is increasingly difficult to access the desired information. Supply chain finance is often necessary to analyze large data sets, maintained over geographically bank, supplier and customer distributed sites by using cooperative context-aware distributed data mining (DDM) systems. The study of the existing approaches shows that no single solution fulfills all requirements identified for the cooperative context-aware DDM systems. One of the basic obstacles is the lack of context-aware and supporting some of the computational resources - such as data and information bases, computational models, compute power to execute these models, specialized data mining algorithms - required to develop a new compound is not available locally, but accessible via the global computing network infrastructure. This paper proposes a multi-agent-based architecture for supply chain finance cooperative distributed data mining systems. The use of multi-agent-systems (MAS) creates a framework which allows the inter-operation of a vast set of heterogeneous solutions to carry out the complex supply chain finance context-aware distributed data mining tasks, many data mining tasks to connect heterogeneous resources, as data sources, processing nodes and end user applications. It considers a data warehousing that supports context-aware OLAP queries, ensuring the interoperability of all data sources, and then focuses on distributed clustering algorithms and some potential applications in multi-agent-based problem solving scenarios. Finally, we outline the implementation of a prototype for shoes manufacturing. © 2008 IEEE.},

 abstract = {As enterprises pay more and more attention to environmental issues, the green supply chain management (GSCM) mode has been extensively utilized to guarantee profit and sustainable development. Green supplier selection (GSS), which is a key segment of GSCM, has been investigated to put forward plenty of GSS approaches. At present, enterprises prefer to construct the large-scale teams of decision makers to obtain the more reasonable ranking results during GSS process. However, the existing methods pay little attention to the large-scale GSS procedure. To investigate the GSS issue with a large-scale group of decision makers, a new GSS approach under a q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy environment is developed. The q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy numbers are introduced to describe the evaluation information of green suppliers. Combined with a clustering approach and several clustering principles, the large-scale decision makers are divided into several subgroups. Next, the similarity measures between the evaluation matrices are computed to determine the weights of subgroups, and the collective evaluation information can be obtained using the q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy aggregation operator. According to the weighted entropy measure, the weights of criteria are calculated; then, the q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form (q-RIVOF-MULTIMOORA) method is constructed to determine the best green supplier. At last, a practical GSS example is applied to show the feasibility of the proposed approach, and the sensitivity and comparative analyses indicate that for the large-scale GSS issues, the proposed approach can obtain the more robust and reasonable ranking results. © 2019 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Object tracking in the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a hot topic over the past ten years. Currently, the integration of video and radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology plays a crucial role in item-level activity recognition. Various techniques and applications have been proposed for visual object tracking. However, identifying semantic features of item-level objects in huge size of video content is a non-trivial task, especially in supply chain management. To alleviate this problem, this paper presents a novel method that applies IoT information to facilitate video summarization. Differing from common video summarization techniques, we use IoT information to select key frames of the video content during the background model establishment. Then we match other key frames with the background to extract important features. Finally, a compact summarization image for queried objects is generated according to a clustering analysis. We have also performed experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed work. © 2014 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the supply chain has become an increasingly pop-ular research topic, but there are little researches on developing countries or emerging market economies as the research object, let alone providing a framework for assessing CSR in sustainable supply chains in the context of these countries. This paper will make up for these literature gaps. From the perspective of the green supply chain management, this paper integrates various authoritative standards and adopts two methods, “R clustering” and “variation coefficient analysis”, to establish a CSR performance evaluation system of China’s transportation industry. Applying the mean square error index weighting method analyzes the performance of 74 companies in China’s transportation industry in 2018 to verify the rationality of the evaluation system. The results find that this industry generally scores low and the performance of responsibilities of different sub‐sectors in this industry is different, but the overall performance trend is improving. This research has impli-cations for China’s transportation industry to improve CSR levels from the perspective of green supply chain management, for managers and stakeholders who are committed to improving China’s CSR green and sustainable development, and for the development of CSR in developing countries and emerging markets. © 2021 by the authors.

 abstract = {Economies are transitioning from a linear to a circular model to address global issues such as resource extraction, environmental degradation and waste generation. Cross-Sector Collaboration (C-SC) is an effective means to use resources in a way that is mutually beneficial and integrates sustainable practices into the value chain. The zero-waste aspiration of companies can be achieved through Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM). Existing literature supports research initiatives in CSCM, but how C-SC influences CSCM is still unexplored. Moreover, the barriers to C-SC for CSCM are untouched and the strategies to overcome these barriers are unmapped. This study fills this gap, assesses the barriers to C-SC for CSCM and suggests a strategic roadmap to overcome these barriers. The study was conducted in three different phases employing a multi-method approach of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC), Fuzzy Delphi and Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL). The results reveal that governance barriers and contextual barriers are causal and influence the other barriers. There is a need to enhance the capacity and optimum resource utilisation for developing circular supply chains; it is possible to facilitate CSCM practices only through collaborative efforts across sectors. The study also highlights that government policymaking and regulation, collaborative value capture model and Industry 4.0 technologies are the most effective strategies for managing C-SC for CSCM. This study contributes to stakeholder theory and resource-based view theory by explicating collaboration among cross-sector stakeholders and highlighting the significance of resource optimisation through waste management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Currently, network perspective is rapidly becoming trends for representing and analyzing problems across all of the domains from natural science to engineering and management, with no exception in supply chain management. Treating supply chain system as a network give a good advantages since there are a lot of method in network theory that can be applied to give a quantitative measurement. In turns, by applying network theory in supply chain, analyst can come up with better description and representation of their supply chain. This study tried explore a concept of community structure in network theory to identify the groups of suppliers, manufactures, distributors, retailers and customer which is highly connected each other and at the same time get a valuable representation of the large supply chain network. We argued that supply chain network is differ from the common network in which the network analysis commonly works onto, thus the method for detecting community will also became different. Hence, in this paper we addressing a method for detecting community of highly connected firms in supply chain/supply chain network by grouping the node/firm based on their complete flow/chain or commodity flow for short. © 2016 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The reliable operation of a logistics service supply chain (LSSC) is a key factor for improving logistics efficiency and service level, and vulnerability is an important indicator of reliable LSSC operation. Based on complex network theory, we reconstructed the running mechanism of logistics service providers, integrators, and demanders. We constructed an improved structure model of LSSC. By observing the selected three indicators (clustering coefficient, maximum connectivity, and network connectivity efficiency), the influence caused by the problem will continue to spread to more subjects along the network when a problem exists in one part of the network. The results showed that the destructive power of deliberate attacks is far greater than the damage caused by random attacks, and the disruption of logistics service integrators will considerably increase the vulnerability of the LSSC. However, even if logistics service integrators are removed completely, the LSSC still can operate at low efficiency. Through a case analysis, we identified the vulnerable nodes in logistics service, clarify the vulnerable mechanism in LSSC, and provide guidance for the operation of LSSC in real life. © 2020 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Today's business environment, survival and making profit in market are the prime requirement for any enterprise due to competitive environment. Innovation and staying updated are commonly identified two key parameters for achieving success and profit in business. Considerably supply chain management is also accountable for profit. As a measure to maximize the profit, supply chain process is to be streamlined and optimized. Appropriate grouping of various suppliers for the benefit of shipment cost reduction is proposed. Data relating to appropriate attributes of supplier logistics are collected. A methodology is proposed to optimize the supplier logistics using clustering algorithm. In the proposed methodology data preprocessing, clustering and validation process have been carried out. The Z-score normalization is used to normalize the data, which converts the data to uniform scales for improving the clustering performance. By employing Hierarchical and K-means clustering algorithms the supplier logistics are grouped and performance of each method is evaluated and presented. The supplier logistics data from different country is experimented. Outcome of this work can help the buyers to select the cost effective supplier for their business requirements. © 2020 SCPE.},

 abstract = {An RFID technology is most important process in supply chain management. In order to know the movements of products in supply chain management, an RFID tag is attached to a product. If the product with an RFID tag moves or stays near the detection region, RFID readers will detect RFID tags information. If the data volume gets increased, the processing of such RFID data becomes complex and hence storing and retrieving data to be very challenging. Nowadays, the RFID data related research works, the complexity reduction on processing such RFID data remains a big challenge. Hence to avoid such negative aspects a new RFID data encoding scheme is proposed in the supply chain management. To reduce the complexity of the processing the RFID data's, or proposed method utilizing orthogonal transformation and optimization model during the raw data processing. Initially, the RFID data to be processed by the orthogonal transformation and that the data's are optimally clustered by the well renowned optimization technique is named as GA. After that, the clustered data's are encoded by exploiting the path encoding and order encoding schemes. Based on the path encoding scheme and the order encoding scheme, we devise a storage scheme that can process tracking queries and path oriented queries efficiently on an RDBMS. Finally, we propose a method that translates the queries to SQL queries. The proposed method is implemented and the queries are efficiently retrieved and the results are compared against the conventional RFID path encoding scheme. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Trajectory data streams are huge amounts of data pertaining to time and position of moving objects. They are continuously generated by different sources exploiting a wide variety of technologies (e.g., RFID tags, GPS, GSM networks). Mining such amount of data is a challenging problem, since the possibility to extract useful information from this peculiar kind of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, hand-off in cellular networks, supply chain management. Moreover, spatial data streams pose interesting challenges for their proper representation, thus making the mining process harder than for classical point data. In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory data streams clustering, that revealed really intriguing as we deal with a kind of data (trajectories) for which the order of elements is relevant. We propose a complete framework starting from data preparation task that allows us to make the mining step quite effective. Since the validation of data mining approaches has to be experimental we performed several tests on real world datasets that confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique. © 2012 ACM.},

 abstract = {For achieving the sustainable consumption and production, designers and manufacturers should provide inexpensive products that create a low environmental load on the user. Accordingly, products and their components should exhibit a modular design, which can be achieved by considering some factors such as future reuse, remanufacturing, and upgrading. Modular design methods primarily focus to reduce the lead time or costs associated with designing an entire family of products. However, resource efficiency is an important consideration associated with reuse as well as with the production and procurement stages of manufacturing. Hence, proper supplier selection is crucial because new products comprise several components and modules supplied by various manufacturers. So, this paper proposes a modular design method and strategy based on supply chain management. Especially, the proposed method evaluates a modular design strategy based on the cost, environmental load in transportation, quality, and procurement lead time. After deriving modular architecture candidates by Design Structure Matrix clustering that divide functionally closer parts into groups, a proposed indicator is used to evaluate the efficiency of the candidates based on the modular architectures and suppliers. This study applies the proposed method to design a laptop computer and derives an appropriate modular architecture and suppliers with respect to each destination. © 2019 Penerbit Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.},

@article{Mokhtarinejad2015274,
 abstract = {One of the most important problem in supply chain management is the design of distribution systems which can reduce the transportation costs and meet the customer's demand at the minimum time. In recent years, cross-docking (CD) centers have been considered as the place that reduces the transportation and inventory costs. Meanwhile, neglecting the optimum location of the centers and the optimum routing and scheduling of the vehicles mislead the optimization process to local optima. Accordingly, in this research, the integrated vehicle routing and scheduling problem in cross-docking systems is modeled. In this new model, the direct shipment from the manufacturers to the customers is also included. Besides, the vehicles are assigned to the cross-dock doors with lower cost. Next, to solve the model, a novel machine-learning-based heuristic method (MLBM) is developed, in which the customers, manufacturers and locations of the cross-docking centers are grouped through a bi-clustering approach. In fact, the MLBM is a filter based learning method that has three stages including customer clustering through a modified bi-clustering method, sub-problems' modeling and solving the whole model. In addition, for solving the scheduling problem of vehicles in cross-docking system, this paper proposes exact solution as well as genetic algorithm (GA). GA is also adapted for large-scale problems in which exact methods are not efficient. Furthermore, the parameters of the proposed GA are tuned via the Taguchi method. Finally, for validating the proposed model, several benchmark problems from literature are selected and modified according to new introduced assumptions in the base models. Different statistical analysis methods are implemented to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is one of the most popular routing problems. In the CVRP, a fleet of capacitated vehicles located at a central depot are used to deliver products to a set of geographically dispersed customers with known demand. In this work, a new two-step approach to solve the CVRP with a heterogeneous fleet is proposed. In the first step; a balanced K-means clustering algorithm is used to aggregate the customers into balanced clusters. In the second step, clusters are assigned to vehicles and a MIP model is solved with adding valid inequalities that are used to reduce the volume of the mathematical model. Then the problem is disaggregated to find the detailed tours for each vehicle. The proposed approach was used to solve benchmark problems from literature, and it proved its efficiency in terms of quality, vehicle utilization, and computational time. The contribution of this work is combining the clustering algorithm with cutting techniques in order to find near-optimal solutions within reasonable computational times. © IEOM Society International.},

 abstract = {This article aims to measure the integrated performance of the supply chain in a new perspective. A new model called PEMMcopula has been built, which can effectively measure the integrated performance and provide quantitative proofs for supply chain financing decisions. PEM-Mcopula model is built based on the penalty function and mixed copula function, using SCAD penalty function to recognize the non-significant copula. Two step parameter estimation is used, the first step is kernel density estimation on marginal distribution, and EM method is used for estimating the weight and dependent parameters in iteration in the second step. And an empirical analysis of auto industry is also included. The model can effectively measure the integrated performance and provide quantitative proofs for supply chain financing decision and risk control, which is an excellent quantitative model to make integrated performance evaluation and provide a new perspective for supply chain financing business of banks and other financial institutions. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

 abstract = {Mass customization is an important strategy to improve production systems to satisfy customers' preferences while maintaining production efficiency for mass production. Module production is one of the ways to achieve mass customization, and products are produced by combining modules. In the module production, it becomes much more important for manufacturing companies to reflect customers' preferences for selling products. The manufacturer can increase its total profit by providing customized products that satisfy customers' preferences by increasing customers' satisfaction. In conventional production planning, there are some cases where module production is conducted by the demands from customers' preferences. However, the customer decision-making model has not been employed in the production planning model. In this paper, a production planning model incorporating customers' preferences is developed. The customers' purchasing behavior is generated by using a machine learning model. Customer segmentation is conducted by clustering data that uses the purchase data of multiple customers. The resulting production planning model is a bilevel production planning problem consisting of a single company and multiple customers. Each company can sell products that combine modules that customers require in each segment. We show that the proposed model can obtain higher customers' satisfaction with greater profits than the model that does not employ the customers' purchasing model. © 2022 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

In most IoT applications, for various reasons, a collected data set may include incorrect or corrupted data samples, which should be detected and removed. For example, malicious devices may send fake information or malfunctioned remote devices can respond improperly. In this paper, we study anomaly detection for wireless links, not data sets sent by devices, to see any anomalies in the physical and link layers associated with connected devices to a network. The resulting approach can be viewed as preemptive anomaly detection and be part of causal anomaly discovery that helps determine whether anomalies detected in a data set are caused by errors in wireless links or transceivers. © 2021 APSIPA.},

 abstract = {Making appropriate decisions is indeed a key factor to help companies facing challenges from supply chains nowadays. In this paper, we propose two data-driven approaches that allow making better decisions in supply chain management. In particular, we suggest a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network-based method for forecasting multivariate time series data and an LSTM Autoencoder network-based method combined with a one-class support vector machine algorithm for detecting anomalies in sales. Unlike other approaches, we recommend combining external and internal company data sources for the purpose of enhancing the performance of forecasting algorithms using multivariate LSTM with the optimal hyperparameters. In addition, we also propose a method to optimize hyperparameters for hybrid algorithms for detecting anomalies in time series data. The proposed approaches will be applied to both benchmarking datasets and real data in fashion retail. The obtained results show that the LSTM Autoencoder based method leads to better performance for anomaly detection compared to the LSTM based method suggested in a previous study. The proposed forecasting method for multivariate time series data also performs better than some other methods based on a dataset provided by NASA. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In this research, we analyze the locational data of hospital using a case study of hospitals in Thailand to evaluate potential locational center acting as a central storage and distribution centers. Initially, we apply the K-means algorithm to classify hospital locational data into a specified number of classification groups. Then, the location model based on rectilinear distance is formulated and minimized to evaluate potential locations for the central storage and distribution centers.

 abstract = {Vendor selection is a strategic issue in supply chain management for any organization to identify the right supplier. Such selection in most cases is based on the analysis of some specific criteria. Most of the researches so far concentrate on multi-criteria decisionmaking analysis. Though many approaches have been proposed, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is the most well known as it can deal with a very complex criteria structure. In AHP, the selected criteria are ranked and organized in a hierarchical order from generic to specific to formulate the problem. Though this order of ranking is acceptably logical, it incurs a huge computational complexity when a large number of alternatives are considered as the selection criteria. Moreover, the AHP may generate wrong selection due to computational error. To address these limitations, a novel model namely vendor selection using fuzzy c-means algorithm and analytic hierarchy process (VFA) is presented in this paper by integrating the fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm with analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The outcome of the proposed VFA algorithm is compared with the basic AHP algorithm and VFA outperforms the basic AHP and reduces the computational complexity of AHP by a factor of 7. ©2009 IEEE.},

 abstract = {In this work, we present a new approach to solve the Capacitated Location-Routing Problem (CLRP). The aim of this method is to determine the depot locations, to assign customers to facilities and to define routes for each depot to serve the associated clients. The proposed approach contains two phases, which are the constructive phase and the improvement phase. In the first phase, we select the depots to be opened, allocate the customers to open depots using a Hierarchical Ascendant (HA) method and we solve the vehicle routing problem for each depot using Sweep algorithm. In the second phase, we apply a Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) with three structures in order to optimize the cost obtained by the first phase. Two sets of well-known instances from the literature are used to evaluate the performance of this method, and the numerical results obtained are compared with the experimental results of other methods. Results show that our method is competitive with respect to the best-known solutions (BKSs) and demonstrate its efficiency in comparison with other approaches. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

 abstract = {Food needs are rising as the world's population grows. Similarly, the food processing industry is growing at an accelerated pace. Reduced food waste, better supply chain management, and increased delivery and storage of food are urgently required. These goals can be achieved to a large part with the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. When a computer software can learn to anticipate future events without being programmed, it is known as machine learning. Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two of the most common subcategories of machine learning. In this post, we'll look at how AI and machine learning are being used in the food and agricultural sector. Supply chain optimization, crop selection, logistics, food delivery, maintenance prediction in food processing machinery, detection of crop disease, smart irrigation, crop yield prediction, tracking of perishable food, soil data analysis, and weather data analysis are all major applications. © 2022 IEEE.},

Game relations among the government, the owners of the logistics centers, and the clients were discussed by system analysis method. The synthetic evaluation indices of 17 characteristic vectors were established for clients to select the logistics centers and exchanging amount. The problem is equal to that of determining the membership values to the given logistics centers or the clustering centers by using the thought of fuzzy c-means clustering. The clustering centers are some of the feasible sites that possess candidacy of the logistics centers. Stackelberg model was established.

 abstract = {Purpose: Reverse logistics (RL), an inseparable aspect of supply chain management, returns used products to recovery processes with the aim of reducing waste generation. Enterprises, however, seem reluctant to apply RL due to various types of risks which are perceived as posing an economic threat to businesses. This paper draws on a synthesis of supply chain and risk management literature to identify and cluster RL risk factors and to recommend risk mitigation strategies for reducing the negative impact of risks on RL implementation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors identify and cluster risk factors in RL by using risk management theory. Experts in RL and supply chain risk management validated the risk factors via a questionnaire. An unsupervised data mining method, self-organising map, is utilised to cluster RL risk factors into homogeneous categories. Findings: A total of 41 risk factors in the context of RL were identified and clustered into three different groups: strategic, tactical and operational. Risk mitigation strategies are recommended to mitigate the RL risk factors by drawing on supply chain risk management approaches. Originality/value: This paper studies risks in RL and recommends risk management strategies to control and mitigate risk factors to implement RL successfully. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {The adoption of omni-channel strategy has changed the relation between retailers and customers and brought more complexity to the retailing supply chains. To address the increasing complexity, it is necessary to adopt innovative approaches based on information technologies and intelligent decision methods. The challenges to retailers are improving the accuracy of offline and online channels demand forecasting, better managing offline and online customer's needs, thus reducing the uncertainties of the omni-channel retailing supply chain. In this context, this research paper aims to propose a predictive approach for omni-channel retailing supply chain combining clustering with artificial neural network to handle demand uncertainty. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {The methods to select supply chain partners for a corporation is very important, especially for the complicated supply chain network with hundreds of members and multilevel structure, and the increasingly developing of evaluation criteria. According to the situation, we propose RVPK algorithm based on PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and K-means clustering. The method is applied on clustering of supply chain partners selection, which shows that the RVPK has stronger searching ability, better stability and higher precision compared with related methods. The corporation could discover the potential partners by the advantages or the characters of corporations in the clusters according to the results and decide the primary supply chain partners. © 2008 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Supply chain management (SCM) is concerned with the movement of products, services, and information from points of origin to consumers via a network of interconnected organizations and activities. It is believed that capacity, demand, and cost are well-known variables in typical SCM challenges. In practice, however, there are uncertainties brought on by changes in client demand, supply chain management, organizational risks, and lead times. Demand uncertainty in particular has a significant impact on SC performance with wide-ranging implications for scheduling production, planning inventories, and organizing transportation. In this regard, demand forecasting is a crucial strategy for tackling supply chain uncertainty. Forecasting supply chain demand using big data analytics has been published in the supervised and unsupervised learning categories. In supervised learning, the inputs and outputs are known because the data are tagged with labels. Given a fresh unlabeled dataset, the supervised learning algorithms attempt to map the inputs to matching outputs by identifying the underlying connections between the inputs and outputs. The main motive for the authors is to prove that supply chain can be managed through machine learning and to get a novel accuracy along with comparison of the machine learning models. © 2022 IEEE.},

@article{Rizwan2022,
 abstract = {Recent technological developments indicate possible advancements in supply chain management (SCM). These innovations have attracted a lot of interest from industries including logistics, manufacturing, packaging, and transportation. The conventional systems, however, use centralised servers to control all operations, including the exchange of raw materials, making orders, dealing with buyers and sellers, and updating orders. The network's supply chain may thus be insecure as a result of every activity being routed via centralised servers. The danger is additionally increased by a number of difficulties, including scalability, data integrity, security, and availability. Block chain technology may be used in these circumstances to decentralise transaction processing and eliminate the need for a centralised controller. In this approach, the performance of the resource-constrained supply chain network is improved by the effective use of edge computing and priority data access. The Intelligent K-Means (IKM) clustering algorithm is suggested across the edge nodes in the current research to categorise the priority level of each piece of data. This classifier determines if the edge node has received data that is high priority or low priority. Low priority data is recorded in the log files for future data analysis. Then, to allow safe data flow in the open block chain while excluding outside parties, the High Priority Access based Smart Contract (HPASC) technique is deployed. The whole experiment was conducted in a Python environment, and variables including scalability, reaction time, throughput, and accuracy were studied. Current systems' constrained block sizes and fork creation lengthen the time transactions must wait before being processed. The suggested methodology is quicker and uses less storage space than current block chain systems. The results show that the suggested approach works better than current blockchain technology to raise the standard of supply chain management. © 2022 Ali Rizwan et al.},

 abstract = {The continuously growing amount of available data has accelerated the emergence of numerous business intelligence applications that are summarized under the term Big Data Analytics (BDA). BDA is especially relevant to the domain of Supply Chain Management (SCM) as it provides the tools to support decision-making in increasingly global, volatile and dynamic value networks. However, its application challenges traditional institutional arrangements as well as roles that are related to the management of data. The underlying empirical study addresses this challenge with the application of a multi-method approach that is embedded in Organizational Information Processing Theory (OIPT). A Delphi survey was conducted to integrate expert assessments of projections up to the year 2035 and fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to identify future scenarios that span the future of BDA in SCM. The study suggests that BDA will improve demand forecasts, reduce safety stocks and improve the management of supplier performance. However, supply chain (SC) processes will become increasingly automated and traditional tasks of SCM will be partially substituted as a result. Consequently, the transition of the traditional role of SCM within organizations will increase the importance of human intuition, trust and strategic decision-making. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {Supply chain management is monitoring of activities involved in supply chain, for integrating and coordinating between suppliers, manufacturing, inventory and transportation both within and among members. The ultimate aim of supply chains is to reduce costs and increase market coverage. Procuring and purchasing requested items in a timely manner are the two most important issues for supply chain stockholders. Group purchasing is one of the purchasing strategies in supply chains. It offers great potential by ordering large volumes to decrease expenses which can increase services to customers. A clustering optimization approach is employed to model group purchasing for a set of pharmacies in the field of healthcare. The proposed model determines a cooperation strategy based on factors such as distance between pharmacies and procurement expenditure in this network. Moreover, the proposed multi-objective group purchasing model is optimized using both goal programming and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. To illustrate the application of the proposed model, designing a purchasing group organization for Chalus city pharmacies is investigated. Purchasing groups are established in the way that sum of pharmacies ordering quantity has been located in the second or the third level of discount rate. Thus, the results show that GPOs can take the advantage of this cooperation. © 2017, SBMAC - Sociedade Brasileira de Matemática Aplicada e Computacional.},

 abstract = {The Industry 4.0, when it comes into effect, will essentially transform supply chain management, action plans and business procedures [1]. However, a major challenge to the process of product design and development rests upon how flexible a production in a batch can be, and how to maintain the economic conditions of mass production in the same time [2]. This study aims to develop an automatic system that shows the potential of designing a product form by co-designing with the user. Artificial Intelligent techniques will be applied with Kansei engineering system in order to use as an ingenious product co-design system. First, supervised back propagation neural network (BPNN) will be co-operated with the genetic algorithm technique to optimize each design element value from Kansei engineering system. Then, the style and preference of each user will be used as a categorizing factor clustering the database into groups with K-mean technique. Each classifying cluster will use its own database in the system processing in order to obtain a set of precise design elements precisely based on the system. Moreover, the system acquires user’s feedback as well as the preference cluster to revise its KE system formula. This project will apply the cross-validation as an unbiased model performance evaluation. The genuine use of this system will bring the benefit to the manufacturers by saving the lead time when their product is put on the market, and consequently ensure customers’ satisfaction with the product form. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

 abstract = {Since most supply chain processes include operational risks, the effectiveness of a corporation’s success depends mainly on identifying, analyzing and managing them. Currently, supply chain risk management (SCRM) is an active research field for enhancing a corporation’s efficiency. Although several techniques have been proposed, they still face a big challenge as they analyze only internal risk events from big data collected from the logistics of supply chain systems. In this paper, we analyze features that can identify risk labels in a supply chain. We propose defining risk events based on the association rule mining (ARM) technique that can categorize those in a supply chain based on a company’s historical data. The empirical results we obtained using data collected from an Aluminum company showed that this technique can efficiently generate and predict the optimal features of each risk label with a higher than 96.5% accuracy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

 abstract = {Purpose: The COVID-19 crisis has shown that the global supply chains are not as resilient as expected. First investigations indicate that the main contributing factor is a lack of visibility into the supply chain's lower tiers. Simultaneously, the willingness to share data in the supply chain is low as companies mainly consider their data as proprietary. However, large amounts of data are available on the internet. The amount of this data is steadily increasing; however, the problem remains, that this data is hardly structured. Therefore, this paper investigates current approaches to use this data for supply chain transparency and derives further research directions. Methodology: The paper uses a systematic review of the literature followed by content analysis. The research process further follows established frameworks in the literature and is subdivided into distinct stages. Findings: Descriptive and clustering results show a fragmented research field, where current approaches disconnect from prior research. We classify the methods using a simple taxonomy and show developments from rule-based to supervised techniques and horizontal to vertical mining approaches. The techniques with rule-based-matching procedures mainly suffer from low recall. The current approaches do not satisfy yet essential requirements on supply chain mapping based on natural language. Originality: To the best of the authors' knowledge, no prior research has been attempted to review textual data usage for supply chain mapping. Therefore, this paper's main contribution is to fill this gap and add further evidence to the use of data-driven supply chain management methods. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {In this paper the analysis of two multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods for sorting suppliers in industrial environments is presented. The MCDM methods correspond to Electre and FlowSort and both are applied to the classification of providers in an actual case of the local softdrink bottling industry in Chile. The results show that Electre as an outranking method it may well classify suppliers in a similar manner as FlowSort does. Nevertheless, due to the intrinsic underlying fuzzy multicriteria nature of the problem, FlowSort is found to be more suitable method for building a rule-based system based on preference functions for automating the process of suppliers clustering when developing strategies of relationship management in the sense of the Kraljic categories in supply chain management. © 2006-2015 by CCC Publications.},

 abstract = {Big data analytics (BDA) in supply chain management (SCM) is receiving a growing attention. This is due to the fact that BDA has a wide range of applications in SCM, including customer behavior analysis, trend analysis, and demand prediction. In this survey, we investigate the predictive BDA applications in supply chain demand forecasting to propose a classification of these applications, identify the gaps, and provide insights for future research. We classify these algorithms and their applications in supply chain management into time-series forecasting, clustering, K-nearest-neighbors, neural networks, regression analysis, support vector machines, and support vector regression. This survey also points to the fact that the literature is particularly lacking on the applications of BDA for demand forecasting in the case of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) and accordingly highlights avenues for future research. © 2020, The Author(s).},

 abstract = {Unique features of solar energy, such as the low cost of operation and low pollution, make photovoltaic power plants attractive. Despite the advantages of these power plants, such as low cost of operation and operating without pollution, their high establishment cost compared to that of the conventional fossil fuel-fired power plants prevents their rapid growth. Therefore, designing and optimizing an efficient supply chain network will help to develop the photovoltaic industry. This study proposes a bi-objective model to design and optimize a thin-film photovoltaic power plant supply chain network integrating reverse logistics. The first objective minimizes the costs of supply chain network design, which optimizes decisions from suppliers to disposal centers. The second objective maximizes the efficiency of the data envelopment analysis model to find suitable locations of facilities. As there is uncertainty in electricity demand prediction and perfect foresight is not possible, a fuzzy-robust programming approach is devised to cope with the uncertain parameters. The validity and practicality of the proposed approach are investigated by a case study based on real-world data. Finally, K-Means clustering is incorporated into the model to analyze the installed photovoltaic capacity of different cities in each period. The results show that using an optimistic approach to deal with uncertainty reduces the total cost by 20% in comparison with using a pessimistic approach. The results also provide helpful insights for decision-makers and policymakers in allocating and optimizing the operation of facilities by considering the real-world characteristics of the candidate locations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The 3S-FSM model involves a novel approach to creating a new paradigm of supply chain management, called e-service supply chain management. Specifically, the proposed model focuses on implementing integrated condition-based maintenance (CBM) and intelligent field service scheduling solutions in four areas: (1) prognostic CBM capabilities enabled by data mining, (2) pre-scheduling service territory and field service planning by mathematical programming and service job clustering techniques, (3) multi-criteria field service scheduling and post-scheduling systems learning using fuzzy logic, and (4) web-centric information sharing and knowledge management for enhancing service supply chain performance and integrating and streamlining the entire supply chain operations.},

 abstract = {Purpose: Through examining the two constructs of inter-organizational complementarity and inter-organizational compatibility in supply chains, the purpose of this paper is to develop a taxonomy of focal firms’ inter-organizational fit (IOF) configurations with their suppliers and customers, and examine the relationship between these configurations and environmental innovation (EI) in order to answer the question of “with whom” to collaborate for EI development. Design/methodology/approach: A survey instrument was elaborated and data from a sample of 171 US firms were collected. The authors adopted cluster analysis to identify the IOF taxonomy. Canonical discriminant analysis was employed to uncover underlying dimensions between clustering variables and cluster membership. Then, ANOVA tests were conducted to investigate relationships between IOF configurations in the context of EI in supply chains. Findings: Three configurations were identified based on the complementarity and compatibility between focal firms and their supply chain partners. It is observed that the overall IOF level is positively related to firms’ EI outcomes. Moreover, inter-organizational complementarity facilitates incremental EI while inter-organizational compatibility plays a more crucial role in radical EI. Both are required to achieve the best innovation outcome. Originality/value: This research develops the first taxonomy for depicting IOF in a supply chain innovation context and also clarifies different rationale behind the development of incremental and radical EI through examining distinctive effects of the complementarity and compatibility with supply chain partners. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Rogue seasonality or unintended cyclic variability in order and other supply chain variables is an endogenous disturbance generated by a companys internal processes such as inventory and production control systems. The ability to automatically detect, diagnose and discriminate rogue seasonality from exogenous disturbances is of prime importance to decision makers. This paper compares the effectiveness of alternative time series techniques based on Fourier and discrete wavelet transforms, autocorrelation and cross correlation functions and autoregressive model in detecting rogue seasonality. Rogue seasonalities of various intensities were generated using different simulation designs and demand patterns to evaluate each of these techniques. An index for rogue seasonality, based on the clustering profile of the supply chain variables was defined and used in the evaluation. The Fourier transform technique was found to be the most effective for rogue seasonality detection, which was also subsequently validated using data from a steel supply network. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the B2B e-commerce (B2BEC) usage patterns of North American small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their supply chains, the contextual factors that influence usage patterns, and the subsequent effects of these patterns on firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted an online survey of North American SMEs and obtained 229 responses. They utilized several statistical methods, including cluster analysis and profile analysis, to test five hypotheses. Findings - The TOE framework, supplemented with interorganizational factors, provides a valid theoretical guideline to study firms' B2BEC usage patterns. Three distinct types of B2BEC usage patterns - E-Limiteds, E-Leaders, and E-Laggards - emerged. Different sets of contextual factors contribute to the formation of these three patterns of B2BEC adoption. Higher levels of B2BEC usage result in stronger firm performance. Research limitations/implications - Future clustering variables could be more specific. The effects of other potential contextual factors should also be explored by future studies. This study can be replicated in other countries to determine whether the findings can be generalized. Practical implications - In light of the potential performance improvements that B2BEC adoption offers, managers should assess the risks associated with maintaining their current speed of e-business deployment versus the risks associated with escalating it. Organizations that have been more reactive should consider how well or ill their sluggish approach prepares them for navigating the inevitability of increasing sophistication in supply chain management. Originality/value - Limited empirical research exists on theB2BECusage patterns of NorthAmerican SMEs, the contextual factors that motivate them to adopt different B2BEC technologies in their supply chains, and how each of these usage patterns affects their performance. The current study contributes to the literature by shedding light on these issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a big-data analytics-based approach that considers social media (Twitter) data for the identification of supply chain management issues in food industries. In particular, the proposed approach includes text analysis using a support vector machine (SVM) and hierarchical clustering with multiscale bootstrap resampling. The result of this approach included a cluster of words which could inform supply-chain (SC) decision makers about customer feedback and issues in the flow/quality of food products. A case study in the beef supply chain was analysed using the proposed approach, where three weeks of data from Twitter were used. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Customers benefit from the ability to select their desired options to configure final products. Manufacturing companies, however, struggle with the dilemma of product diversity and manufacturing complexity. It is important, therefore, for them to capture correlations among the options provided to the customers. In this paper, a data mining approach is applied to manage product diversity and complexity. Rules are extracted from historical sales data and used to form sub-assemblies as well as product configurations. Methods for discovering frequently ordered product sub-assemblies and product configurations from 'if-then' rules are discussed separately. The development of the sub-assemblies and configurations allows for effective management of enterprise resources, contributes to the innovative design of new products, and streamlines manufacturing and supply chain processes. The ideas introduced in this paper are illustrated with examples and an industrial case study.},

 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify a classification scheme which represents the variation in business and supply chain performance of supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry. Classification is done by presenting an empirical taxonomy of clusters representing supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry based on variation in supply chain excellence index (SCEI) and business performance index (BPI). Design/methodology/approach: The clustering of supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry is done by considering BPI and SCEI as clustering variables, which were found by using survey responses and results of a prior empirical study which was carried out in Indian manufacturing industry. The cluster analysis is performed by using Ward’s agglomerative hierarchical clustering followed by using K-means clustering algorithm to establish final set of clusters. Findings: It was found that supply chains in Indian manufacturing industries can be clustered in four major clusters which are named as strategic, celebrity, capable and undeveloped cluster. The characteristics of these clusters reveal some major characteristics of supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry. Originality/value: The research work presented in this paper takes a novel way to introduce the clusters of supply chains in Indian manufacturing industry. The researchers who are seeking patterns in large data sets of manufacturing companies of Indian industry will be benefitted by using the proposed clusters. While practitioners who are seeking to move their supply chain one step ahead will also reap the benefits of the paper by seeking the characteristics of particular cluster. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the management of the products and goods flow from its origin point to point of consumption. During the process of SCM, information and dataset gathered for this application is massive and complex. This is due to its several processes such as procurement, product development and commercialization, physical distribution, outsourcing and partnerships. For a practical application, SCM datasets need to be managed and maintained to serve a better service to its three main categories; distributor, customer and supplier. To manage these datasets, a structure of data constellation is used to accommodate the data into the spatial database. However, the situation in geospatial database creates few problems, for example the performance of the database deteriorate especially during the query operation. We strongly believe that a more practical hierarchical tree structure is required for efficient process of SCM. Besides that, three-dimensional approach is required for the management of SCM datasets since it involve with the multi-level location such as shop lots and residential apartments. 3D R-Tree has been increasingly used for 3D geospatial database management due to its simplicity and extendibility. However, it suffers from serious overlaps between nodes. In this paper, we proposed a partition-based clustering for the construction of a hierarchical tree structure. Several datasets are tested using the proposed method and the percentage of the overlapping nodes and volume coverage are computed and compared with the original 3D R-Tree and other practical approaches. The experiments demonstrated in this paper substantiated that the hierarchical structure of the proposed partitionbased clustering is capable of preserving minimal overlap and coverage. The query performance was tested using 300,000 points of a SCM dataset and the results are presented in this paper. This paper also discusses the outlook of the structure for future reference.},

 abstract = {Due to the intensely increasing individualized and rapidly changing demand in global market, customer oriented design has been the top priority for modern enterprises to quickly respond to the volatile personalized requirements. This leads to the great change of mass customization in supply chain management, in which the agility, efficiency and cost have become the main impediment to improve supply chain's performance. In this paper, we first propose a new method of adaptive clustering for the orientation and analysis of target customers that is originally inspired from the swarm intelligence of ant colony, then the recommendation system for the design of LCD-TV is illustrated that applied by this method to test the validity of the algorithm. After that, we present a supply chain management based on mobile agents to satisfy the customization, especially, detailed description of the agentbased supply chain process is also expounded. Finally, an integrated intelligent system to support the customer oriented design as well as its supply chain management is discussed. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

@article{Susanty20201336,
 abstract = {Despite the growing awareness about Circular Economy (CE) in production and supply chain management, there is little evidence linking CE practices to environmental and economic performances, especially within the traditional wood furniture industry in Indonesia. As with other management practices, implementation of CE can be supported by various factors. Among these factors are the so-called environmental-oriented supply chain cooperation (ESCC) practices. The study reported in this paper has three purposes. First, to investigate how the different levels of ESCC practices will affect the CE practices across the traditional wooden furniture industry in Central Java, Indonesia; second, to investigate the relationship between varying ESCC practices (which is grouped based on the implementation of CE practices) on the CE-targeted performances; and third, to examine the role of ESCC practices as a moderating variable in the relationship between CE practices and CE-targeted performances. This study uses primary data which were collected through closed questionnaires to 190 valid samples of wooden furniture SMEs across the cities of Jepara, Kudus, Rembang, Semarang, Blora and Surakarta. The data were processed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), K-means clustering analysis, Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and regression analysis. The results indicated that, depending on the levels of ESCC practices, the SMEs could be grouped into leaders, followers and laggard, which also determined the extent to which they practised the CE principles. The study also elaborated on the interactions between ESCC and CE practices, and how these might affect the CE-targeted environmental and economic performances. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

 abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the role and main attributes of manufacturing companies which operate in virtual supply chains. Design/methodology/approach - In order to identify the role and main attributes of manufacturing companies enabling to operate in a virtual supply chain, a three-step statistical analysis was employed, namely exploratory factor analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and non-hierarchical clustering technique. Findings - The findings show that virtual supply chain operations would not be supported by manufacturing companies offering highly customized products achieved by a unit production, developed in details and engineered to order. On the contrary, the large manufacturing companies of virtual supply chains report a high level of flexibility stemming from a wide scope of more standardized products offered to the market. The conducted study show that better ability of manufacturers supporting virtual supply chains is not industry specific. Research limitations/implications - The list of investigated attributes is not complete, and other characteristics of manufacturers in virtual supply chains should be identified. Another important shortcoming of the study is its quantitative character and generalization of the findings. Each "virtual" environment in supply chains may be unique and some of the compared characteristics may differ significantly. Therefore, the aforementioned attributes should be considered separately with a conscious focus on the environmental context. The quantitative study may be greatly enhanced by applying the case study approach, showing detailed solutions and practices, and thus making the study more valuable from the theoretical and managerial standpoints. Practical implications - The conducted study showed that better ability of manufacturers to support virtual supply chains is not industry specific, since the branch of electronic products and electrical equipment and components was represented by an equal share of manufacturers, both in non-virtual and virtual clusters. Furthermore, in order to operate in virtual supply chains, managers should pay attention to the structure and range of products delivered to the market. The managers should also be aware that apart from considering cost and efficiency, operating in a virtual supply chain environment also requires quality of products and processes in order to manufacture and deliver a superior value for the customers. Originality/value - Having recognized major groups of indicators demonstrating the level of ability of manufacturing companies to operate in a virtual supply chain, the attributes of three clusters of manufacturers possessing different bunch of features, significant for virtual supply chains, have been distinguished. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {In recent years, manufacturing processes have become more and more complex, manufacturing activities generate large quantities of data, so it is no longer practical to rely on traditional manual methods to analyze this data. Data mining offers tools for extracting knowledge from data, leading to significant improvement in the decision-making process. Association rules mining is one of the most important data mining techniques and has received considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. The paper presents the basic concept of association rule mining and reviews applications of association rules in manufacturing, including product design, manufacturing, process, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and product quality improvement. This paper is focused on demonstrating the relevancy of association rules mining to manufacturing industry, rather than discussing the association rules mining domain in general. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.},

@article{Tanaka2019,
 abstract = {Given the rapid diversification of products in the textile and apparel industry, manufacturers face significant new challenges in production. The life cycle of apparel products has contracted and is now, generally, a several-week season, during which time a majority of products are supposed to be sold. Products that do not sell well may be sold at a price lower than the fixed price, and products that do not sell at all within the sales period may eventually become forced disposal. This creates long-term management and environmental problems. In practice, shipping personnel determine when to ship products to stores after reviewing product sales information. However, they may not schedule or structure these shipments properly because they cannot effectively monitor sales for a large number of products. In this paper, shipment is considered to reduce the risk of product disposal on the premise of selling at a fixed price. Although shipment quantities are determined by various factors, we only consider the change in inventory at the logistics warehouse, since it is difficult to incorporate all factors into the analysis. From cluster analysis, it is found that shipping personnel should recognize a policy to sell products gradually over time. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of disposal, we forecast the inventory from conditional probability and are able to extract products out of a standard grouping using past data. © 2018 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Optimal inventory control is one of the significant tasks in supply chain management. The optimal inventory control methodologies intend to reduce the supply chain (SC) cost by controlling the inventory in an effective manner, such that, the SC members will not be affected by surplus as well as shortage of inventory. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach that effectively utilizes the Data Mining (DM) concepts as well as Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimal inventory control. The proposed approach consists of two major functions, mining association rules for inventory and selecting SC cost-impact rules. Initially, the association rules are mined from EMA-based inventory data, which is determined from the original historical data. Apriori, a classic data mining algorithm is utilized for mining association rules from EMA-based inventory data. Later, with the aid of genetic algorithm, SC cost-impact rules are selected for every SC member. The obtained SC cost-impact rules will possibly signify the future state of inventory in any SC member. Moreover, the level of holding or reducing the inventory can be determined from the SC cost-impact rules. Thus, the SC cost-impact rules that are derived using the proposed approach greatly facilitate optimal inventory control and hence make the supply chain management more effective.},

A great amount of uncertainties with the supply chain and demand and the globalization of the market in a complex international supply chain network relationship have led to higher exposure to risks in the supply chain. In this paper, we have developed a model of a knowledge-based supply chain risk management system which includes four modules: basic database management, supply chain risk early warnings and risk management strategies module. We analyze the basis process of knowledge-based supply chain risk management which includes four steps: knowledge collection, knowledge discovery, knowledge sharing and knowledge study. Finally, we defined three simple association rules application to the supply chain risk management. © 2014 ISSN 1881-803X.},

 abstract = {This study combined the input-output clustering analysis and structural path betweenness analysis, and identified critical sectors belonging to important emission clusters in the global supply chain networks associated with final demand of transport equipment in five countries (United States, China, Germany, Japan, and France). Clustering analysis can divide the groups constructing the strong connecting supply chain with large emissions from the global supply chain network, and structural path betweenness represents how much CO2 emissions from the supply chain paths a sector has in global supply chain network. I applied the combined method to the EORA database which covers 189 countries and focused on the whole global supply chain networks in detail. The results demonstrate that the global supply chain networks of transport equipment were well separated into emission clusters with higher emissions that consist of sectors with higher structural path betweenness. Chinese emission clusters were identified from the global supply chain networks for the five countries in question and the betweenness of Chinese sectors tend to be higher values in the supply chain networks. In this study, I suggested supply chain management of high priority sectors for a reduction in CO2 emissions of transport equipment in the producing countries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Anomaly detection has been becoming an important problem in several domains. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect anomalies in time series based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. After being trained on normal data, the networks are used to predict interested steps in time series. The difference between the predicted values and observed values is calculated as prediction errors. Then we use a kernel estimator of the quantile function to compute a threshold, which is used to determine anomalous observations. The performance of proposed method is illustrated through an example of anomaly detection of consumer demand in supply chain management. The numerical experiment shows that our approach achieve a higher level of detection accuracy and a lower percentage of false alarm rate compared to the previous One-Class Support Vector Machine method. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a clustering approach to segment supply chain partners in the automobile industry and prioritize services offered by third party logistics service (3PL) providers. Design/methodology/ approach - In total, 98 automobile and auto-parts manufacturers are surveyed to identify service needs, preferences, and outsourcing commitments. By applying a two-stage clustering approach combined with Ward's minimum-variance method and the K-means algorithm, the logistics companies prioritize their services to better satisfy groups of customers with specific preferences. Findings - Four distinctive groups of manufacturers are identified using the two-stage clustering approach. The clusters separate logistic preferences and outsourcing patterns of after market parts suppliers, original equipment service parts suppliers, original equipment manufacturer parts suppliers, and tier one car makers. The paper finds that distribution and delivery services hold the highest percentage of services outsourced among the manufacturers. Originality/value - This paper models logistic services as customizable services and develops a data system methodology to define the profiles of automobile manufacturers and their preferred logistic services. Through the analysis of service preferences and clustering, the paper identifies the key logistic services that can be customized for members of the automobile supply chain. A case is provided which demonstrates how a logistics company can provide customized service designs for specific target markets and customers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {Predictive power is an important objective for current business performance measurement systems and it is based on metrics design, collection and preprocessing of data and predictive modeling. A promising but less studied preprocessing activity is to construct additional features that can be interpreted to express the quality of data and thus provide predictive models not only data points but also their quality characteristics. The research problem addressed in this study is: can we improve the predictive power of business performance measurement systems by constructing additional data quality features? Unsupervised, supervised and domain knowledge approaches were used to operationalize eight features based on elementary data quality dimensions. In the case studies five corporate datasets Toyota Material Handling Finland, Innolink group, 3stepIt, Papua Merchandising and Lempesti constructed data quality features performed better than minimally processed data sets in 29/38 and equally in 9/38 tests. Comparison to a competing method of preprocessing combinations with the first two datasets showed that constructed features had slightly lower prediction performance, but they were clearly better in execution time and easiness of use. Additionally, constructed data quality features helped to visually explore high dimensional data quality patterns. Further research is needed to expand the range of constructed features and to map the findings systematically to data quality concepts and practices. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

 abstract = {The management of contemporary supply chains is complex because of their stochastic and dynamic nature. Also, modern supply chains are imbibed with agile characteristics. Several technologies have emerged for the management of agile supply chains. But most of them are in development stages. No common method exists for evaluating agility in supply chains by both researchers and practitioners. The complex manufacturing systems necessitate the validation of innovative solutions using advanced managerial tools and techniques. The manufacturing paradigms have to be evaluated according to their short term action and long term benefits. This article reports the utilisation of fuzzy association rules mining (FARM) approach which enables the decision makers to make flexible decisions for evaluating agility in supply chains in the presence of attributes such as flexibility, profitability, quality, innovativeness, pro-activity, speed of response, cost and robustness. The approach has been applied in an Indian electronic switches manufacturing organisation. The experiences of the conduct of this research indicate that agility evaluation can be performed without constraints by the decision makers. The case study is being demonstrated in which agility of supply chains is evaluated by determining association rules from the database. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

 abstract = {Fuzzy C-Means clustering is among the most successful clustering techniques available in the literature. The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is one of the most studied NP-hard problems. CVRP has attracted the attention of many researchers due to its importance within the supply chain management field. This study aims to develop a fuzzy c-means clustering heuristic to efficiently solve the CVRP with large numbers of customers by using cluster-first route-second method (CFRS). CFRS is a two-phase technique, where in the first phase customers are grouped into, and in the second phase each cluster is solved independently as a traveling salesman problem (TSP). This work is concerned the clustering phase of the CFRS. The second phase of the CFRS method is solved using traditional optimization software. A modified demand weighted fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is developed to solve the clustering phase. Twentyfive instances are solved to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Some of them are large instances with more than 500 customers. Promising results in terms of accuracy and processing time are obtained. © 2020 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Purpose: A number of governments are making building information modeling (BIM) a mandatory requirement for all public works construction projects. While main contractors may be ready to comply with such requirements, the supply chain as whole may be vulnerable as lower-tier suppliers may not be able to adopt BIM. There is currently no objective approach to assessing BIM maturity; hence, this paper aims to develop a new approach to determine suppliers’ current vision and execution-based capabilities to exploit BIM and their capacity to reach a higher maturity level. Design/methodology/approach: Based on UK Government BIM maturity levels, the authors exploit a unique data set made available by a main contractor, to determine a data-driven approach, using K-means, to assess the capabilities and vision of its supply base. Findings: The authors find a direct comparison between our suggested K-means clusters and the UK Government’s BIM maturity levels. However, in interrogating specific cases, the authors find that using a subjective approach would have wrongly categorized certain companies. The authors also determine what capability and strategic developments are required for companies to move to a higher level. Research limitations/implications: The method aligns with the existing UK BIM maturity model and enhances the model by determining the likelihood of a supplier in progressing to a higher level of maturity. The research was with a single case company, exploiting their existing survey instrument and data. A more comprehensive study could be adopted with a generic survey questionnaire. Practical implications: The research may be exploited by companies to take a strategic approach to assess suppliers in BIM adoption and to establish supplier development mechanisms. Originality/value: The data-driven approach avoids ambiguity of categories and mis-categorizing suppliers. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

 abstract = {In this work, a multidepot multiperiod vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries (MDPVRPPD) is solved by optimizing logistics networks with collaboration and resource sharing among logistics service providers. The optimal solution can satisfy customer demands with periodic time characteristics and incorporate pickup and delivery services with maximum resource utilization. A collaborative mechanism is developed to rearrange both the open and closed vehicle routes among multiple pickup and delivery centers with improved transportation efficiency and reduced operational costs. The effects of resource sharing strategies combining customer information sharing, facility service sharing, and vehicle sharing are investigated across multiple service periods to maximize resource utilization and refine the resource configuration. A multiobjective optimization model is developed to formulate the MDPVRPPD so that the minimum total operational costs, waiting time, and the number of vehicles are obtained. A hybrid heuristic algorithm incorporating a 3D clustering and an improved multiobjective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO) algorithm is introduced to solve the MDPVRPPD and find Pareto optimal solutions. The proposed hybrid heuristic algorithm is based on a selective exchange mechanism that enhances local and global searching capabilities. Results demonstrate that the proposed IMOPSO outperforms other existing algorithms. We also study profit allocation issues to quantify the stability and sustainability of long-term collaboration among logistics participants, using the minimum costs remaining savings method. The proposed model and solution methods are validated by conducting an empirical study of a real system in Chongqing City, China. This study contributes to the development of efficient urban logistics distribution systems, and facilitates the expansion of intelligent and sustainable supply chains. © 2020 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, the critical dimensions (CD) of semiconductor manufacturing processes are gradually declining, and various materials, reactants, or machine equipment is becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, the green supply chain management (GSCM) of smart high-tech factories has also become the target of competition for cutting-edge companies, because of this management. The more mature the mechanism of high production speed, lower operating costs and the higher the quality. In addition, corporate social responsibility (CSR) governance has also become an important investment evaluation item for semiconductor factories in recent years. As long as internationally renowned manufacturers start CSR, it is a pity that there are already some manufacturers. The establishment of a supply chain management system also synchronously promotes CSR, but there are few manufacturers that integrate CSR and green supply chain management, let alone the application of an intelligent management platform (IMP). This study builds a GSM platform (GSMP) based on the aforementioned problems, and the cluster analysis of K-means is used to optimize the management platform to optimize the overall performance of the management platform. Through the simulation results of this study, it is found that the performance of this management platform is far superior to the current mechanism of using human operation, whether it is the speed of emergency processing or the final management operation performance, which shows that this study industry contribution. © 2020 IEEE.},

@article{Wehrle2020356,
 abstract = {In the field of supply chain management (SCM), attracting and developing appropriate talent is critical for achieving most SCM goals, as extensive skills are necessary to do the job properly. In order to ensure that future-proof talent can continue to emerge in this discipline, the role of SCM executives is extremely important. Although many studies have been conducted in the field of talent management (TM), the future role of SCM executives has been mostly neglected in research. The present empirical study addresses this gap, taking into consideration the fourth industrial revolution, as innovation in technology continues to drive significant changes in the SCM field. Aiming to investigate the extent to which increasing digitalization is influencing the future role of SCM executives, a Delphi study with 103 experts from industry, academics, and politics/associations was carried out. In order to identify meaningful topic clusters from the data, fuzzy c-means clustering was used. From an actor-network theory perspective, our results show that in some areas of TM, digitalization is leading to a strong fusion of SCM executives and digital technologies, as well as to a clear division of roles, in which either SCM leaders or technology will dominate in the future. © 2021 The Authors.

 abstract = {Environmental management in the Chinese manufacturing industry has
attracted global attention. Using environmental indicator data from 2001
to 2010 for this industry, we empirically examine its environmental
management efficiency using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and
Hierarchical Clustering methods. Our findings reveal that the
environmental management of the Chinese manufacturing industry has more
DEA inefficiency than efficiency. Environmental management efficiency
showed a significant decline before 2004, but rapid growth since 2007.
Our findings also indicate that there is input redundancy and output
insufficiency in the manufacturing industry's environmental management
from 2002 to 2004. In addition, we found that most manufacturing sectors
in China had consistently inefficient environmental management over the
10 years under study. Overall, our findings reveal that efficiency
remains low. Thus, the manufacturing industry's environmental management
needs to improve from the perspective of enterprises and government. We
hope that our study paves the way for future research into improving the
manufacturing industry's environmental management in emerging countries.

 abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the implementation
of sustainable manufacturing practices in Malaysian palm oil mills
(POMs) by comparing the status of their current achievements and the
levels of priority placed on their practices.
Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was used to collect
data about 20 sustainable manufacturing practices from 51 POMs located
in Malaysia. A five-point Likert scale was considered for recording
variations in priorities and current practices with regard to
sustainable manufacturing. A Cronbach's a reliability test and a
binomial test were undertaken to assess the internal consistency and the
validity of the survey data. Spearman's. correlation analysis was
employed to determine the linear correlation between each of the
sustainability practices identified. Factor analysis was conducted to
reduce the number of sustainable manufacturing practices based on factor
loading and to derive a clustering of these factors.
Findings - The results showed that employees' well-being has the highest
level in terms of both priority and current achievement. However, for
other sustainable manufacturing practices, there was a difference where
the current achievement of these practices in the Malaysian POMs was
seen to be slightly lower than the priority given to them. Strong
correlation of significant value was observed between the minimization
of production waste and pollution prevention practices. From factor
analysis, 15 practices of high factor loading were grouped into a
proactive sustainability strategy and a preventive sustainability
strategy.
Research limitations/implications - The study was still relatively
exploratory. Future studies could investigate the barriers to the
implementation of sustainable manufacturing practices at Malaysian POMs.
The sample, which consisted of 51 Malaysian POMs, represented an
important sector of the Malaysian economy. Reliance on stated, rather
than revealed, preferences may limit the implications of the analysis
undertaken for this study, but it does represent a major step forward in
understanding the past in what was a highly recommended sector for
investigation due to the paucity of extant data. A more broadly based,
random sample of POMs from other countries would provide a better
understanding of issues related to sustainable manufacturing practices.
Practical implications - The results of this study can be used by
practitioners to adjust the sustainable manufacturing practices
currently applied and further studies may go on to examine the reasons
and implications for discrepancies between priorities and desired
sustainability goals in more detail.
Originality/value - The survey conducted about sustainable manufacturing
practices amongst Malaysian POMs was focussed on the three dimensions of
sustainability, namely, the economic, environmental, and social elements
involved.},

 abstract = {As enterprises pay more and more attention to environmental issues, the
green supply chain management (GSCM) mode has been extensively utilized
to guarantee profit and sustainable development. Green supplier
selection (GSS), which is a key segment of GSCM, has been investigated
to put forward plenty of GSS approaches. At present, enterprises prefer
to construct the large-scale teams of decision makers to obtain the more
reasonable ranking results during GSS process. However, the existing
methods pay little attention to the large-scale GSS procedure. To
investigate the GSS issue with a large-scale group of decision makers, a
new GSS approach under a q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy
environment is developed. The q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy
numbers are introduced to describe the evaluation information of green
suppliers. Combined with a clustering approach and several clustering
principles, the large-scale decision makers are divided into several
subgroups. Next, the similarity measures between the evaluation matrices
are computed to determine the weights of subgroups, and the collective
evaluation information can be obtained using the q-rung interval-valued
orthopair fuzzy aggregation operator. According to the weighted entropy
measure, the weights of criteria are calculated; then, the q-rung
interval-valued orthopair fuzzy multi-objective optimization on the
basis of ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form
(q-RIVOF-MULTIMOORA) method is constructed to determine the best green
supplier. At last, a practical GSS example is applied to show the
feasibility of the proposed approach, and the sensitivity and
comparative analyses indicate that for the large-scale GSS issues, the
proposed approach can obtain the more robust and reasonable ranking
results.},

of airline green operations strategy. Design/methodology/approach To
this end, a sample of 23 airlines from five regions (North America,
South America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East) was surveyed. The
annual sustainability reports of the surveyed airlines for the period
2013-2016 were retrieved from the Global Reporting Initiatives website.
K-means clustering analysis was used to generate taxonomic clusters of
airline green operations strategy. A special data analysis technique,
called rank analysis, was also adopted to identify the significant green
actions and develop indicative models. Findings This study revealed that
three effective taxonomies were adopted by airlines: a low-effect
strategic pattern, a low-to-moderate effect strategic pattern and a
high-effect strategic pattern. A different combination of green
operation actions characterized each strategic pattern.
Originality/value The research contribution of taxonomies of green
operations strategy has so far been limited, country focused and
concentrated on the manufacturing sector. This study reported the
taxonomies and performed an in-depth analysis of the categories of
effective actions taken to promote green performance. Moreover, this
study developed indicative models for the relationship between
categories of action and green performance for each strategic pattern,
an action that has seldom been reported by previous studies of green
operations strategies for airlines.},

 abstract = {Facility Layout Design (FLP) is an NP-Hard, which is related to the
optimization of the arrangement of facilities in a shop floor or
manufacturing unit to maximize the performance and minimize the
operating cost. An efficient layout must not only consider the profit
but also emphasize on other social causes such as energy consumption,
pollution, and people's safety. These are referred to as the three
pillars of sustainability. This paper identifies the criteria for
sustainability in a manufacturing layout and presents an aggregate
mathematical formulation for Sustainable Facility Layout Problem (SFLP).
The paper proposes a novel 4-stage methodology using Big Data Analytics,
Machine Learning, Hybrid Meta-heuristic, Data Envelopment Analysis
(DEA), and K-mean clustering for designing an energy-efficient
sustainable sub-optimal layout under uncertain (stochastic) demand over
multiple periods. The goal of this framework is to 1) uniquely rank and
predict an efficient SFLP that overcomes the dimensionality curse
associated with handling large data set, 2) use K-mean to identify the
criteria that maximally satisfied an efficient sustainable layout and
propose an SFLP model that can be customized depending social, political
and economic conditions, and 3) evaluate the total energy consumption
and CO2 emission for an efficient sustainable facility layout. To show
the running methodology a case is presented using hypothetical data from

on the number of times two items are picked together and the picking
frequency of items, respectively and results are embedded into our
optimization model. Also, a greedy heuristic is developed to solve SLAP
of the firm. Analysis results show that there is an improvement of up to
49.99% in total distances between filled slots and the I/O point due to

 abstract = {The emergence of online retailers has brought new opportunities to the
design of their distribution networks. Notably, for online retailers
that do not operate offline stores, their target customers are more
sensitive to the quality of logistic services, such as delivery speed
and reliability. This paper is motivated by a leading online retailer
for cosmetic products on Taobao.com that aimed to improve its logistics
efficiency by redesigning its centralized distribution network into a
multilevel one. The multilevel distribution network consists of a layer
of primary facilities to hold stocks from suppliers and transshipment
and a layer of secondary facilities to provide last-mile delivery. There
are two major challenges of designing such a facility network. First,
online customers can respond signifi-cantly to the change of logistics
efficiency with the redesigned network, thereby rendering the network
optimized under the original demand distribution suboptimal. Second,
because online retailers have relatively small sales volumes and are
very flexible in choosing facility locations, the facility candidate set
can be large, causing the facility location optimization challenging to
solve. To this end, we propose an iterative prediction-and-optimization
strategy for distribution network design. Specifically, we first develop
an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict customer demands,
factoring in the logistic service quality given the network and the
city-level purchasing power based on demographic statistics. Then, a
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to choose
facility locations with minimum transportation, facility setup, and
package processing costs. We further develop an efficient two-stage
heuristic for computing high-quality solutions to the MILP model,
featuring an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm and an
expectation and maximization algorithm. Subsequently, the ANN demand
predictor and two-stage heuristic are integrated for iterative network
design. Finally, using a real-world data set, we validate the demand
prediction accuracy and demonstrate the mutual interdependence between
the demand and network design.
Summary of Contribution: We propose an iterative
prediction-and-optimization algorithm for multilevel distribution
network design for e-logistics and evaluate its operational value for
online retailers. We address the issue of the interplay between
distribution network design and the demand distribution using an
iterative framework. Further, combining the idea in operational research
and data mining, our paper provides an end-to-end solution that can
provide accurate predictions of online sales distribution, subsequently
solving large-scale optimization problems for distribution network
design problems.},

 abstract = {Background: Food loss management (FLM), which is discussed at length in
the literature, lacks a scientific basis on which to determine the
current engagement of actors in the food value chain and what is
relevant to derive appropriate measures according to the circumstances
in the organisations concerned. Therefore, this paper aims to derive
patterns by which the engagement of actors can be distinguished and, on
this basis, to make recommendations for further action. Methods: Based
on an online survey of 40 participants, a clustering analysis was
conducted using the unsupervised learning method and hierarchical
clustering (R and R Studio). Results: Five clusters representing
different profiles were derived, showing how actors in the food value
chain have addressed FLM in the past. The derived profiles do not
represent stages of development but rather characteristics of
organisations that have addressed FLM in a certain way in the past.
Conclusions: For the five organisational profiles, recommendations for
action were given for further engagement with FLM. As the level of
engagement with FLM increases, organisations should tackle increasingly
complex measures to reduce food losses. At the same time, a shift in
measures from the tactical to the strategic planning level was derived.},

 abstract = {In view of the complex network characteristics of cluster supply chain, this paper studies the core enterprise identification method of cluster supply chain. Combining complex network theory with supply chain management idea, complex network model and complex network topology structure of cluster supply chain were created. From the aspects of network topology properties and business operation for enterprise nodes, the evaluation index system of core enterprise node importance was established in cluster supply chain complex network. Based on machine learning theory, the identification algorithm of core enterprise nodes in cluster supply chain complex network was proposed by an improved iterative self-organizing data analysis algorithm and K-means clustering algorithm. The simulation results verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. It can provide theoretical support for collaborative decision-making of cluster supply chain complex network. © 2019 by Aussino Academic Publishing House.},

Combining the factors that affect the planning of transportation corridor, this paper firstly uses the Fuzzy C-means Clustering method that is based on the objective function. Secondly, this paper establishes a model of transportation corridor planning and analyzes the fuzzy clustering of the ports and their hinterland. Finally, the paper concludes that the Weifang and Yingkou ports are suitable for the Ro-Ro and drayage transportation of cargos in Bohai Bay. Based on the result of clustering, the corridors between Shandong and Liaoning are constructed, which can provide a reference for the planning and construction of the Ro-Ro and Drayage transportation corridors. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

 abstract = {The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26 held in 2021 concluded a global effort to hasten the energy transition toward a net-zero emission industry. As such, green initiatives, which transition the conventional oil and gas (O&G) sector towards a circular economy (CE) are necessary. In this work, the integration of waste oil re-refining technology is proposed as a potential strategy to enhance the circularity of the O&G industry. A two-step sequential model, which incorporates multiple systematic analytical tools (e.g., multi-objective decision analysis, information entropy, geospatial information, clustering, and routing analysis) is developed to determine: (i) optimal waste oil re-refinery technologies, and (ii) optimal supply chain design, which addresses the location for setting up the process facilities and the delivery routes, with the consideration of both economic and environmental performances. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through a case study in Malaysia (that covers both East and West Malaysia). The analysis showed that the proposed strategy is capable of improving economic and environmental performances by about 9.59% and 46.55%, respectively. This work is essentially a useful reference for decision-makers and policymakers in making nationwide transition planning in the O&G sector. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {Unascertained means clustering methodology combines unascertained theory and clustering theory to construct unascertained measurements which measures the degree of collective affiliation between samples and category. By considering both financial and non-financial factors, this paper constructs a green supply chain performance evaluation system which contains 17 secondary indicators based on financial condition, customer service, operation flow and degree of green. According to this system, we apply the unascertained means clustering methodology to evaluate the performance of green supply chain, derive the clustering results and present the degree of affiliation of the samples. Unascertained average clustering theory solved the classification problem of green supply chain performance as well as improving the credibility of the evaluation. Finally, this paper ends up with the discussion of the feasibility and effectiveness of this system. ©2009 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, how to recognize the importance of customers is a key factor in assuring the success of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in e-supply chain. The paper firstly introduces the basic principle of SOM Neural Network. Secondly, it takes the improved SOM Clustering Algorithm as a tool to cluster and divide the customers in e-supply chain into different groups objectively and scientifically. The result of research strongly proved and supported the ''Pareto 80/20-principle''. Lastly, through clustering customers to each different group and recognizing the level of importance of customers in different groups (esp. the 20% VIP), there is some good suggestions to be put forward. It would be helpful to make some aimed marketing strategy for promotion, service, price etc and avoid the risk of taking the uniform-service strategy for all the customers or taking the subjective and unscienti-fic rank-service strategy to lose the potential VIP customers. Customers clustering analyze based on Neural Network is a comparatively novel method in CRM of e-supply Chain of books. © 2009 Binary Information Press March, 2009.},

 abstract = {Assessing the relationship between supply chain performance and organizational culture can help to predict scenarios and improve decision-making. However, this relationship is rarely explored due to the complexity of quantitatively addressing its natural subjectivity. Although soft computing techniques would have the potential to overcome this limitation, they have been rarely applied to this context. This paper aims to introduce a decision model to analyze and quantify the causal relationship between organizational culture and supply chain performance based on the combination of fuzzy grey cognitive maps, grey clustering and multiple fuzzy inference systems. Such model is novel in the literature and can provide new theoretical and practical perspectives. The development of this study is based on the SCOR® (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model attributes (SCC, 2017) and Hofstede's (2001) organizational practices, following the quantitative axiomatic prescriptive model-based research. The main contribution is the introduction of a decision-making model that promotes the alignment between organizational culture and supply chain management, internalizing culture as a driver for performance improvement efforts. By conducting two real application cases in companies from different industrial sectors, results show that the model is able to identify crucial elements regarding cultural profile and performance for both organizations, aiding prioritization, anticipation and enabling the development of guidelines for action plans. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and reduce the bullwhip effect in fuzzy environments by means of type-2 fuzzy methodology. In order to reduce the bullwhip effect in a supply chain, we propose a new method for demand forecasting. First, the demand data of a real steel industry in Canada is clustered with an interval type-2 fuzzy c-regression clustering algorithm. Then, a novel interval type-2 fuzzy hybrid expert system is developed for demand forecasting. This system uses Fuzzy Disjunctive Normal Forms (FDNF) and Fuzzy Conjunctive Normal Forms (FCNF) for the aggregation of antecedents. An interval type- 2 fuzzy order policy is developed to determine orders in the supply chain. Then, the results of the proposed method are compared with the type-1 fuzzy expert system as well as the type-1 fuzzy time series method in the literature. The results show that the bullwhip effect is significantly reduced; also, the system has less error and high accuracy. © 2013 Sharif University of Technology. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been dominant learning techniques for more than ten years, and mostly applied to supervised learning problems. These years two-class unsupervised and semi-supervised classification algorithms based on Bounded C-SVMs, Bounded ν-SVMs, Lagrangian SVMs (LSVMs) and robust version to Bounded C∈- SVMs respectively, and which are relaxed to Semi-definite Programming (SDP), get good classification results. The time consumed of method based on robust version to BC-SVMs is too long. So it seems necessary to find a faster method, which has almost accurate results as above at least. Therefore we proposed robust version to unsupervised and semi-supervised classification algorithms based on Lagrangian Support Vector Machines and its application on evaluation of supply chain management performance. Numerical results confirm the robustness of the proposed method and show that our new unsupervised and semi-supervised classification algorithms based on LSVMs often obtain almost the same accurate results as other algorithms,while considerably faster than them. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

 abstract = {In all information systems it is very important to operate with correct information. Incorrect information can lead to many problems that can cause direct financial and reputation loss of the company. Data used by the system can be gathered by sensors, scripts or by hand. In all those cases, mistakes are possible. It is important to detect mistakes on time and stop them from propagating further into the system. In this paper, a novel multi-step anomaly detection algorithm based on the greatest common divisor and median value is described. The algorithm for anomaly detection in historical sales data is used as a part of the smart warehouse management system which is implemented in some of the largest distribution companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The algorithm showed significant results in anomaly detection on company orders and improved a number of processes in the operation of the smart warehouse management system. The algorithm described can also be used in other areas where the transaction data is collected, such as sales and banking, © 2020 IEEE.},

 abstract = {In large urban agglomerations, various logistical problems arise due to high population density and deficient transport infrastructure. City logistics involves the efficient distribution of freight transport in urban areas and approaches to mitigate environmental impacts and traffic congestion. This paper aims to use a two-step cluster analytic approach to segmentation of EU27 capital cities based on their city logistics performance. To obtain primary outcomes, the log-likelihood measure in SPSS Statistics was used. The results can be used to identify the development and implementation of logistics measures in capitals across the EU. In addition to clustering, the statistical analysis evaluates the position of investigated cities concerning traffic congestions, and from an environmental point of view, the carbon dioxide produced from transport. The scrutiny delivers practical outlooks on how clustering can be undertaken and proves how the clusters can be used to plan city logistics and supply chain management. Finally, the paper deals with smart city indices from the perspective of sustainable mobility and examines its correlation with city logistics. © 2021 by the authors.

 abstract = {Transportation management, as a part of the supply chain management, is a complex process that consists of planning and delivering goods to customers. The paper presents a complete multi-phase intelligent and adaptive transportation management system, which includes data collection, parameter tuning, and the heuristic algorithm based on the Tabu search for vehicle routing. The paper describes the procedure for collecting Global Positioning System (GPS) data and analyzing the compliance with the proposed routes based on the data collected. The described routing algorithm is powerful and supports many real-world limitations. An algorithm for the anomaly detection in the GPS data is presented as well as the usage of collected GPS data to improve the future results of the algorithm. The concept was implemented and tested on real data in some of the largest distribution companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The proposed approach resulted with more than satisfactory results in real-world application. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},
