Title = {Green scheduling to achieve green manufacturing: Pursuing a research
   agenda by mapping science},

Abstract = {The strengthening of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions meant
   that manufacturing scheduling had to acquire a green approach. The need
   to reduce energy consumption becomes necessary for companies to achieve
   sustainable development. Therefore, a new challenge for the scientific
   community was foreseen, researching new algorithms or knowledge hubs to
   achieve green scheduling. Green scheduling may be considered one of the
   principles of green manufacturing, aimed at minimizing environmental
   damage and energy waste. A review of the literature shows that there are
   no research works that analyze the scientific development carried out in
   ``green scheduling{''} through methodologies based on bibliometric
   analysis, thus the need and the novelty of this research. Based on a
   dataset formed by 420 scientific documents published from 2006 to 2020 a
   bibliometric and network analysis is carried out to find the scientific
   trends, the main relationships according to collaborations and
   intermediaries, and the research hubs that help to establish the
   research agenda. The results show that ``green scheduling{''} is a
   growing research area in the scientific community and in recent years
   the number of new research topics has experienced considerable growth.
   This research is developed in Asia, Europe and America, but China stands
   out as the most productive, collaborative, intermediary, influential and
   active country at present, through its organizations which are mainly
   universities, such as Huanzhong University of Science and Technology and
   Tongji University. However, research development related to green
   scheduling is carried out in a collaborative environment between
   institutions located in different countries, allowing countries that are
   not scientific powerhouses to develop research in the area. The network
   analysis makes it possible to define the research framework through the
   clustering of the dataset's research keywords, highlighting that the
   main areas of research focus on the development of new methods through
   algorithms aimed at improving energy efficiency in production
   environments, in areas of computational development such as cloud
   computing, and in transportation. The most cited research papers,
   considered the main drivers of knowledge, are published in high-quality
   research journals, and are mainly developments in scheduling algorithms
   for different work environments with a green approach. Research findings
   can provide the academic community with relevant information about green
   scheduling to make appropriate decisions and become a research agenda
   for future research.},

Title = {A bibliometric, social network and clustering analysis for a

Abstract = {Green energy production has gained significance during recent years due
   to the Paris agreement considering carbon emissions. One of the leading
   sources of energy production in the aforementioned aspects is wind
   energy. Even though the service life of a wind turbine (WT) is
   considered long (20-40 years), it is expected to confront a significant
   number of end-of-life (EOL) WTs in the medium term. In order to acquire
   maximum value, operations for EOL WTs have a crucial place. These
   operations are mainly referred as recycling, decommissioning,
   rema-nufacturing, and disposal. There are several key factors confronted
   during these processes such as transportation, center attendance, route
   decision, integration into circular economy, and disassembly of WTs etc.
   Therefore, a sustainable process is required for dealing with WTs at the
   EOL in order to maximize the environmental benefits of wind power and
   value creation. A comprehensive literature review was conducted in this
   study in order to accomplish the aforementioned aim, demonstrate the
   state-of-art-applications, and detect gaps. Almost 530 studies, which
   were conducted till January of 2022, are taken into consideration in the
   proposed study. Ac-cording to the results of the implemented analysis in
   the proposed study, the examined studies focused on WT blade integration
   into the circular economy, regulations, mechanical properties of
   recycled materials, supply chain issues, and so on. However, total life
   cycle assessment is not entirely considered as a whole. In addition,
   some critical gaps in the literature are detected, which are given as
   follows: combining the entire dismantling and repowering, investigating
   the variables that can help or hinder WT recovery in the long run,
   requirement for investigating the roles of technological breakthroughs,
   regulatory measures, and incentives in renewable tech-nology investment
   and production, and infrastructure and transportation data must be
   factored in to solve location allocation difficulties for disposal or
   disassembly plants. The proposed literature review consists of three
   main parts; the first part demonstrates bibliometric analysis of
   considered literature. The second part includes the descriptive
   analysis, and the third part comprehends the details of the received
   studies. In the third part, a detailed analysis of the studies is
   conducted. In the fourth part, interpretation of examined studies is
   proposed. At the end, gaps in the considered literature are detected and
   proposals for potential study subjects are indicated.},

Title = {Network analysis of swine movements in a multi-site pig production
   system in Iowa, USA},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {174},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Pig production in the United States is based on multi-site systems in
   which pigs are transported between farms after the conclusion of each
   particular production phase. Although ground transportation is a
   critical component of the pork supply chain, it might constitute a
   potential route of infectious disease dissemination. Here, we used a
   time series network analysis to: (1) describe pig movement flow in a
   multi-site production system in Iowa, USA, (2) conduct percolation
   analysis to investigate network robustness to interventions for diseases
   with different transmissibility, and (3) assess the potential impact of
   each farm type on disease dissemination across the system. Movement
   reports from 2014-2016 were provided by Iowa Select Farms, Iowa Fall,
   IA. A total of 76,566 shipments across sites was analyzed, and time
   series network analyses with temporal resolution of 1, 3, 6, 12, and 36
   months were considered. The general topological properties of networks
   with resolution of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were compared with the whole
   period static network (36 months) and included the following features:
   number of nodes and edges, degree assortativity, density, average path
   length, diameter, clustering coefficients, giant strongly connected
   component, giant weakly connected component, giant in component, and
   giant out component. Small-world and scale-free topologies, centrality
   parameters, and percolation analysis were investigated for the networks
   with 1-month window. Networks' robustness to interventions was assessed
   by using the Basic Reproduction Number (R-0). Centrality parameters
   indicate that gilt development units (GDU), nursery, and sow farms have
   more central role in the pig production hierarchical structure.
   Therefore, they are potentially major factors of introduction and spread
   of diseases over the system. Wean-to-finishing and finishing sites
   displayed high in-degree values, indicating that they are more
   susceptible to be infected. Percolation analysis combined with general
   properties (i.e. heavy-tailed distributions and degree disassortative)
   suggested that networks with 1-month time resolution were highly
   responsive to interventions. Furthermore, the characteristics of a
   disease should have strong implications in the biosecurity practices
   across production sites. For instance, biosecurity practices should be
   focused on sow farms for highly contagious disease (e.g., foot and mouth
   disease), while it should target nursery sites in the case of a less
   contagious diseases (i.e. mycobacterial infections). Understanding the
   patterns of swine movements is crucial for the swine industry
   decision-making in the case of an epidemic, as well as to design
   cost-effective approaches to monitor, prevent, control and eradicate
   infectious diseases in multi-site systems.},

Title = {Insights in the Global Genetics and Gut Microbiome of Black Soldier Fly,
   <i>Hermetia illucens</i>: Implications for Animal Feed Safety Control},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The utilization of the black soldier fly (BSF)Hermetia illucensL. for
   recycling organic waste into high-quality protein and fat biomass for
   animal feeds has gained momentum worldwide. However, information on the
   genetic diversity and environmental implications on safety of the larvae
   is limited. This study delineates genetic variability and unravels gut
   microbiome complex of wild-collected and domesticated BSF populations
   from six continents using mitochondrialCOIgene and 16S metagenomics. All
   sequences generated from the study linked toH. illucensaccessions
   KM967419.1, FJ794355.1, FJ794361.1, FJ794367.1, KC192965.1, and
   KY817115.1 from GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences
   generated from the study and rooted by GenBank accessions ofHermetia
   albitarsisFabricius andHermetia sexmaculataMacquart separated all
   samples into three branches, withH. illucensandH. sexmaculatabeing
   closely related. Genetic distances betweenH. illucenssamples from the
   study and GenBank accessions ofH. illucensranged between 0.0091 and
   0.0407 whileH. sexmaculataandH. albitarsissamples clearly separated from
   allH. illucensby distances of 0.1745 and 0.1903, respectively. Genetic
   distance matrix was used to generate a principal coordinate plot that
   further confirmed the phylogenetic clustering. Haplotype network map
   demonstrated that Australia, United States 1 (Rhode Island), United
   States 2 (Colorado), Kenya, and China shared a haplotype, while Uganda
   shared a haplotype with GenBank accessionBSF from United States. All
   other samples analyzed had individual haplotypes. Out of 481,695 reads
   analyzed from 16S metagenomics, four bacterial families
   (Enterobactereaceae, Dysgonomonadaceae, Wohlfahrtiimonadaceae, and
   Enterococcaceae) were most abundant in the BSF samples. Alpha-diversity,
   as assessed by Shannon index, showed that the Kenyan and Thailand
   populations had the highest and lowest microbe diversity, respectively;
   while microbial diversity assessed through Bray Curtis distance showed
   United States 3 (Maysville) and Netherlands populations to be the most
   dissimilar. Our findings on genetic diversity revealed slight
   phylogeographic variation between BSF populations across the globe. The
   16S data depicted larval gut bacterial families with economically
   important genera that might pose health risks to both animals and
   humans. This study recommends pre-treatment of feedstocks and
   postharvest measures of the harvested BSF larvae to minimize risk of
   pathogen contamination along the insect-based feed value chain.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the implementation
   of sustainable manufacturing practices in Malaysian palm oil mills
   (POMs) by comparing the status of their current achievements and the
   levels of priority placed on their practices.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was used to collect
   data about 20 sustainable manufacturing practices from 51 POMs located
   in Malaysia. A five-point Likert scale was considered for recording
   variations in priorities and current practices with regard to
   sustainable manufacturing. A Cronbach's a reliability test and a
   binomial test were undertaken to assess the internal consistency and the
   validity of the survey data. Spearman's. correlation analysis was
   employed to determine the linear correlation between each of the
   sustainability practices identified. Factor analysis was conducted to
   reduce the number of sustainable manufacturing practices based on factor
   loading and to derive a clustering of these factors.
   Findings - The results showed that employees' well-being has the highest
   level in terms of both priority and current achievement. However, for
   other sustainable manufacturing practices, there was a difference where
   the current achievement of these practices in the Malaysian POMs was
   seen to be slightly lower than the priority given to them. Strong
   correlation of significant value was observed between the minimization
   of production waste and pollution prevention practices. From factor
   analysis, 15 practices of high factor loading were grouped into a
   proactive sustainability strategy and a preventive sustainability
   strategy.
   Research limitations/implications - The study was still relatively
   exploratory. Future studies could investigate the barriers to the
   implementation of sustainable manufacturing practices at Malaysian POMs.
   The sample, which consisted of 51 Malaysian POMs, represented an
   important sector of the Malaysian economy. Reliance on stated, rather
   than revealed, preferences may limit the implications of the analysis
   undertaken for this study, but it does represent a major step forward in
   understanding the past in what was a highly recommended sector for
   investigation due to the paucity of extant data. A more broadly based,
   random sample of POMs from other countries would provide a better
   understanding of issues related to sustainable manufacturing practices.
   Practical implications - The results of this study can be used by
   practitioners to adjust the sustainable manufacturing practices
   currently applied and further studies may go on to examine the reasons
   and implications for discrepancies between priorities and desired
   sustainability goals in more detail.
   Originality/value - The survey conducted about sustainable manufacturing
   practices amongst Malaysian POMs was focussed on the three dimensions of
   sustainability, namely, the economic, environmental, and social elements
   involved.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to characterise the quality of meat from
   commercially-raised rabbits. Animals came from five different producers
   and were slaughtered in three different plants under provincial or
   federal inspection jurisdiction. Animal behaviour evaluated by scan
   sampling prior to feed withdrawal (FW) and transport, as well as blood
   lactate concentration at exsanguination, did not raise concerns with
   respect to stress. Stomach pH was higher (P=0.047) when the FW time was
   short (<= 13.5 h), at a mean value of 2.23. All pH values measured 1 h
   post-mortem from the Biceps femoris (BF) and almost all (97.6\%) from
   the Longissimus lumborum (LL) were higher than 6. Values for ultimate pH
   measured 24 h post-mortem (pH(u)) ranged from 5.80 to 6.83 and from 5.70
   to 6.70 for BF and LL muscles, respectively. The maximum meat drip loss
   recorded was 2.6\%, while cooking loss reached 30\%. Meat lightness (I2)
   and colour intensity (C{*}) for the long RN times (>= 23 h) were no
   different from those with short and intermediate (15.5 to 17.3 h) FW
   times. However, these colour parameters were higher for the short RN
   time class compared to the Intermediate RN time class (P<0.02). A
   hierarchical cluster analysis based on pH(u), cooking loss and lightness
   (L{*}) from 200 rabbit loins was performed. Of the four clusters
   created, clusters 1 and 2 had the best and second-best meat quality,
   respectively. Clusters 3 and 4 had the lowest meat quality and presented
   DFD-like (dark, firm and dry) characteristics. Meat did not exhibit
   PSE-like (pale, soft, exudative) characteristics, even for the slaughter
   lot with the minimum mean pH(u). Of the eight slaughter lots evaluated,
   more than 50\% of the meat from three of them fell into clusters 3 and
   4; all three were in the Intermediate RN time class. Overall, the
   quality of rabbit meat analysed was acceptable for commercial use, but
   rather variable. This suggests that there are factors within the value
   chain that are not yet fully controlled and require further
   Investigation.},

Title = {Impacts of regional integration and maritime transport on trade: with
   special reference to RCEP},
Journal = {MARITIME BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {143-158},
Abstract = {Purpose - The proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership
   (RCEP) will become a large trade agreement in Asia, which has brought
   together the ten members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations
   (ASEAN) and five of the neighbors' countries. Under the trend of
   globalization, the progress of the transportation industry and regional
   integration will increase the volume of trade, therefore maritime
   performance is intrinsically linked to trade. In fact, few studies have
   examined regional integration in the context of seaborne. This paper
   aims to use the cluster analysis and Poisson quasi-maximum likelihood
   (PQML) gravity model to investigate the trading bloc phenomenon and
   relation between trade and marine transportation.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, hierarchical clustering
   analysis and tree diagrams are used to identify functional areas
   characterized by bilateral trade intensity and bilateral liner shipping
   connectivity indices. Regional reorganizations that have occurred within
   Asian countries were studied. This study illustrates that these trading
   blocs have a positive impact on trade when maritime transport,
   production and trading networks have developed between regions. A
   gravity model was constructed using worldwide trade data for 2007, 2010
   and 2015. The study considered free trade agreement (FTA)/common market
   (CM) of EU, RCEP and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as
   regional dummies and designed a real trade bloc induction variable. In
   addition, the study did not use the commonly adopted ordinary least
   squares (OLS) estimation but used the PQML method to estimate the
   gravity equation to overcome the problem of a large number of zero trade
   observations. Preliminary results show that regional integration cannot
   guarantee the establishment of intraregional trade but depends on the
   stage of economic development and regional industrial characteristics.
   Findings - The major findings are summarized as follows. Both the
   ``nominal{''} intra-RCEP trade was significantly below the ``real{''}
   trading blocs. For RCEP, the effect created by intra-regional trade is
   better than that of the EU. Instead, ``nominal{''} intra-RCEP trade is
   much lower than ``real{''} trading blocs. The real trading bloc between
   East Asia and Taiwan clearly exists, and the bloc phenomenon is becoming
   more and more significant. This result shows that Taiwan's trade flow
   with East Asia is higher than the normal level relationship implied by
   its corresponding economic and geographical conditions.
   Originality/value - This paper focuses on new empirical work done for
   this study is on the potential impact on trade. Earlier studies that
   have discussed and/or provided estimates of the benefits to the RCEP
   plan from improved transport and supply chain connectivity are cited.
   Marine transportation performance inherently links to economies of
   commerce. Few studies have examined regional integration in the context
   of maritime transportation, which reflects the lack of a mix of trade
   economists and maritime logistics research in the existing literature.
   This paper attempts to investigate the trading bloc phenomenon formed by
   regional integration (such as RCEP) and the relation between trade and
   marine transportation. With the official entry into force of the RCEP in
   2020, it will promote increased trade and demand for logistics and
   maritime transport services in East Asia.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Most successful companies have adopted some type of
   improvement methodology to achieve optimum performance, high quality,
   lower costs and productivity. Some of the structured methodologies
   employed indiscriminately are total quality management, quality control,
   agile, lean and Six Sigma which yield varied results. The purpose of
   this paper is to explore how to harness the power of an integrated
   system of quality tools and techniques to create operational excellence.
   An integrated framework involves matching quality tools and techniques
   to the multi-phases (input, transformation and output) of lean
   manufacturing or service ecosystem.
   Design/methodology/approach - Current research of lean quality systems
   provides a conceptual understanding of core tools employed by
   manufacturing and service organizations. Interviewing domain experts
   from a series of manufacturing and service organizations highlighted a
   common challenge. The challenge was lean tools and methodologies were
   selected and employed arbitrarily for the different operational phases,
   which resulted in selective synergies of tools between operational
   phases. This limitation resulted in rework and duplication of quality
   efforts through the diverse phases of the transformation system. This
   study is based on the hypothesis that all phases of an operational
   system must be linked by common tools and methodologies which enables
   harnessing quality benefits and synergies throughout the entire
   operational system. The study methodology trailed through cooperative
   inquiry using a case study approach to design an integrated framework of
   tools that facilitates a common platform for manufacturing or service
   ecosystems.
   Findings - This study suggests that quality systems in a complex
   competitive environment must consider an integrated iterative approach.
   An iterative development of lean quality tools for multiple phases
   produces an integrated quality system. Such systems employ blending and
   extending of lean quality tools to multiple phases of the transformation
   system to synthesize agile and versatile quality system.
   Research limitations/implications - A limitation of this study is that
   the research of integrated framework is based on repertory grid
   technique only; it should be supplemented by other methods. Second, the
   proposed framework does not consider the complexity added by the
   internal and external stakeholders as they interface with the integrated
   system at different points with reference to phases of the system.
   Practical implications - One of the advantages of this method is its
   generality, instead of delivering a monolithic system at the culmination
   of long transformation process we rely on smaller quality sprints which
   are implemented sequentially at each stage or phase of the
   transformation system. The phenomena of incremental clustering of
   time-series of quality sprints for different phases results in true
   integration from end to end for a transformation system.
   Social implications - This study helps investigate the personal
   constructs that users and managers employ to interpret and select
   quality tools or methodologies for the different phases of lean
   transformational system.
   Originality/value - This study aims to understand the impact of blending
   quality and business process improvement tools and methodologies to
   enhance outcomes. The basis of this study is the power of multiplicity
   through which a diverse collection of improvement paths is pooled into
   an integrated framework of quality tools for lean and efficient
   operations.},

Abstract = {The emerging biobased economy is causing shifts from mineral fossil oil
   based resources towards renewable resources. Because of market
   mechanisms, current and new industries utilising renewable commodities,
   will attempt to secure their supply of resources. Cellulose is among
   these commodities, where large scale competition can be expected and
   already is observed for the traditional industries such as the paper
   industry.
   Cellulose and lignocellulosic raw materials (like wood and non-wood
   fibre crops) are being utilised in many industrial sectors. Due to the
   initiated transition towards biobased economy, these raw materials are
   intensively investigated also for new applications such as 2nd
   generation biofuels and `green' chemicals and materials production
   (Clark, 2007; Lange, 2007; Petrus \& Noordermeer, 2006; Ragauskas et
   al., 2006; Regalbuto, 2009). As lignocellulosic raw materials are
   available in variable quantities and qualities, unnecessary competition
   can be avoided via the choice of suitable raw materials for a target
   application. For example, utilisation of cellulose as carbohydrate
   source for ethanol production (Kabir Kazi et al., 2010) avoids the
   discussed competition with easier digestible carbohydrates (sugars,
   starch) deprived from the food supply chain. Also for cellulose use as a
   biopolymer several different competing markets can be distinguished. It
   is clear that these applications and markets will be influenced by large
   volume shifts. The world will have to reckon with the increase of
   competition and feedstock shortage (land use/biodiversity) (van Dam, de
   Klerk-Engels, Struik, \& Rabbinge, 2005).
   It is of interest - in the context of sustainable development of the
   bioeconomy - to categorize the already available and emerging
   lignocellulosic resources in a matrix structure. When composing such
   ``cellulose resource matrix{''} attention should be given to the quality
   aspects as well as to the available quantities and practical
   possibilities of processing the feedstock and the performance in the
   end-application.
   The cellulose resource matrix should become a practical tool for
   stakeholders to make choices regarding raw materials, process or market.
   Although there is a vast amount of scientific and economic information
   available on cellulose and lignocellulosic resources, the accessibility
   for the interested layman or entrepreneur is very difficult and the
   relevance of the numerous details in the larger context is limited.
   Translation of science to practical accessible information with modern
   data management and data integration tools is a challenge.
   Therefore, a detailed matrix structure was composed in which the
   different elements or entries of the matrix were identified and a
   tentative rough set up was made. The inventory includes current
   commodities and new cellulose containing and raw materials as well as
   exotic sources and specialties. Important chemical and physical
   properties of the different raw materials were identified for the use in
   processes and products. When available, the market data such as price
   and availability were recorded. Established and innovative cellulose
   extraction and refining processes were reviewed. The demands on the raw
   material for suitable processing were collected. Processing parameters
   known to affect the cellulose properties were listed. Current and
   expected emerging markets were surveyed as well as their different
   demands on cellulose raw materials and processes.
   The setting up of the cellulose matrix as a practical tool requires two
   steps Firstly, the reduction of the needed data by clustering of the
   characteristics of raw materials, processes and markets and secondly,
   the building of a database that can provide the answers to the questions
   from stakeholders with an indicative character. This paper describes the
   steps taken to achieve the defined clusters of most relevant and
   characteristic properties. These data can be expanded where required.
   More detailed specification can be obtained from the background
   literature and handbooks. Where gaps of information are identified, the
   research questions can be defined that will require further
   investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
